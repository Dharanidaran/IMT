2;I ordered on Jan 1 and the total for 4 med pizza and wings came up to over $50. The stuffed crust pizza cost me extra money but it did not show on the website. Regardless, the pizza crust tasted like cardboard and Pizza pizza is way better. They cheaped out on the toppings and my chicken and hamm pizza only had a few pieces on chicken where only 2 slices and 2 small pieces of chicken on it. for the price, i could have gotten more and better pizza somewhere else. I am very disappointed with this location. They also ran out of shrimp which was advertised on the website but i ordered early so i am assuming they did not want to give me shrimp. made a complaint to pizza hut and no response.
3;The service was soooo slow, impolite staff, and the food was uncooked. I really don't recommend it.
4;By far this is the worst pizza Hut location I had ever been. I went over there with my wife. To begin with our waiter kept us waiting for more than 15 minutes just to take the order. After we ordered we waited more than 45 minutes to get our pizza. When we got our pizza it was cold. We called the waiter to explain all the situation and then the manager came and apologized for the whole situation. We didn't see any reason why our pizza took so long to be served as we where the only ones in the restaurant. I don't recommend this location, very bad customer service
5;I live in the area and often eat here. But recently they have changed management and staff and have to say I am incredibly disappointed with the service.The new manager is some young guy who's ego is way bigger than it should be. and the server had a bad attitude and didn't do a good at replenishing drinks or cleaning tables. Went for the lunch buffet  when it first started and there was no selection. All pizza was old and cold. Very very disappointing.
6;Pizza Hut hung up on me. I wanted a Big Mac with a side of krabby patty but they said no because you are a...
7;Worst Pizza Hut. Not many people working in this location. Order takes forever, pizza came out cold. Toppings were sparsely placed. Definitely not recommended.
8;Definitely one of the WORST restaurants I have ever been to. OK so I came for the lunch buffet. The food was cold and dry and no new food came out for 15 minutes. The floor was dirty and our table was dirty with pizza sauce on it. When my drink was served to me there were particles floating around in it. There was a waiter of Asian descent working that day that was picking up food from the floor with his bare hands in front of customers, VERY BIG TURN OFF! Not the best customer service skills either. They seemed very understaffed. Further more that location is very old and dated. Like when they changed the pizza hut logo it would have only made sense to updated the interior of the restaurants too. It looks likes its still stuck in the 70's. Booths were dirty and had visible sweat marks on them. This location can do much better overall with its service and presentation. The staff could be more diverse and professional.
9;Worst pizza, i order chicken lovers pizza and all i got was onion and hardly you see chicken pieces. paid 20 dollars for medium size and not worth even for 5 dollars. Cheap cheap, wonder why people order food from them.
10;Each time I come to this TH, there are consistent errors with my order. Today will be the last time I come to this location.  I ask for an english muffin breakfast sandwich to be toasted, it arrives cold and stale. I returned the sandwich to the counter for a properly toasted sandwich, the staff only toasts one slice of the sandwich. I tell them that is unacceptable as now i have one toasted side and one stale and cold side. Their solution is to microwave the entire sandwich. Seriously??  The amount of time spent trying to get a toasted sandwich was rather assinine. This happens all too often here. Save yourself the trouble and visit the TH on Hwy7 and Markham Rd.
11;One of the worst customer service, no one serves me for good 5 mins, I have to repeat my order 3x then missing the soup of my order and won't admit it
12;They changed their name to yummy wok. Same unpleasant staff, same unappetizing food.. and they didn't give me sweet n sour sauce for my s&s balls I want to vomit, now I know what a cheater feels like, I'm sorry mandarin, it feels like I have an sti in my gut...If I ever spoke poorly of any other restaurant add an extra start to their rating... I'm contemplating of inducing vomiting but chemical help line says you should never do that... Rip maxPS I tossed most of the dish out.. sorry for wasting food..
13;Minimalist Chinese Take-out with a few Tables for nearby students during their Lunch-break.  Minimal as in barely any selection of clean-looking plastic forks, spoons, or knifes.No paper napkin(singular) offered or appear anywhere. Minimal as in they don't even have a garbage bin.  No Ice Tea available for the student ordering.  No Rootbeer and I had to settle for C-plus.The less than friendly Chinese Lady working the counter seemed to imitate Bobby Lee(MadTV) as he imitates a Chinese Lady.  Short, to-the-point, no-nonsense, high-pitched, order-and-get out-of-my-sight type.Complete de-ja-vu because it's identical to another place I visit once in awhile but unlike the students that visits August Moon, I do have a choice.  This place makes me wonder why Jamie Oliver isn't around this neighbourhood promoting his efforts.How identical you ask?  I'm not even going to write out the Menu or the Food.  Look at my other review and you'll know exactly.Maple Dragon:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz/maple-dragon-chinese
14;Worst service I've ever received. Called in to order, was told 40 minutes...an hour later I call to ask if it's on its way. He responds saying very soon sorry. I wait another 30 minutes when i call again to say it's been an hour and a half and I was told 40 minutes, may I ask why it's taking this long? Again he responds saying soon sorry and hangs up.After two calls, and 20 more minutes (totalling 1h 50min) it's delivered. Excited to finally have my food, after somewhat losing my appetite because of the service. My rice is split with my sweet and sour chicken, to which I paid full price to have each in their own containers. Ordering for a family of 4 that barley fed 2 people. Also, the food was cold. Why on earth would someone pay $40 for this kind of experience?I've never called to complain to a business. I call and instead of the woman providing me with any kind of solution to my half delivered, cold order... She tells me "Sorry too busy call you later" and goes to the other line. I've never come acro
15;Worst service I've ever seen. Slow half the time orders are wrong. Not polite at all. Floors are sticky in the entire store.  Was back in the store February 23 the person I was with had to wait 15 minutes for her food after she ordered before me and 3 other people. Everyone got their food before her and they ran out of popcorn chicken. When they finally made the chicken they gave it to people other then the one waiting the longest. I've never seen such incompetence.
16;Terribly painfully slow!! Plus got my order wrong totally confused staff!! Where is the manager??
17;EXTREMELY BAD SERVICE! I ordered online and made a call at 40 minutes because the food is supposed to be here. A lady picked up and said the delivery guy is on his way. Waited another 30 mins and the food is still not here. I had to cancel the order with disappointment and the lady was very rude. No apology and just hung up the phone. Don't eat here
18;Had a Combo Plate and Lunch Plate between two of us.  Tasted a little off but we thought really nothing of it.  A couple hours later we both got the runs and a twisting knot in our stomachs and a crappy after taste in our throats.  But, it didn't stay down through the evening.Had food poisoning before from Seaspray Chinese and this was the same,  Be careful what you order from Kingston Chinese.Kinda had it with Chinese places in this Area, FOOD is WAY TOO SKETCHY and a high risk of TOMEIN Sickness.
19;I have order 3 times from this place. 1st time when they first opened was ok. Had the usually chicken balls, egg rolls, fried rice and wonton soup. 2nd time was worse, same food, lesser quality. 3rd time, tried different food, BBQ ribs tasted like dog, veg chow mein was unflavored and filled with gelatin, wonton soup had a broken lid, that leaked into the bag. Each time I bought the soup, it was of lesser quality. Store looked clean I guess. Their light switch was gross. Don't waste you time with this place. Safe your money for Feathers, The Green Dragon or The Beech Tree. I think I feel sick.
20;This is the cheapest Chinese restaurant I have ever go to ! I order a general toe chicken and rice. $5.99 plus tax with a drink. Open the box it has 3 piece of chicken. Thin slice!!! This is a joke! I didn't bother to say anything.
21;This joint is as expensive and yucky as any Chinese place you'd find at a mall's food court.  You get a huge quantity of very poor quality and tasteless junk.  For the same cost, you might as well walk 100 metres east and get a great meal at Tropical Thai.  Don't make a mistake and eat here.  Run away - fast!
22;Found the fried rice greasy and the BBQ pork really dry and tough.Sea Spray down towards Main is much preferred for Canadian style Chinese.
23;I wish I can leave ZERO stars. The service is horrible and food is bland. the only good thing here is the fresh fruit, I'm sure you can pick that up at your neighborhood supermarket.
24;Informed my server of my dietary restrictions (dairy) and requested that my eggs not be made with milk.  They were and I had an allergic reaction.  Will never visit Cora's again as a result
25;Sports bar my ass. We went into here to watch the raptors game and they didn't want to play the sound out loud for fear of offending customers. Don't go here if you want to watch an important game. The vibes are just off. The service was slow and when we walked in she was on her cell phone. And we stood there forever. Also the food was so bad. Don't get the poutine. We tried it out. Never again.
26;A different experience each time I go. The only pro about this place is that they let you play your own music and you have a dance floor. However, the service SUCKS! They have one bartender serving everyone and they don't make food past 9pm. In two visits, we were told they don't have food. Also, during yesterday's visit, the speaker to play music was broken.. So we basically had super slow service, no food, and no music.. Just to get 2 shots took about 20 minutes and the place had our small group and 2 other people sitting at the bar.
27;No...I've had it with this place. I refuse to go back. Management changed sometime last year and this place took a HUGE dive...worse than before.There is ONE waitress who works the entire restaurant. The service is hugely lacking as a result.Last time I went, they had half price appetizers. We were told that they couldn't separate the bill and she brought us one large bill....oh, but SHE couldn't subtract the half price from our apps, because she needed the manager, who wasn't there to do it. So she found DIFFERENT items, that were the same cost as the half price items we got and made the bill with them....well how in hell are we supposed to divide up our bill, based on items we didn't order????!? It was actually shockingly stupid. We all guessed as best we could and threw in cash...I for one threw in the towel too. The food continues to be subpar at best, the prices are not great, even with half price and the service is horrendously terrible. This place is a waste of time and money.
28;Do not go there.  The management changed in 2013, and since then all new management seems to do is try to scam patrons and start fights with them.  The new owners husband tried to take a swing at me when I said they overcharged me.
29;This tim hortons is the worst I've ever been to. First things first, I took the time to walk there. I ordered a steeped tea only to get a coffee instead. And then ordered timbits only to find out they were stale. So I ended up walking back and switching the coffee to the tea... and got a refund for the timbits. No hassles.But when I brought the tea back, I was told there was too much milk and the tea tasted like it wasn't fresh. Never again will I go to this tim hortons.
30;I was ignored by the cashier for over five minutes, she was talking to one of her friends and made eye contact with me multiple times.  She made no move to serve me, just ignored me. I was told when I was finally served that they had no timbits, of any type, available. They also had no soup. I got a toasted bagel that wasn't even toasted. Tim's is the only place within walking distance from work. Their customer service is horrible.
31;Villa Madina uses the same space as the Thai express which I eat at frequently. Today I felt like a Greek/Mediterranean salad with chicken and remembered it was there. This place offers up heaping plates of food for the $8-10 mark. Plates consist of rice, salad and potato and your protein as per any prototypical Mediterranean restaurant but all I want is salad and protein (in my mind I think this shouldn't be a problem). Well low and behold if I want a salad and chicken I need to buy the salad package $9 and have to add chicken $3.50. Now I get potato and rice are starches and are much cheaper than fresh greens and their like but why I couldn't have a salad with chicken at the same price point as any of their other dishes was beyond me. They had a 2 skewer meal that was $11. if I had wanted my salad with two skewers I would have had to pay $16. I'm sorry half a salad is not worth the extra $5. When I questioned their logic I am advised  "in this day and age you always have to pay more". Thanks but no thanks. 
32;Ordered big crunch and poutine, get home it was a original and heavily watered gravy. Disgusting, rip off!!! Stay away!
33;Can you believe that they recently JACKED their delivery charge to FIVE BUCKS ! - so when you add tax on delivery, and a tip, you are adding ten bucks to an often AWFUL MEAL.
34;Not coming back. After seeing how the owner Becky treats her employees, i will not support her business
35;I went today to get the Noodles and beef special. The noodles were stale, like they sat there for days, the meat was tough. The person that served me used her bare hands to put some peppers on the meat, I told her no peppers please!!!I think the management changed and the food got much worse. Also I took a fork and the cashier said that I already gave you one. No tact, bad and not clean!
36;I agree with the other not-so-positive review here! The food used to be much better. Now, there is new management and they are beyond CHEAP!!! I saw the lady behind the counter pick up pickles with her glove-less hands and put them in a container! Can you say "hepatitis" anyone? Also, the same lady yelled at a boy for daring to take a napkin. He told her he was a daily customer and she just glared at him! Are the napkins coming out of her paycheque? Really disgusting and gross place! Will never go back. AVOID!!!!!!!!!!!!
37;I really wish I had something nice to say about this location and the pizza I just wasted $20.00 on...but I am speechless!The location is set in the middle of many other small restaurants (hey noodle) etc, making it a busy parking lot filled with dawdling drivers who r too busy talking and unable to concentrate on their parking skills. I should start by saying I am not a huge fan of pre-made pizza crust and sub-par pizza sauces...,however I did try a slice of Pizza Hut from a Kipling location last night and it tasted / looked incredible. This fiasco of a pizza I just bought was greasy with a soggy cooked on one side crust - and their version of the  the cheesy crust was an oozing mess of cheese-less oily bits of goop where the crust should be. I feel sick just recounting the horror of this thing. Ignoring the hideousness of this so called pizza - I ventured in to try it ....2 slices and 4 greasy crust-bits later, I have a stomach ache and the thought of ever eating pizza again makes me want to go fHU
38;WARNING!!! Stay clear of this location if you want quality food and service,  they burn the food and ban you from receiving deliveries if you talk back to the driver when he swears at you. Very rude poor service best to find another location or order somewhere else.  Management should be ashamed of the customer relationships and needs to take some courses in Research and Development. THE CUSTOMERS PAY YOUR BILLS GET A CLUE!!!
39;We like eating pizza but what we got from this place was not pizza.  The pizza had a disgusting flavour and bread sticks weren't puffy and there wasn't any parmesan topping on them.  The employee was rude and thought she was the best thing to happen to pizza since pepperoni. I would not suggest eating at this restaurant of you're human.  My dog was ok with it but even he didn't feel right after.
40;They deserve less than one star. The only good was the fries had a great seasoning and the huge selection of wing flavours.The "hot" wings really weren't although I understand that's relative. My fish and chips was the worst I've had. It was overcooked and so dry that I think the last quarter would make a suitable hammer. The waitress barely looked at us again once she heard "Groupon" and we ended up leaving early since she hadn't come around in 20 minutes so we could get more drinks. Also who in the world served fish and chips and didn't have any tartar sauce (and barely knows what tartar sauce is). I know it's a wing place but don't put it on the menu if you're not sure what it is.
41;Wish I can give them negative scores.They randomly make up rules on when and how you use the goupon.  Went there with three people using the groupon "$50 Groupon toward lunch or dinner for 4" and they wouldn't accept it...Even though I had done it in the past. When asked about it, she said it was in the fine print somewhere... When it clearly states it nowhere!!  Horrible customer service, the lady even yelled something along the lines of cheap get cheap service, when we were leaving.  When it was a standard 15% tip for sub-par service.. which included messing up our order 2x/ long wait/ justifying the random rules on the groupon. This will be the last and final time I go there.  The food isn't worth paying full price.But wait, there's more!! This ground is not even the $20 or $50... they ended up subtracting taxes off the groupon's value.  So the $20 value groupon we bought was onlu worth $17.40.
42;They over serve their customers alcohol and when they crash their car into yours, the owner won't help you get a license plate number off their security cameras.
43;This place is gross. It's like a health and food inspector's nightmare. The pizza looks like it was baked five years ago and made of melted plastic, which prompted us to try the biryani, which looked a bit better.Fast-forward eight hours later, and we both have severe food poisoning. Also while we were there they refused to make change for this girl, and I'm pretty sure it was just cuz she was black.
44;This place really is gross. I've seen with my own eyes rats come out their stove and go back in, like they're playing! And the woman there is standing by the window with her whole hand in her mouth. Complete disregard for cleanliness.
45;Wanted to try their noodles for lunch today, but they were closed. Lights out at around 12:10pm. Came by about an hour later, lights on with people inside, but doors locked. Very odd that they weren't open for lunch without even a note to indicate why and when they'd be open again. I also noticed that the Chinese name has changed. Not sure if I want to try to see if they're open when I'm around the neighbourhood.I'll amend my 1-star when I'm able to get in the next time. For now, it's worth the 1-star given the annoyance.
46;Just paid $6.99 for store brought dumplings, taste exactly like the ones I got from T&T. So disappointed! My bf ordered the wonton soup, the soup has no flavor, the wonton is bad quality and probably had no meat in it. The only good thing was the fried tofu side dish we got, at least it tasted fresh. Never coming back again.... Might as well just make my own.
47;This was my first and also the last visit of this place. I was disappointed by the service and the food. The waitress wasn't friendly at all. I ordered breakfast menu, but every part of it had something I didn't like - potatoes were undercooked, eggs too greasy and undercooked and sausages burned. Also the water tasted strange. Sirup provided to pancakes was so watery, that I suspect they mixed it with water to reduce costs. With the price for breakfast similar to the restaurant across the street, it is not worth to come here.
48;We had a horrendous experience just parking in front of this establishment!  The owner/chef came running out screaming at the top of his lungs like some hysterical animal - because we misparked.  This is an abusive person and stay away - especially if you are a woman!
49;The old man who works there is pissed off every day. Yells at customers. Throws the food about.  He's so rude! Why is he allowed to work with customers ?? If you don't like what you are doing then leave the job!
50;First let me reiterate that I love Greek food. I had a craving for some chicken soulvaki and noticed there was a Jimmy the Greek in the food court of the Sheppard Center.  I ordered the chicken soulvaki dinner. The older man serving me asked if I wanted some tazziki with my dinner.  So naturally I said yes, thinking I would get a small serving of tazziki. But instead apparently he thought I wanted some chicken with my tazziki, because he walloped my entire plate with it. The chicken was extremely salty, and the rice was pretty much mush. This was the worst food I have had in quite some time.  Needless to say I have crossed this off my list of go to places.
51;Today I was at the Sheppard Centre location and asked for a  gyro with salad. The person in charge (a male over 50 years old) was very rude. At first I didn't understand what he was saying because of this accent, but I asked him to repeat what he was saying a few times and I think he didn't like that. Regardless, not being a native speaker myself I understand the frustration, so I continued and asked politely my order. He then started heating the bread on the flames and even when the tongs were next to him we used his hand (no gloves) to flip the bread at least 3 times. He then proceeded to serve everything, and again, with his hands and without using gloves he closed the wrap and proceeded to cash out my order (He has about to open the drawer and take the money with the same hands he was managing food). I asked him if he sanitized his hands and said I noticed he wasn't using any gloves. He didn't understand me so after a few times when he understood he said "I didn't touch your food" I replied "yes, you did"
52;About as authentic as KFC is to Southern Cooking. The Shawarma is dry due to being pre cut so early in the day.  Bland and tasteless.  Also had to return it for more toasting.  The press was barely on.  Left it on for quite a well and still wasn't long enough. Service was non existent and had to yell for someone to attend the counter.  Everyone commenting about this place is right.  It's not good.
53;the chicken shawarma was dried out and tasted like it may be from the day before. the kofta was very dry as well...very disappointed, the best part was the pizza I ordered for my daughter...won't be eating here again. $40.00 wasted... next time showtime bistro for me!
54;In all honestly, this is probably my fault.  I ordered a tabbouleh salad and once I realised that the staff member couldn't even find it and spent minutes finding someone to help him locate it, I should have walked away from ordering it.  Service was extremely slow and inefficient, the portion size was small, and it was very mediocre.  If you enjoy eating gritty little bits in your $9 dollar small sized salad, you should check this place out.
55;Extremely slow and painful Sevice. Not like other paramount restaurants across GTA. The food took a long time to come and fries seemed to be from yesterday. This place seems to be more focused on takeaway than the restaurant.
56;I would like to start off by saying that I have never written a review before this one, I have used yelp many times to decide where to eat, but I have never been moved to write a review of my own. My awful experience at this location has prompted me to signup for a Yelp account just so I can share it.  I have been to many Paramount locations, and I really like their food and service, generally speaking. My experience at other locations has always been good.  That's why when they first opened this location I was so excited because it was close to my house. The first time we went there I was not impressed by the food or the service, but I figured they had just opened and they still needed to iron out the problems. I decided to give it another shot and went there yesterday with my family. The service was mediocre and the food was awful. To make it short, we were given cold bread to start, the waitresses kept coming to our table with other people's orders,  and the food was horrible and cold. I personally ordered
57;This place is very mediocre. The service is slow and after eating a lot of time middle easter food, I think that I'm very disappointed with the quality and the flavor of this dishes. The meat of the shawarma was dry and flavorless and the falafel hasn't all the traditional ingredientes. Just falafel and lettuce. It is overpriced.  it isn't worth it. My best advice is to skip this awful place.
58;I just ordered a salad bowl and it was horrible. The staff started off asking if I wanted rice and beans, then moved next to protein, which I chose the mild chicken that she suggested. Next was onto the toppings of tomato, lettuce, corn and etc. After she was done with the toppings, she moved onto the salsa and sour cream.... And that's pretty much it for this "salad"! It's not like the Chipotle salad bowl that I'm used to, where it consisted of an actual bed of salad.. But here you simply get a little bit of shredded lettuce. I asked for more lettuce and rice which she was happy to provide more. The taste of the salad itself wasn't all that bad BUT the chicken was absolutely disgusting. It didn't even taste like chicken. I thought it was some sort of chicken substitute. It's not 100% chicken meat and I will 100% never eat there again!
59;VERY unimpressed!!! Both their website and door signage indicate they close at midnight on Saturday evenings. Drove there at 11 pm as I was starving and craving a burrito and it was the closest one to home still open (and pregnancy cravings are no joke!) AND THEY WERE CLOSED. Not cool. Now I'm hangry. Very hangry...
60;The tortilla was disgusting, my burrito was soggy,  the dude didn't seem like he knew how to make a burrito,  and the beans were cold.  Never going back here again!
61;This place is a complete joke.  My burrito had one spoon of cheese.  They hire kids who don't know how to count change.  I gave him $5.75 for a $5.65 burrito and he supposed to give me back $0.10.  He goes "You still owe me another quarter".  WTF.  I told him that I gave you $5.75 look closely.  Duh!.I asked for burrito sauce, they go "we don't have any".  Tasted so plain :(  The hot sauce isn't even that hot.  It lacks the real burrito ingrediants, such as fried onions and green peppers.  Their just imitating the concept of a burrito without the skills and ingredients of how to make one.  I can imagine their profit margins are very thin and I don't expect them to survive this a tough competitive market.
62;Very low key burritos. They are pretty stingy on the toppings. Plus bathroom didn't have soap to wash hands in. Really really stingy. I ordered the veggie burrito, the cheese and toppings were so little that all i was able to taste was the tortilla...disappointed because i know i have had better burritos.
63;If you're looking for a burrito. Do NOT go there.  Nothing fresh or authentic about this place. With tsp size servings in a giant wrap. Which by the way are frozen a defrosted. There meat comes out of packaged frozen bags.  Even at $5 special.  Huge disappointment.  One try was to many. Horrible
64;Worst quesadilla ever!  When you think of a quesadilla you think cheesy goodness with fresh ingredients... This had LITERALLY one spoon of cheese and this saucy meat that puddled in my plate and made the whole thing a big soggy mess!  Granted the veggies were fresh, the kid who made it had no idea what a quesadilla was (management should maybe offer more training into the meals their staff are responsible to make?). Also more than half my quesadilla had nothing on it... It was just plain tortilla (that should clue you in to add more cheese!).  It's really hard to mess up Mexican food but Burrito Zone beat the odds and failed.  If you can tell by my post.. I was terribly disappointed with my meal.
65;I had the worst experience today!!! It took 3 phone calls with their incompetent staff to place an order for delivery (they kept hanging up even before I could give my address) One hour later, I call back and they told me that my order was CANCELLED! They made excuses for their own mistake and I never even got an apology. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
66;When I saw that a burrito place moved into town, I got super excited. I think this might be the first one I've seen near me. However, the excitement didn't last long. I saw past bad reviews before I came but I decided to see for myself. I ordered a chicken burrito with guac. It's not horrible, it's just not good. The flavour lacks, it was cold despite putting it on the press, and the ingredients seemed to be laid out sloppily during the ordering. I really wanted to like this place because I love burritos and it would have been a convenient location for me to get one. The service was relatively friendly - cashier, maybe the owner, was super nice, and the environment is modern. If they step up their burrito-making game, get their flavours down right, and heat up their burritos nicely, I'd go again. But for now, I'll drive a bit more for a good bite.
67;Food has not met expectations at all. In store didn't taste good, Uber Eats was cold and didn't taste good. Would definitely not recommend at all, not even if you were dying. Get & Go burrito all the way!
68;Nasty place - the veggies are brown and rotting in the trays, the 'large' burrito is at best a snack size, the 'extreme nachos' include a steak-like substance (as if Arby's did something that tried to resemble carne asada) with a texture like rubber and the colour of that tennis ball the dog chewed the green fuzzy part off and buried in the backyard for the last 5 years, that is coated in a horrid bbq style sauce (wot?!?), no decent drink options other than beer (People: Jarritos?  Izze? Anything but bottled industrial pop, please)Oh, and over the house system is ethnic music while gangsta rap is being cranked on the teevees.Must say, the pork wasn't horrid (and the only plus is that unlike Mucho Burrito, they knew that carnitas was pork!), and they have Cholula.But those two points are not enough to save them.Can't believe I'd find a place worse than Mucho Burrito, but there ya go - setting the barre lower!  Kudos!
69;Totally nasty experience. Will be surprised if they last.Ordered 1 4 taco meal, 1 taco meal, a chicken quesadilla and nachos with cheese.The liquid cheese on the nachos is nasty (clumpy).The Taco Beef is pasty (doesn't even taste like beef). Taco beef also had no gravy, sauce or seasoning.This was the worst experience ever. Pretty bad when Taco Bell beats this place hands down....Won't be back here for sure.
70;Had dinner here. Staff is extremely slow. At the busiest time they only had one guy working. Feels like they don't speak English and have a terrible attitude. Waited almost 30 minutes in line. When it came to paying, the man couldn't figure out how much change he was giving me. That took another 10 minutes... Only to figure out that he gave me the wrong change. Also got nachos which were cold and I'm pretty sure my beef was microwaved. Waited way too long for bad food!
71;Well I'm at a hotel 8km away and ordered food 35 min ago. Waiting for my food to arrive and I get a call saying that my area is out of there range. Our hotel is 15min away Google maps say. Would not suggest trying to order deliver from here.
72;Tried this "Mexican" restaurant recently, but it was terrible. Probably the worst burrito location I've been to. I'm surprised that they are still open to be honest.The staff was friendly, but the food was just not good. I ended up just throwing out my food.
73;Horrible service. I don't get what's the point of having a website that accepts online orders for in store pick up when you guys don't even do online orders during your busy hours?Today I made an order for burrito's for a few other's at the same time at around 11:40am. I selected cash as my payment and to be picked up at this location. I show up around 12-12:05pm and waited till 12:10 for someone to actually ask me what's up, and they told me they do not ACCEPT any online order's during this time. and I'm like Waht's the points. Instead they wanted me to order on the spot instead, but I was furious and said cancel that order or don't even bother processing it later today when you guys actually accept online order, as it's pointless. I left and went next door instead. If I wanted to wait for a burrito, I would have came in with my friend's to order it rather then order it online. So waste of time.I can tell you, the competitor's like Burrito Boyz, etc even take phone orders at ALL times of day regardless. 
74;The bbq ribs I ordered barely had any meat on them. The pork fried rice tasted very bland and hardly had any pork in them. I paid 10 bucks for the dinner special and the food I got was worth 5 bucks tops. 1 star. Would've given it 2 but the tap option didn't even work on their debit machine. Your best bet if you're in the area and want chinese food is to go elsewhere. Don't waste your money at this dump like I did.
75;I wish I could give this place 0 stars. This was the worst Chinese take out I've ever had. I had to throw away everything nothing was edible!! Do yourself a favour and stay away
76;This place is crap!  Not that I am a Chinese food expert but I have had my share in my lifetime and this places takes the cake for dead last.  Only thing that resembled what it's supposed to taste like was the deep fried wontons.  I highly recommend you find an alternative for Chineese food.
77;This place is a disgrace and I'm amazed how it's still in business. We ordered knowing that the reviews were bad but figured they were from uptight yelpers with super high standards and couldnt be that bad. You can buy better chinese food from the freezer at the grocery store. The food was barely edible and a total waste of $45. 0 stars.
78;THE WORST Chinese food I have ever tasted. Beef was rubbery. Veggies consisted of wilted onions. Service was awful. No idea how this place is in business.
79;Holy hell!!! Is there ANY decent Chinese food in Toronto? Take me back to basic, cheap US Chinese food. This place is straight putrid! Only edible item in our $40 order was the fried rice. The wontons were especially suspect. $6 for a box of greasy old triangles...some of which had a microscopic bit of "meat???" In them. The dipping sauce was a congealed red blob. The hot and sour soup was opaque bright orange....again lumps of congealed....something..???...in it. Could not eat. Everything else was crazy bland...including the human beef supposedly their specialty.For real, I give up on your Chinese food Canada.
80;Dreadful Tim Horton's, I asked for a toasted bagel with cream cheese and received one that was black, drenched in butter. Disgusting! My advice: go to the Wendy's and order yourself a sour cream and chives baked potato, $2 and they're amazing!
81;I go out of my way to visit other Tim locations....I dreadfully pass by this one on my way to the doctors so I usually end up ordering.This location always messes up my drink orders. My iced cap had no ice at all. It was just cool liquid. I was in a rush to the doctors so I didn't have time to go back. And then when my mom ordered last time, they used the table cloth to wipe the the edge of the rim when they overfilled it...The edge of the rim...where she was going to drink from...looks unsanitary. I would not have taken that drink had it been me. The only redemption is that they make a mean grilled cheese panini. If I know I have to pass by this location, I always bring my water bottle with me for my thirst needs now.
82;Can't believe I came here to eat. Had the 3 tacos and the food was stale and chicken tasted old. Went to complain and the people just answer me with an "oh is it?" I asked for a refund and was told manager wasn't on duty to give me a refund. Well they just lost my business completely as I work next door. This place shouldn't be allowed to operate with the expired food they serving.
83;Worse customer service and knowledges of their menu. They have a menu for kids and when I went with my son they won't let me buy from it unless I buy any regular menu which they should have said on the menu board and they don't care to return customer away
84;Bad experience. Employees smoking in front of the store while on their shift. Employees dont listen when they put your toppings. And fountain drinks are very very watery. I used to love this place but service is just terrible.
85;rude management and by far the worst mexican food ive ever tasted. absolutely flavourless. could barely tell the difference between the beef and the chicken. i would never eat there again and if i were mexican i would be offended that this place calls themselves mexican. i didn't even taste a hint of spice. not even black pepper! waste of money
86;Should of probably read these reviews before eating here. Spicy Chicken burrito had no flavour chicken had old dry bits of chicken in it. Family run and they don't help each other when there is a line. Brutal.
87;This is BY FAR the worst Tim's I've ever been to.I can't count the times where I've received my orders wrong in spectacular fashion. I don't know who is doing the hiring here, but the staff on a regular basis are unfriendly, slow, and forgetful.I only go to this location because of its proximity to my office but I swear if I win the lottery one day. I will buy a franchise to rival this location.Just at the sheer mention of this location in my office kicks off a long and complicated "Bitch-fest" (for lack of a better term) where we all complain when we've been wronged by the lack of service here. Am I being too harsh? Probably, but all I ask for is to get my order correctly (somewhat) consistently. I shouldn't be entering an engagement with this location with the expectation of a mix-up. That's all I'm asking.
88;Rumors are true :-( Horrible experience at Ajax location... Worse experience in my life at pizza restaurant...I took my parents there expecting to have a good time, but it was the opposite..!!! Starting with the drinks, NO orange pop at that place, then when i finally order we had to wait for about 40 mins to get the horrible cooked pizza..!!!Pizza wasn't even cook properly... Overcooked in the bottom and seems the stove is not getting the pizza cook in the inside... Awful experience...At the moment to deliver the pizza on our table, i immediately order the bill... 1 large pizza, 1 medium pizza and 4 drinks for 42 bucks... The price It sounds like right to me... But experience was horrible..!!Carpet dirty.. Not hot sauce on the table unless you want to pay extra... Employes only go to your table when you order and when you ask for the bill... They are more busy talking among them than attend the customers...Anyway, after eat that pizza... Told my patents to wait for me at the car while i pay the b
89;bad experience at this location time and time again. if you're willing to pay $20+ on 1 pizza with no toppings (hence, no flavour) on it, this is the place with you. even after advising the employee about my prior bad experience and asking for the pizza to be generously topped, i received a pizza with double the regular crust size and not enough cheese to even contain the sauce. if you want a decent pizza joint within ajax, try pizza depot or even pizza pizza (rossland). you get what you ask/pay for.
90;Visited this restaurant even after a bad experience ordering food. So surprised this is still open! Food was too greasy... Really dirty carpet... Server was nice though. If you're craving this kind of food just to to Boston pizza or something .... This is overpriced
91;I only order take out here since the dine in is horrible. Every time we go for it the servers take forever and never get things right (even when your the only customers in the entire dining room). It's better to cut your losses and take out the pizza, for some reason it comes out good that way lol
92;The worst worst worst!!!!! Takes forever to get food here. Haven't been to McDonald's in years and thought I would go here for some late night quick grab. Boy what a big mistake. Mark
93;Poor customer service,food sucks. Arrogant staff members and manager.
94;-1 'spardon the word vomitwe arrived at around 9pm and was seated almost immediately but then waited for a solid 10 mins before we were acknowledge by a server. The server then said you'll be helped by the bartender which was fine we were right next to the bar. The bartender comes over and slams the menus down and asks what would we like to drink? Didn't even get a chance to glance at the menu. We get our drink orders and food orders in and wait. He comes back with and slams dishes on the table along with our drinks. So from the start he was pretty rude. Didn't check-in until the end. Asked us if we would like our bill and we say yes. Can we please have separate bills? So the bartender says really? You're going to do this to me now? I couldn't help but say I can't tell if you're joking or not. He leaves and comes back with the debit machine and my sister who's been a server for x amount of years couldn't help but ask if he was serious about this comment. He replied with I was just trying to save time. At
95;Showed up with my family (4 of us) just as the host (a middle aged dude) was seating another couple. A larger group of 6 or 7 came in behind us. The host comes back and starts to seat them first!  I tried to get his attention (was literally waving at him - of course he saw me) but he ignored me on purpose. Absolute duck.  Of course we left immediately. The place smells disgusting (bleach) and is filled with low lifes anyways. I will never come back!
96;Words can't describe how bad our night here was.First of all, my steak came out looking exactly the same as the picture for the establishment -- but with the added bonus of having a broken bone with shards scattered through it.After we order our food and are seated they casually come back to tell us the draught system isn't working up to their standards and will only serve bottled beer instead.  But lucky for us, it's only $6 per bottle!  Fantastic!"All steaks served with Chuck's World Famous Fries!" Well let me end the suspense -- the only thing these Fries are world famous for is sucking huge balls.  Chuck must be the worlds biggest asshole because they are absolutely 100% frozen and served unseasoned, glistening with oilPretty much the first time I have EVER left less than 15% on a bill.  I think I was STILL too generousWalked to Maguires on foot as fast as we could get out of there, and have nothing bad left to say about the rest of the night.
97;I went with a group of people, about 15, we got seated pretty quick and waitress came around saying she'll be back in a couple so we could order drinks and food at the same time. She came back, we ordered but didn't get our drinks for probably 30 mins. We got two rounds of water before our beers, she came back to the table saying I ran out of pitchers so she had to take the water away. We then found out there's no bartender and the waitress had to get your drinks. The food came out really slow, it was alright, nothing special about it at all, my boyfriend and I ordered pound wings each and was still hungry after it. Everyone at our table said the wings did not fill them at all. The only good part was it was cheap! Down side was that it's not the nicest place to go, there was a bike gang there so everyone was scared to use the washrooms until they left, there wasn't one family there, just a bunch of guys and couples.
98;I usually won't leave a review unless it is a nice one but I cannot help it with this place!  The food is awful, it really is. Everything is box, canned or previously frozen and the rib steak should be called gristle steak.  Even after the staff replaced my meat for chicken I couldn't eat it because it was processed to the max. Right down to the salad and sautéed mushrooms it's all bad!
99;This subway is the WORST subway I've ever been to. I commuted to UTM ( University of Toronto in Mississauga) for 4 years, and I would find myself stopping in to this subway regularly as it was on the way.There was a day when I walked in with my girlfriend, and ordered breakfast sandwiches. As we began to eat, my girlfriend noticed a LARGE FRUIT FLY in her meal. As a loyal customer, I expected the OWNER, who made our subs and who I got to know well over the years, to atleast apologize. He did not apologize. Instead he made up some bogus excuse as to why the fly was found in the sub. After downplaying the situation, he didn't even offer to remake it! This guy is so dam CHEAP. I can't believe to think how much he cheats out on the quality. Ive filed a report with subway in this issue.I've spent thousands at this location. Not a penny more going forward from that day. Also I make an effort to tell people about this awful experience.
100;Honest truth!!! FYI! All across ontario subway restaurants still have chemical compound aka: ADA found in all the bread. such as  -- nine grain wheat, nine grain honey oat, Italian white, Italian Herbs and Cheese, Parmesan Oregano, Roasted Garlic, Sourdough and Monterrey Cheddar breads, to be precise.If one makes the choice to eat at subway Flat bread is best sure way for alternative safe to eat. Enough said there's way to much chemicals in everday food we encounter fast food including groceries. Highly not recommend many wise food choices available elsewhere.
101;we tried groupon. just me & my fiancé. terrible, sorry to say. we waited a long time for the appetizer, then after we FINISHED the appetizer, we waited an HOUR to get the main course. by then, we weren't all that hungry. but clearly, not every1 has to wait to long.the group of 4 that came in well after us FINISHED their appetizer, & entire meal by the time my group of 2 even got the meal. we must have sat there over 2 hours.lamb dish was tasty, the rest... meh... but I was burping up acid for hours afterwards, & I never get that. place was freezing, I sat in my jacket most of the night.then they got order wrong. bathrooms were filthy. (it was only men working there, so gotta wonder hygienic conditions in kitchen, too)little cup of chai tea was $4, I think that's ridiculous. small little cup of tea.then, to add insult to injury, after really shoddy service, they added 15% gratuity to the bill. some restaurants do this. but they always tell you ahead of time or its on the menu. they can't just add thin
102;Bought a groupon and had dinner there on a saturday.  The waiters were initially pleasant and kind.  Food arrived and was a big disappointment. The fish and prawn dish for $18.95 only had 2 medium sized shrimp and a paltry portion of very cheap BASSA filet!The sauce it came with was good.The naan bread and rice is very expensive ($5.75 or $4.25) and it adds to the cost of the main dish significantly. The braised lamb was a bit tough (pre cooked not fresh).  The korma sauce was good.The only plus was the naan bread was hot and fresh and the sauces for the fish/prawn and lamb were fantastic.Then the big surprise came when i saw the bill included a 15% gratuity.  I politely explained that tips are always at the discretion of the customer and it is mostly  based on quality of service.  He disagreed and became rude and said to me if you use a coupon you MUST pay a high tip!  I told him even if you wrote in a $20 tip i would simply not pay it.  I decided to leave him a 10% tip and pay cash.  They yelled at
103;Another dismal Groupon experience. We felt ripped off at every turn. I knew we were going to be in for an eventful evening when we arrived. No one was at the front desk to greet you or see you to your seat. Usually you see happy people in a restaurant no one was smiling here. It took a long time to bring us our food. There were only 2 guys working the whole restaurant. I was ready to leave but my wife was still sipping her $12 glass of wine. They also did a bait and switch on the menu. The prices you see are not the prices you get. Some things are way more. The naan is nearly twice as much as advertised.  You have to pay for rice.  Finally, when we got our bill, a huge tip was added in. Despite the poor service or should I say lack of service that we received, I paid by bill in full. The waiters never smiled once and never visited the table to see how things were going. In a nutshell, ended up paying over $50 (2 people) in total for average Indian food in a sub-par restaurant with pathetic service. Save your
104;We had the worst possible experience at the Indian Bread Bar. We had bought a groupon and was excited to check this place out but was hugely disappointed. We went for dinner on July 18,2015. The server was very rude and abusive. It has horrible customer service which I did not expect from this place.The prices are exorbitant and the food was awful. The naans(bread) were burnt and hardly edible. I would NOT recommend this place. It was a horrible experience. Be prepared to be abused if you ever happen to check out to place. AVOID Indian Bread Bar at all cost.
105;Wish I had read the reviews before I bought the Groupon. Food was just okay. We ordered steak biriyani, butter chicken, and two garlic naan. The waiter made us order $40 before taxes and charged us 18% tip. He tried to overcharge us but changed it when I confronted him. Don't understand this kind of business attitude.Save yourself your money and the trouble of coming here. Better off eating at McDonalds.
106;Indifferent waiter, avg food and a menu with two different prices.This place is very shaddy, during our dinning experience we noticed people continually complaining about there bill. Sure enough when we got our bill everything was either 10 or 40% more  expensive. When we asked about  this they played stupid until i pulled out my smart phone and showed them there online prices. The waiter then replied thats their take out price.When i went outside my friends and i were disusing this and a passerby overheard us and told us this place has a reputation in the neighborhood. Apparently, they have been scamming people for a while now with this dubious trick. The passerby told me this restaurant use to be associated with Amaya, however, Amaya had too many complaints about them scamming people that they disassociated themselves with this location.
107;Warning! Do NOT buy a Groupon for Indian Bread Bar!Groupon continues to sell vouchers for Indian Bread Bar but they are closed and clearly out of business!!!I bought a voucher a few months ago and went to Indian Bread Bar to use it 4, yes, FOUR times in the past 2 weeks and every time I got there they were closed, even though the hours on their website and posted on their front door showed they should have been open! If you call their number it goes directly to a machine that says the voice mailbox is full.  If you try to reserve through their link to Open Table it always says the restaurant is offline - even during their posted "open hours".Every time I email Groupon to say I tried to redeem my voucher but the restaurant was closed, they send me a stupid email with the hours posted on the website!!! I tell them I can't reach the restaurant by phone and they tell me to email!!??Of course when I tried to email the restaurant I received no reply - what a surprise, clearly they are out of business!
108;I bought $ 20.00 Groupon for this Indian Bread Bar and went for dinner, it was simplya disaster experience,. First we checked the Menu online very different Menu from the restaurant Menu. Price for each dish almost a dollar more then they quoted on online Menu. Here is an example:We ordered: Veg. Pakoros, online menu price $ 6.95, in restaurant menu $ 7.25Chicken Tikka Masala, online menu price $ 13.95, in restaurant menu $ 14.95Saag Paneer, online menu price $ 11.95, in restaurant menu $ 12.95 Garlic Naan online menu price $ 2.50, in restaurant menu $ 3.95Plain Naan online Menu price $ 1.95, in restaurant menu $ 2.95They charged us in restaurant price, even though they have total different prices online, we looked at a Onion Bhaji's for $ 4.95, online menu, in restaurant menu this item is not there. The veg. pakoros they gave was just awaful.I was totally shocked to see they helped themselves with a gratuity of 17%The food taste very salty and everything was done in tomatoe sauce.  I have to ag
109;We should have listened to the first reviewer, but we decided to give this place a chance. Worst mistake ever. It's very overpriced and the food is bad.The korma was awful, to the point I couldn't eat much of it. The curry was slightly better and since we were starving, we ate most of it. We felt a bit sick afterwards. The curries don't come with rice, you have to order it separately, it's 3.45 for a small portion.We ordered a curry and korma, 1 serving of rice and naan, and samosas. That alone amounted for over $55, and yeah they do tip themselves around 18%. Whether you have a coupon or not, it's still overpriced! We've been to many other Indian restaurants that had more reasonable prices, and far better tasting food.Also, the table we were seated at was very small for us. There were many other vacant tables and we asked if we could be moved. The server said no, so we assumed they were reserved or they get really busy. However, for the whole duration we were there, not a single table was taken. Even i
110;I wish there was a lower star rating for this place. Saying this place has piss poor service does a disservice to piss. They brought the wrong dish then, after I pointed it out and waited 20 mins, they brought the right one...but charged me for both and refused to adjust the bill accordingly. The server was abusive about the whole ordeal...and when I decided he deserved no tip because of his jerk attitude and lengthy service delays, it nearly led to a physical altercation. I would recommend this place to my worst enemies or anyone who enjoys decent food in a fairly run down, dirty dive with staff who shouldn't be in the service industry.
111;I placed my order at the drive thru and from the time I paid until the time I reached the pick up window it was 10 minutes. Even when I got to the pick up window, no one showed up for a good minute. When I reached inside the bag, the fries were cold. When I went in to the restaurant, they told me I could wait another 5 minutes to get a fresh order and that I had to understand that 3:45 is their rush hour. What that has to do with cold fries, I don't understand.  I got my money back, left and contacted McD's online. The response was "sorry we disappointed you, we are working on it, but go back and try again. Sorry, I am not here waste my time to test out whether you are improving or not. At least there is a Burger King around the corner. Too bad you can't give no stars.
112;I've been to this mcDonalds a million times but it's the first time I really want to say this hoping McDonald is reading. The manager is really nice but I think either the staff are trained badly or it's just a bad case of lord of the flies there. It's a Sunday morning, we used the kiosk to order and the receipt was jammed inside. I walked over to the counter and asked the first person to help me, to which she responded " yeah the machine is jammed so you don't get a receipt but I will get your food". I tried twice to explain to her that I could see my receipt in the slot but she just kept giving me the same respond. A second person (some teenager with a frown clearing showing how much she didn't want to be there) chimed in with "ma'm that is not your receipt, there is no receipt and we can't print another one for you"        . What she meant was "it's just a stupid receipt and stop asking us". I already know it's not true because this happened before and I got one re printed. Frankly I really didn't care
113;You know what really annoys me (I was going to use a different word) when they clearly state that the dining room is 24 hours along with the drive thru but they have the door locked. And this isn't the first time I've been here and it's been locked after midnight. It really angers me that I can't go in and buy some food after midnight and I can't walk through the drive thru (I don't drive or own a car). I really want some nuggets right now but can't get any and this is the closest McDonald's to me and they're closed. Don't they know that the dining room is 24 hours as well. Seriously this is a serious problem with this McDonald's. It's almost as bad as when the McDonald's was in the middle of the parking lot with roaches and a dank gross out underground play area. There are standards and this McDonald's constantly falls short. Slow service (I've stood in this McDonald's and waited up to 10 minutes to be served), locked doors after midnight. If it wasn't the only one within walking distance I would seriously 
114;The first sign of things to come.was the incredibly sticky floor. I almost pulled my hip out of its socket, unstinking my foot, after standing in one spot too long. I ordered the Ma Po Tofu, which took a fairly long time to prepare, especially considering there didn't seem to be any other customers or orders ahead of me. I took my order back to my office, I can't say my expectations were very hi, but, upon opening the container, I discovered it only contained Tofu and some sauce. For some reason I have always thought one of the key ingredients of the dish is ground pork. It's been in the dish whenever I have ordered it at numerous other restaurants around the city. My apologies if this is not a normal ingredient and all the other places have gotten it wrong by including it in their versions of the dish. Needless to say, my quest for a halfway palatable, reasonably priced lunch in this area continues. On the plus side, the decor will keep you amused, an eclectic blend of record jackets, a showcase 
115;Tried this place for first time and I was very unimpressed. I ordered a couple of dishes as takeout and  I would not recommended it. Their customer service is very bad as it look a very long time for them to complete my order even though there was no one in the restaurant. The dishes were very bland and tasteless. Also, when I got home and opened some of the dishes, I realized it was one of the items not what I ordered. I called the restaurant to explain to them about it and they seemed to not understand and say they cannot do anything about this. Overall this place has very bad customer service and need to improve themselves!
116;It's a disgusting restaurant!!!! Went there for lunch, ordered a roasted duck and fried rice. Duck smelled really bad so couldn't finish it, rice was oozing with oil with almost no chicken or eggs. The bill came as 25.95 (wtf!?) where as it was supposed to be 22 dollars, fine I didn't argue, I didn't have 15 cents so I told the server I'm coming back and then she demanded I pay with my card, I was like okaaaaaaay..... Then I found like 5 dollars in my bag and gave her 30.55 dollars but she only gave me two dollars back!!  I asked her why, she's like the rest is the tip that I have to pay for which was NOT mentioned in the bill, why would I pay for terrible food and service???  She insisted I pay her tip, I didn't argue with that cheap lady, just left the restaurant, never going back!!! Just beware of their unmentioned tip thing for shitty food, go to Ranu Thai restaurant just a few blocks away, much much better service and fresh food made in front of you from scratch! Never go to that shitty disgusting bistro
117;Went there ate the fish stew and rice and i puked 7 times the day after. So if you enjoy puking, this is the best place to go!
118;ordered some food off of justeat.ca, after ordering a decent amount of food, i found myself not liking any of it. the flavor combinations were weird at best, or just plain. the wraps promoted pancakes in them? had it, no pancakes in mine, as well the wrap came delivered in four pieces and soggy. the chicken fried rice was extremely plain, as if they just took plain white rice, some chicken, some corn and peas, and threw it into the same bowl. every time that ive ordered on justeat.ca this place pops up and offers a 20% off over 35$, i would gladly pay the extra 20% for some flavor. highly disappointed. wont order again.
119;Not worth it. My friend and I both felt sick after ordering take out. I suggest going somewhere else...
120;Horrible - avoid. Greasy food, low on taste. I nearly choked on a metal staple in my food -- not kidding! This however didn't figure heavily in my rating. The owner stated," oops! Next time we will give you a free dish!". I'll never return though.
121;I've frequented this specific location a few times and have spent good money there. Overall, the food to me is okay, nothing spectacular but you get what you pay for.Usually I get a chicken plate without rice as I can't digest Heavy carbs well. The lady there who appears to be a manager or owner is always yelling at the staff to charge people for extra. You can't even get a tiny bit of tabouli in a wrap without her yelling to charge customers 50 cents. She also only will give you two salads and won't give you anything extra to sub the gross potatoes or rice.The last straw for me was the last time I went in there. I was about fifth back in line. Ahead of me someone ordered a falafel wrap. They made the customer a chicken wrap and asked the guy if He'd take that instead. Like any normal human being he said he did care because that's not what he ordered. The lady then put it to the side after and then tried to offer it to me and was mad when I wanted tabouli in it because they couldn't sell it. Oh and guess 
122;Disgusted after my last experience! I've been frequenting here for a while, despite the lackluster food quality, as I live nearby. However after my last visit I will not be patronizing this location ever again.I arrived at around 7pm on a monday and ordered the the Chicken Schwarma wrap. Although it was close enough to dinner rush, the chicken "schwarma" was scooped out of a bin (not taken directly from the schwarma), and was placed directly in the wrap (not grilled). As a result, the schwarma was cold. Further, the chicken tasted to be rancid and had a foul odor. I took a few bites, and had to toss the entire thing. As I write this, one day later, I now have painful stomach cramps and indigestion, which suggests to me that the chicken was in fact compromised.I've been to other AB's, and have been mostly satisfied, however this location is the exception. Each time I've gone I've been disappointed, as the food is lackluster and lacks freshness. The service is also poor.Suffice to say I will NOT be return
123;Simply put, a poorly run business. Taxes were done incorrectly, took longer to complete than what they said it would, and the guy made it clear he was happy to put as little effort into being helpful as possible when I arrived to the business venue.
124;Used this company to do all my taxes for 2012. This company made so many mistakes and filed incorrect numbers. I was audited and spent many phone calls and hours trying to fiqure out the mess they made. I explained to Roslyn Saul and she wanted $800 to help me with the audit on top of the over $6000 I paid to have my taxes prepared. They made the errors and they were not there to explain them to Revenue Canada. I will be taking them to small claims court in the near future. I thought I was hiring professionals to do my taxes but I was wrong.
125;staff are very unfriendly. also the person who make the burger doesnt seem like know what she doing. 1 star for the meat.also the person who put meats and bacons to the gril not wearing any gloves...
126;I've eaten at this location a couple of times in the past and always had a miserable experience with the manager. He either is on the phone and delays taking my order or he gets impatient if I take longer than a millisecond to decide either beef or chicken. Today I decided on a chocolate milkshake. The South Street location at Yonge and Broadway makes excellent chocolate shakes but unfortunately I was near this Avenue and Lawrence one. The manager made the worst chocolate shake I've ever had the misfortune of drinking. It was thin and wimpy and more like thickened chocolate milk than a shake. I wouldn't even categorize what this guy made as a shake. It would be insulting to rich, thick, ice cream filled milkshakes everywhere to call that sad plastic cup of thickened chocolate milk a shake. I'm done with this location. The manager is unpleasant and his staff have this fear filled look in their eyes like "please don't judge me by this guy". This place is worthless.
127;They claimed that their credit card machine was not connecting. Two days in a row. When told we didn't have Canadian dollars, they offered to take US dollars on the 1:1 course. Scammers.
128;By far the worst Japanese AYCE place I've been to.  When I got there on a Thurs night, the place was almost totally empty with maybe like two tables of customer which is a bad sign since it means a slow turnover of food.  Selection was really limited for AYCE.  Sushi and sashimi were of very poor quality (Even for AYCE level).  Seaweed were sticky and not fresh from all the sashimi.  Spider roll had no 'soft shell crab or so little that you can't taste it.  Philadephia roll had like the smallest of sliver of smoked salmon.  Cooked items were horrible as well.  My wife could not even eat the beef udon she orderd.  The chicken and beef skewers were grossly overcooked.  I couldn't say there was one item that I ordered in which I enjoyed.  A place that can mess up chicken terriyaki really sums up what this place is all about.  Even with a $10 off coupon from a flyer, this place does not product value nor quantity.  Despite a slow night, the staff was not very attentive.  They weren't horrible, but were not very f
129;This restaurant is very low quality.You'll first notice that it is a buffet, that in and of itself doesn't always mean low quality. I've eaten at some high quality Japanese buffets in Scarborough. Be warned, this is not one of them.Upon entering the restaurant, you'll notice two things:1. It's empty 2. Nowhere does it give you the priceIt wasn't until I got the bill, did I notice that this restaurant was quite reasonable at $13.95. However, I still won't eat here again.You are immediately seated but there seems to be some confusion between them two servers as who will seat you. As I mentioned the restaurant was empty yet somehow I ended up sitting next to the only other people in the restaurant. When they left, the next people sat in their spot...so right away, no privacy.When a patron pulls out his laptop, one would assume that they would be using the free wifi....it was available but you couldn't get on the internet with it. Nobody came to help, thankfully, I wasn't in need of Internet but when
130;I don't usually write a lot of reviews but this time I felt COMPELLED to write one. My husband and I were here yesterday and the food was not horrible. Everything was ok until they missed our order of sashimi. No big deal, I let the waitress know and she was like "ok". Then, I heard the chefs behind the sushi bar/counter whispering and looking at us. I was a little creeped out so I kept my eye on them. Here comes the horrible part....I heard someone spitting. My husband heard it too. Not a little spit but a giant mucous spit (he literally sounded like he was going to gag). I looked up and saw the CHEF BEHING THE SUSHI BAR SPIT on the floor while they prepared our sashimi. I had no words. That was the nastiest thing I have ever seen. What kind of chef spits where he prepares food and IN FRONT of customers? We were sitting right in front of the sushi bar/counter.I told my husband, he was grossed out. We will never be back again.oh and by the way, my husband felt sick 3 hours after eating there. AVOID PLE
131;AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE BLACK PLAGUE. I've eaten at plenty of Sushi places but my god, none of them were so bad that warranted me to make a Yelp account and warn people not to go there at any cost even if it was free. I really don't even know where to start. Food          1/10Service       0/10Ambiance   3/10Cleanliness 4/10Food QualityThe chicken Teriyaki and Skewers tasted absolutely disgusting, as soon as I took one bite of each I began to vomit, I couldn't tell if the meat was expired or severely undercooked. The meat on their Beef Ribs were cut to smaller pieces like they were shrapnels and when we ordered 30 pieces they only brought out 20. The Beef Mushroom roll wasn't separated properly and in drenched in this disgusting sauce that tasted like duck vomit. The Green and red dragon rolls that we ordered were tasteless and incredibly warm, as if their avocado and salmon sashimi weren't properly refrigerated to the right temperature. ServiceFrom the moment I entered, everything in my body tol
132;Do not know how this place got such good reviews.  Waitress or the owner of the place was cutting her nails in the back.  Secondly, food was alright, edible, but probably one of the worst if not the worst sushi places I have ever been to.  More customers came and waitress was still cutting her nails, I would really have forgiven her had she had stopped but seriously........how many people have to come into the restaurant before you stop.Only one waitress for the whole night from 6-9PM so service was pretty much down the drain along with our appetites.  Only thing that really saved it was the fact that it was probably cheaper than a lot of other Japanese AYCE as the bill for two people after tax was under 55 dollars without tip.Many other great Japanese AYCE to go to but do not DO NOT go to this one warning you now =)
133;The sushi rolls had too much rice--like, a ridiculous amount. I get that it's AYCE so it's reasonable to expect more rice in their rolls than usual, but the Boston Roll had so much rice, I had to deconstruct it to find the fish. After requesting less rice, they filled my rolls with tempura flakes instead. The sashimi didn't taste right, and although my son was fine after eating his meal, I was a bit ill.
134;Very low quality. I ordered veggie combo - rolls had no veggies in them - all rice. Salad was a few slices of lettuce with dressing. Miso soup tasted like dishwater.  My hubby had bento box said it was good but I will never return.
135;Really bad quality food. And overpriced. Great if you just want a beer and a patio but that is it!
136;The location is the only good thing about this restaurant, great view of the water and the CN tower. The food however is awful! Coleslaw lacked any sort of flavour, the fish and chips batter was not tasty and was soggy the tartar sauce lacked the proper flavour. The service was slow, we were given one small glass of water and never offered a refill.
137;Beautiful day in Toronto and we were sat quickly. Our waiter (who, despite everything that was going on around him) was great. We got some drinks and ordered a burger and fish tacos. 45 minutes later, the burger came out. No complaints - it was great, and with good weather a small wait is ok. Was told that the fish tacos were 'coming right up' more than 3 times. After the burger plate was cleared, they admitted that they're pretty sure that the kitchen lost the chit. Totally fine - but when we asked if there was anything we could order that would be faster, that wasn't an option. 90 minutes after we were sat, and no less than 4 tables received their fish tacos, I spoke with a manager. They comp'd a great deal of the bill, but that's unacceptable. Amazing view and great for drinks and conversation - avoid ordering food at all costs.
138;I write this as I wait. And wait. And wait. It is the first day of the season they are sorry service is very slow. Strike that. Very slow doesn't describe it. We have been waiting at least 40 minutes. They have thought to bring out anything for the kids like the fries we ordered. Even a hamburger bun would be welcome. Stay away from this place at all costs unless you just had a snack and mind a long wait.
139;This place is not authentic and I had the same experience where I had rotten fish served in my sushi.  They didn't apologize when I confronted them either.  I was so disgusted I forgot to take photos.  But it looks similar of someone's post here on yelp.  I wish I checked yelp before coming here.  I had to pay the full bill too here.  Never coming back here again.
140;Bah.  This was the worst Japanese food I've had in a long time and very expensive.  I would give it a pass.
141;This HAS TO BE the worst place for japanese food EVER. I wish I was over exaggerating. I went with a deal I purchased on Wagjag. Parking was on the streets wasn't too bad but the store is quite small from the outside so be on the lookout. Came in the restaurant with all the waiter and waitresses speaking mandarin. That was already quite a disappointment. They have quite a large menu and we were asked 5 TIMES if we were ready to order with 5 minutes in between. Obviously not! and by the end of the night I noticed this restaurant really likes their carrots and cucumbers T________T"  We ordered the : MISO SOUP AND SALAD CAME WITH OUR MEAL - the miso soup was oddly sweet and the salad.. usually i'll complain about not enough dressing but this was DROWNING in dressing to the point that the lettuce was soft. Also their dressing has alot of pepper. Golden Live Oysters - GROSS. It was covered in cheese, CARROTS AGAIN, mayo, and garlic. The mayo was JUST GROSS and plus from the smell you could tell this wasn't f
142;Had a group voucher for this place and decided to try it out.We got there and the place was fairly quiet, just a few tables were taken. I ordered a couple of starters and maki for the entree. Another ordered a bento box and another ordered the teppanyaki. It took awhile for the starters to arrive. The edamame was good, the vegetable tempura was just OK. I've had better. I wanted to get a refill of my tea, but I was never able to get the waiter's attention since he seemed to always be in the back. Finally the entrees arrived, but the teppanyaki was not ready. The bento box was decent. The maki was a bit off. I ordered crispy spicy tuna and crispy spicy salmon maki. The crunchy bits were covered the sushi like a dumping of snow. I had to use the chopsticks to wipe off all the crunchy bits in order to get to my food. YUCK. Also the tuna was light in colour, I'm used to seeing the tuna darker in colour. It didn't taste like what I am use to having at other places either. The salmon maki was good, but I wish
143;AVOID! One of the worst "Japanese" restaurants I have ever been to. The miso soup was tasteless to begin. Then we both ordered lunch. I had the Udon beef noodles that were OK but nothing special. My friend had the shrimp and vegetable tempura meal which only included 2 types of vegetables (thick sweet potato and thick squash) which were all soggy and mushy. No broccoli, no eggplant, nothing else except 2 shrimps. When we told the server and chef about our dislike for the meal he came up with excuses and did not offer to take it off the bill even though it was absolutely terrible and hardly touched. Avoid this place at all costs. The sushi itself was also OK but there are way better places to go in the Beaches with much better service.
144;Came here a couple of years ago and it was great. Sushi was fresh and the price was fair. Fast forward to now.. I've ordered delivery from them multiple times and the first time was great. I loved that they had uni sushi, it's something that I always look for when I have sushi. After that, it just went downhill from there.By the time it arrived, it just had this nasty fishy smell and taste. The sashimi was not fresh at all. The uni was not cleaned thoroughly and I had a bite of sand. I thought it was a one off and ordered from them after several months. Nope.. same thing.
145;Couldn't give any lower than this....Sushi taste like shit rice blend as hellHot pot thingy the meat are tasteless too Have to use soy sauce I can't even.....Literally the worst Japanese (whatever you named it)Restaurant I have ever have in Toronto.Thanks for reminding me there are still shit food here
146;I have been here a couple times before, and was pleased with the food....BUT...on my last visit, we ordered our usual including spider rolls. It came out extremely burnt. When I tried to explain the issue, the waitress took it to the chef and came back and said it was ok. They refused to replace it. We obviously did not eat the dish, but were still charged for it.I've never experienced such poor customer service. Will never go here again.
147;This is the single worst restaurant I have ever eaten at. We came in for a friend's birthday a few weeks ago thinking of getting Sushi. To our delight there was also a Teppanyaki grill so we asked if that was available - they agreed. About 5 minutes in the chef asked if we knew what they did at a Teppankayi show and essentially whether we could tell him what it was. The chicken was burnt externally and raw on the inside the fish melted on the grill and the wait staff rude and defensive in the face of all this. Since none of us had eaten (it was flat inedible) we asked at least that we at least not pay - the wait staff, however, insisted. When asked the name of the owner they grew shifty eyed. We've vowed to back and have the charge reversed - this ruined the evening. I wouldn't wish this restaurant or that experience on my enemies - much less a friend. I strongly suggest you steer clear
148;I came here for the dinner buffet on a Monday there was not too many people and the buffet looked really good however most of the food was just not that great although there were a lot of items very few meat selections they had roast lamb however it was not very tender the majority of the buffet was lacking in my opinion there were exceptions the dips were all fantastic with the fresh pita bread and the dessert bughasta (custard wrapped in filo) was amazing however I lowered their rating significantly due to their service it was simply horrible I'll admit I just got into town (here for work) and was tired this place was not too far from my hotel (4 points by Sheraton) and I came here in comfortable clothes t shirt and jeans nor did i do my hair (as i just had a shower and was gonna go straight to the hotel and sleep after dinner) I do understand I possibly did not make the best first impression that being said they gave very little attention to me the waitress asked every table except mine if they needed some
149;The staff in there are rude. Refuse to pay performers as agreed (they hire a dance crew) and the staff (older men) harass young dancers. This place has 2.6 stars on Maps, just as bad a rating as it here. Avoid and go elsewhere.
150;We were four couples and spent our Valentines night there. Over priced for what you get. Mazza was minimal and tasted terrible and only matched by terrible service and attitude from the owner/manager or whatever he thinks he is. They didn't have enough staff and service, even though they sold tickets to the event. All they cared about was over charging. No concept of customer service. Really, $5.99 for a bottle of Nestle water. Live and learn and never again.
151;AVOID! I got duped with the chicken teriyaki that came with miso and salad. Added shrimp tempura.Salad was drizzled with KETCHUP! KETCHUP!Miso soup did NOT have tofu in it! Barely any seaweed. Teryaki was loaded with sugary sauce with next to NO chicken! The shrimp tempura was just deep fried with white flour batter. Paid 30$ with tax nd tip.AVOID THIS PLACE IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO EXPERIENCE PROPER JAPANESE CUISINE! I AM JUST THANKFUL FOR AVOIDING THE SUSHI AT THIS PLACE!
152;Normally I don't check on yelp before eating somewhere new. Risky, I know, but I prefer my opinion to be unbiased to the fullest.This is one of those times that I wish I had...I stopped in on my way to Costco because I hadn't seen it before. I am a sushi lover and love checking out new places in Markham. It was dead - not a single person there but me- and in hindsight, I get it. I got the bento box with chicken teriyaki, steamed rice, 3 piece California and spicy salmon (I asked for all spicy salmon) 3 pieces salmon sushi and tempura, which consisted of one small shrimp and a few slivers of vegetable. It also came with the standard miso soup and salad.Where to begin? The salad was terrible and incredibly small. We're talking a mouthful here, a few pieces of lettuce, a chunk of cucumber and some stringed carrot covered in what I presume was teriyaki sauce. The miso was lukewarm and watery and probably the worst miso soup I've ever had. The stuff I make at home out of a bag tastes miles better.Then th
153;Simply awful.This place has been there for a while.I went there for lunch and ordered a bento box. Portions were small, the food didn't seem fresh and, relatively speaking, it's not cheap compared to the other restaurants in the area. I guess I should have expected this because there was no one else in the restaurant. The waitress was nice, though.
154;The waitress there was very polite and that is the only reason why I gave this place 1 star..The food there was horrible and will never go back there again.. Everything there was sooooo not fresh and the rice they used there for the rolls was soggy.. As for the tempura, it was so oily that oil dripped out when squeezing it with my chop-sticks... Nasty.. Highly NOT-recommend...
155;They use to be on time delivering food within an hour or around an hour. Now it keeps taking them more than 2 hrs. Will definitely not order from them again. One star given only for the food.
156;The one with the plain white rice sushi and yellow coloured white snapper.My friends and I just ordered two platters and we're now on our way to a grocery store for sashimi because even that would have to be better than what we had. The only reason we ordered from here was because it was on Just-Eat.ca and we wanted to try the service out. The sushi was plain white rice sushi without any vinegar taste and all of the rolls were flavourless. There was white snapper that was yellow in color and questionable in whether it was safe to eat. I highly suggest you think twice before you consider ordering from this place.
157;It was Saturday past 6pm.  Kids just finished at Angus Glen arena and was starving. We decided on Japanese.We didnt want to spend too much since kids usually want quantity, not quality for food.We passed on some of the AYCE sushi places nearby.  Wife remembered seeing this place. I ran into look at the menu, and we looked at the yelp reviews, but kids were starving!!! So ..in we go.Even though it had terrible reviews.I can now say that all the reviews are pretty spot on.Bathrooms were...dirty, no paper towels, needed a good cleaning!The whole place needs a reno!All of the food was tasteless and bland.Even the kids noticed the food quality was bad.We were there for about an hour, the place was dead and no one else came in.  This is a Saturday night!! Prime time.The lady server was nice and friendly, but i do not see myself going back.Seriously the sushi from t&t or sunnys is much better!3stars for service0 stars for food
158;I've seen this restaurant located there for many years, so I figured if it lasted this long, the sushi must be at least decent.It was overpriced for what I got.  Ordered a sushi lunch special, the sushi was loaded with rice with a tiny piece of fish on top.  The rice fell apart when I picked it up with the chopstick.I could of just ate at Dragon Legend for the same price and get more selection and better quality food.
159;Horrible place ever!!  The fish cut was small & thin....wasn't fresh at all!  Part of the order was chirashi...lettuce used as garnish.  Washrooms were filthy!!  Urgh!! Pretty run down place!!  Never going back there again!!
160;Ordered for delivery at 5PM arrived at 6:30PM, obviously the food was cold and when I stated it was really late, the delivery man simply replied "yea, okay."As for the food, it was even more horrendous, I ordered Yakidori, beef teriyaki dinner, soft shell crabs x2 and Yaki (yucky) udon.  The Yakidori was bland in flavour, was slabbed with teriyaki sauce, no signs of grilling, the soft shell crabs were soggy and it had no dipping sauce.  As for the beef teriyaki, it had nearly no beef, only a few slices here and there and the Yaki udon, was just sloppy and barely any seafood, chicken or vegetables.Horrible food, horrible service.  Do not eat here.
161;The staff is friendly and they always have a smile but The chicken at this location is very dry you need a lot of soda or beer to wash it down.  I don't know if its because its a Harvey's/ Swiss ChaletAlso the floors are VERY slippery
162;Never will I ever - eat Swiss Chalet again.We placed our order at approximately 6:30pm over the phone and were advised it would be ready within 20 minutes. When we arrived at 7pm, we were alarmed to find a woman yelling at the manager for placing her order an hour earlier -- and still not being ready. This should have been our warning. The take out section of the restaurant was packed naively enough, we stood in line anyway to pay for our order -- $70 worth of Swiss Chalet. The cashier advised it would be a 5 - 10 minute wait...And so, the waiting commenced. After 25 minutes, the woman who had been previously yelling at the manager, left equipped with her order.40 minutes go by...we still haven't received our order. I wait in line again to inquire about the status of our order the cashier states she'll go check...when she returns, she's accompanied by the Harvey's manager. (As this location is shared between the two.) She advises that there's FORTY ORDERS ahead of ours...what? We'd been there already 
163;I kept seeing Tim Hortons every where. Im unsure exactly what it is but i stopped because i needed something really quick. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich as it said on the menu and it was really a soft panini with cheese in between. I also got the potato wedges and apple juice. The juice was a mini juice like the ones kids get with a happy meal and the wedges...were..... hmm not good what so ever they tasted baked. Have you ever eaten not fresh baked fries or wedges? Neither have I until now and you wont like it.
164;awful place!!!   nobody spoke English, no available tables to sit.  Full of middle eastern men speaking another language (Loudly)   taking up tables playing dominoes and cards.      Wednesday at 9pm - felt like you'd walked into an international airport , disgusting.   Staff (2ppl) were very busy with drive thru window. Polite and efficient. I'd guess students working part-time. They should get awards for working there!Suggest police presence, for the illegals, someone phone immigration.  ## omigod at 10pm a Van pulls up outside and ten people scurry out to it like rats## employment job van??!!  wtf
165;I went to mr Greek at 1000 finch this past Sunday and I should say I have never received a bad service like this before ! Our waitress didn't engage with us at all and the food ( mixed gyros plate + souvlaki sticks ) were very dry ! The salad was old and soaked into the dressing !I also ordered tea which was for 1.95 and when she brought us the bill it said 2.25 ! I brought this to her attention saying that it's not about 30 cents it's about the principal ! She got all nervous as she already knew about this and was surprised that someone actually noticed this discrepancy!Overall I don't think this mr Greek should even get 1 out of 5 ! You certainly can have better food and service at other Greek Resturant .Don't recommend this location at all !
166;Crappy service and rude servers who don't care about there jobs . Stay away and oh the food is really poor quality. Don't know how they stay in business
167;Absolutely the worst run McDonalds in all of Toronto. The food quality sucks and the place is filthy most of the time. The service is extremely slow and the drinks/ condiment area is always dirty with no napkins. I have lived in the area 5 years and it is getting worse and worse. I don't know why McDonalds corporate offices don't do something about this location.
168;Worst McDonald's ever. 2 people ordering but 30 people waiting. Wrong orders. It's actually hillarious anyone can run something this bad
169;Disorganized McDonalds management is very weak at this location and half of the times ur order is wrong
170;This is the slowest McDonald's i have ever been to. The drive through is a complete joke. More than once it has taken almost 20 minutes to get through when there are only 4 cars in front of me. Recently they put in a double lane, so i went back and assumed they would be faster. Somehow they managed to be slower. The food quality is pretty mediocre compared to other McDonald's locations. Inside it is usually dirty and the employees clearly hate working there, and do a pretty good job showing it.  They also have a serious problem with homeless people in the drive through hiding behind the intercom and trying to order food while you are ordering. Overall this has to be the worst McDonald's, but sadly it is one of the only ones in that area, so the owners don't care. I would give 0 stars if i could.
171;Deserving of 0 stars, while in this unorganized "fastfood" joint. I witnessed one of the more incompetent staff members criticizing a customer who's order they got wrong not once or twice but 4 times, the staff members admission not assumption anyway when I got to order I was informed "all day breakfast" is limited to one item(my words not hers), despite the advertisement behind her showing it is a number of items, major disappointment as I was looking forward to having the breakfast for lunch. Which makes me question if the breakfast is made fresh or just left under a heat lamp like the rest of McDonald's sandwiches. If this location truly wants to compete it should have the full breakfast menu, especially given the presence of an all day breakfast restaurant in the adjacent stockyards plaza.
172;This has been by far the most repulsive, disgusting and dirty McDonald's I've been to. Furthermore, the service is slow and the "kids" working are extremely disorganized. I shall never return to this location ever. In fact, I think I'd avoid any McDonald's within a 5km from this location as the clientele in this neighbourhood has a lot to be said.
173;Probably the worst McDonald's in the GTA.The staffs are usually yelling at each other and not being able to handle the homeless people coming in and sitting down for a few hours and panhandle.When you place a order, it usually takes a pretty long time to come. The newly renovated drive through is a disaster, it is a 2 PA system split to one window where you wait quite a long time and the line up becomes astronomical where to the point you should just either go inside or go home.This location need some better staff management to be trained cease and desist. Witness an altercation with another person lining up, due to open alcoholic beverages they brought in and the management working did nothing and just walked away. Quit if you can't fullfil your role.Renovate this place and hire people who actually want to work. If not let them go. This place slowly became the worst McDonald in the GTA.
174;It's a new branch, recently opened and I guess that was the reason it took 20 minutes for the front desk to finish her talk over the phone and give me a table. Another half an hour for the waitress to get my order. The food quality was the same as any other BP branch but it was obvious that employees were clueless on how to treat the guests. I guess wait another 3-6 months till employees settle there.
175;I should have read the reviews for this place before deciding to come here for dinner. This location recently opened and the food here is awful! DO NOT GO HERE!We ordered a nachos for our appetizer and pizza burger and the big dipper for our entrees.The nachos were ok but they were stingy on the cheese. The beef patty for the pizza burger was still cold like it just came out of the fridge. They remade it and the patty was only warm. There was no steam coming from the burger. It's obvious that the beef patty was originally frozen.The big dipper sandwich was missing the crispy onion straws and braised onions. The manager tried to explain to me that the braised onion is mainly in the dipping sauce but the menu clearly indicates that it should be in the sandwich and it also shows it in the picture! He was apologetic but he should have admitted to the error rather than make up an excuse that's not even valid!They took both items off the bill but still made me pay for the nachos even though the entire exp
176;the worse customer service ever! They didnt have burgers from kids menu. 30 later when the food started coming out they inform us of this and want to charge us for a full burger from adults menu instead
177;Worst food I've ever had in all Canada! Unfortunately I went there 2 times and both times food was not fresh and quality was so poor !
178;We went to this new branch 2 times. The service was slow and the food was garbage. The worst Boston Pizz I've ever been to.
179;Haven't been to Boston pizza for a while, but this place was super slow .. !! Pizza took an hour . Salad was awful . food was garbage ! Hope you read this before you go there .
180;This is the worst Boston Pizza ever! They've been open for less than a year and I went closer to their grand opening. You'd think they would try to wow new customers.But no.They were soooo stingy with everything. My cheese "dip" was not a dip because there was so little cheese that I had to scrape it off the tray with a knife to spread on my bread.The nachos again barely had any cheese on them. We sent them back with the owner and he returned after probably adding a pinch of cheese. Really?The pizza was the worst part. Very little toppings, huge crust, and cheese that didn't even cover the sauce. This place will probably shut down soon, I hope.
181;They were busy for UFC 208. The bartender sold me on getting the pizza bread 'souped' up in her words, and punched in the wrong order. That's fine I get it. She's busy mistakes happen. The manager stared at me after she clearly told him what happened. He stared blankly at me and didn't even come to apologize for the mistake. I'm not the type to look for anything to be free but the gesture would have been nice. I'm currently in the service industry myself and I can tell you right now that this has been the worst management I have seen in while. Further more the restaurant I work at is twice the size of this place. Disappointed since BP is from my home town.
182;Went there twice. First time was Friday night and we waited for over an hour for food, and the pizza was soggy. Manager came out to apologize and gave us free pizza voucher to come back and try again. We thought we'd give them another try, since it was a busy Friday and they just opened. Second time we went on Wednesday night. The restaurant was half empty, but we still waited an hour for our food! Do not go there if you are hungry!
183;I like pizza pizza. I really do.  But this specific location is horrible. I feel as though they have figured out that they can get by with serving an inferior product because they will get customers because of their location.  Staff is rude. Location is dirty and pizza is horrible. If you are desperate enough to need a pizza in this area, go to Pizza Nova or Pizzaville down the street. East of this location. Your money will be better served.
184;This place should be condemned!I walked in here because my four year old nephew was hungry and wanted a slice. After a beautiful walk on the Beaches boardwalk this was the nightmare that felt like it  would never end. This place was filthy and I have pictures to prove it. Not one of the cooks wore gloves or hat, there were chicken bones and sauce all over the furniture and floor (I have pictures)and the cashier lady kept scratching her head. But since my nephew insisted we stood in a line with 8 people in front of us and it took them an hour to serve us. While waiting we heard them use "R" rated proanities at customers, yell at little kids and generally mess up almost all orders. When I mentioned to my brother in law how ridiculous this was, the cashier lady started fighting with me. I have never ever been treated so badly and felt really bad for our family visiting from Colorado who had loved Toronto up until then.
185;Huge stomach ache also bf to .  Pizza wasnt that good Pizza wasnt that good although the hours are good!
186;NEVER. EAT. HERE. My boyfriend and I have been ordering from here a lot in the past year. Pizza Pizza isn't great quality in general, nothing fancy, just some standard pizza. And that's what we were getting... Until recently.The past dozen times we ordered, they've screwed something up. Missing cans of pop. Missing dips. Mediums instead of larges. Completely wrong orders. Late delivery, with no free pizza. Driver coming with no change (no  I'm not tipping you $20, yes, please go get change... I mean, seriously?) But what happened tonight was INSANE. We ordered 2 panzarottis, his with just cheese and chicken (borrrrinnnggg) and mine with spinach, mushrooms, sun dried tomato, and extra cheese (yum). They arrive nearly 40 minutes later. One looks alright, the other is dark brown, cracked and crumbling. This one, of course, is mine. I cut it open and discover that there is no spinach inside. Also, not much of anything else. Barely any cheese at all, let alone extra cheese. Basically just a wad of over coo
187;Terrible takeout. Infested with little black flies. Would never get a slice to go there again. I went back in one night just for beverage and thought I would get a bag of their to-go brownies and they when I got home the bag said it expired 2 months ago.
188;Hands down the worst pizza in Toronto... correction, probably the entire world. Flavourless tomato sauce is directly from a can. If hate could manifest itself as a pizza, this is what it would taste like.
189;I would give this place a zero if i could. I wish I could.After this summer, i vowed never to set foot in this disgusting place again. Basically this place is the only thing next to the beaches so if you dont bring any food you dont have many options. Everytime I come here the place is filthy. We would ask the staff numerous times to clean off a table for us and they told us to just sit at a clean one. Silly us, why didnt we think of that? They were all disgusting with crumbs, juice, and tomato sauce all over them. We got fed up so we started cleaning the tables ourselves. In my opinion this is unacceptable to have customers in an eating establishment bussing tables. Everytime we order there is something wrong with the food quality as well. This last time I went I ordered plain chicken wings. I opened the box and there were 2 big white FEATHERS on one of my chicken wings. I am not a picky eater so i simply went to the counter and asked for them to replace that one wing. The man grabbed a pair of tongs and s
190;Second time i ordered from this location and both time my food took almost two hours delivery should of ordered popeyes.
191;So I've been here half hour waiting for my food. They are serving everyone else because we have chicken bowls -_-
192;Terrible. We got home after ordering a 9 piece family bucket of chicken and started eating only to discover that the taste and smell of the chicken was off. After trying to eat a few pieces we quickly figured out that the chicken/oil was rancid, at which point we couldn't stomach eating any more of it. Waste of time and money.Either the oil the chicken is being fried in is old and has gone off, or the chicken had been sitting out under the heater for so long that it had turned rancid. Either way the standards for health and cleanliness are obviously lacking at this KFC location and should be investigated!When we called the location to complain we were told the oil was fine, nothing was wrong, and that KFC headquarters only has them change the oil once a week once you can't see past 2 inches. Ew. Here's a clue: If a customer says something is off you should listen and look into it, not argue, brush them off and declare that it's fine.
193;Sad.  This very wonderful hotel has a very obvious restaurant problem.  The service was astonishingly bad and the food just better than average.  The atmosphere is nice enough.  There is a hip pastel-chalk menu written at the very attractive entrance.  As soon as you enter, you realize something is wrong.  We stood there for a full five minutes before anyone greeted us and then I would not call it much of a greeting.  There were few diners in the restaurant but no staff visible anywhere while we were waiting.  Another patron was waiting outside the kitchen door, hoping to get some service.  When a staff person did come out, it seemed like it was her first day.  She did not know where to seat us, there were about 40 empty tables.  After disappearing for a while, she came back with a small pad to take our order and was unfamiliar with the menu, the English language and how to ask a co-worker for help.  She then returned three times to clarify our order and then a fourth time, fully twenty minutes after our orde
194;My third restaurant for Summerlicious 2010.  It's funny how my restaurants went from "amazing to crappy" in the end.  I went with my coworkers last Friday at lunch.  There wasn't many people - so I thought the service was going to be somewhat fast (since it was a weekday and the lot of us had to go back to work). Surprisingly, the bread was quite amazing there, so I can't complain about that.  I got myself the following:- Poached Atlantic Salmon- Forest Mushroom & White Asparagus Risotto- Banana Fritter ParfaitThe poached atlantic salmon was okay.  I didn't like the yogurt dressing on top -- it was too sour and didn't match the salmon very well.The risotto was horrific.  It was too creamy and I just couldn't finish it.  My coworker as well.  The funny thing is that on the menu, it said cherry tomatoes would be part of the dish - and there was NO TOMATOES.The dessert was okay - but I felt like I could've walked into any Japanese restaurant, ordered ice cream, and tempura bananas and I would've end
195;Food is edible. Some dishes are a miss, others a hit.The problem with this place is with the management.Service is slow and awkward, and management need to treat their female colleagues respectively.Would not eat here again.
196;Went here for lunch with my friend. Arrived at around 2pm. First impressions of the restaurant was it looked like a Denny's express in the mid west United States. Server asked for drink orders as we were being seated. We would need a minute. Server comes back takes our order and tells us he ran out of fruit billinis, he ran out of white freezie cocktails too. Okay just bring us beer. The beer tasted like piss water. Order food server says they've run out of chicken and waffles. Okay, a bit frustrated I asked if we could have a couple mins to decide. 30 seconds later a random server comes.over and asks if there is a problem or if he could help us. I explained that they didn't have what we wanted and we needed a minute, is there a problem? "NO its fine" he snaps and walks away. Our server returns 20 seconds later and takes our order of a bunch of appetizers  (4 to be exact, Inc nachos, tacos, etc). Food takes forever but is fine. However server NEVER RETURNS. Never comes back to ask if everything is okay. NOTH
197;I got an email from pickle barrel... try our "new stuffed French toast" looked so good... so I went to the easiest location I could visit... last time I said I wouldn't come back... I'm stupid for not heeding my own advice.Manager who was probably the only saving grace to the establishment looked at me dumbfounded when I requested the "new" item. So I showed him on my phone, the email. Straight up told me, "we're a bit dated." So I told him I would need a few more minutes to find a new item. But I stuck around and ordered a coke.The server brought my beverage instantaneously which would be a good thing, but she was upset that I hadn't decided yet, in 30 seconds, sorry... I asked for 1 minute...She came back after 5, I'm pressed for time and I knew I was fubar today, I was going to order something else but I just went with the nachos, you can't screw that up and they possibly can't take forever...Forever later and several games of candy crush, she brings it out. Drops it on the table walks off.  I sh
198;Although the Pickle Barrel (at least in Toronto) are now on a unified menu, and all their food pretty well tastes the same, I had three problems with this branch of the franchise: 1) Very low-rent decor, similar to cafeteria seating, not as nice as other PBs, 2) Very blase/uninterested service-people, 3) I got quite sick after the burger with feta. It tasted okay, but I was in the washroom for hours that night - I hadn't eaten anything else that day that could have been responsible, and I've had this meal before at other PBs. Oh well - I won't be going back...
199;Visited this newly renovated Pickel Barrel only to have such a terrible and disappointing experience. If I had a choice to give zero stars, I seriously would.My biggest issue here is that every person who entered the kitchen did not wear a hair net, beard net, or a hat/cap or something to catch the hair (servers, prep staff, and even the manager). I could not believe my eyes when I saw a server with a full blown beard going in and out of the kitchen with plates of food on his arms. There should be a policy within any establishment that serves food to people that they have the option to either have food servers shave their beard or cover it with a beard net.  And then there was my server who didn't even tie her long hair up. This was most upsetting when we found a hair in my sister's soup.We started off the night thinking it was going to be a great meal as the restaurant went through some very nice changes (a very well needed renovation). It immediately went downhill when I noticed that our server was very
200;I'll start by saying that we used to love Pickle Barrel!It was a place of comfort food for us.But...Last time we ate at this (Centerpoint) location the place was at around 50% capacity yet the food took close to an hour to come out, it arrived cold and not fresh, and not all dishes came out.We ordered pretty basic dishes mostly, yet they managed to screw it all up.The hamburger arrived hardly warm, with cold and greasy fries. We asked to change the fries and got the new plate after we finished all our meal. It was still soft and greasy, but at least it was hot. (Had a feeling like they microwaved old fries, actually).The salad that was supposed to have crispy noodles and nuts came with soggy noodles and hardly any nuts.The kids' Fajita came with cheese that looked like plastic - all oily on the outside, and hard. Looked like it was standing outside on a warm day. We also ordered a side of mashed potatoes with that, but it never came.The kids' penne came with no sauce on it, and it also looked like it 
201;At the Pickle Barrel for lunch, ordered soup which was too salty & then my Father's lunch plate came. Smoked Salmon on dark rye but wait! It comes with hair from the kitchen & certainly not my Dad's!!! Server apologized no sign of a manager anywhere. Pretty upset. Do not recommend it here. The decor was my highlight.
202;I ate here yesterday.The hostess was great, everything else was terrible.The order was wrong, and when we had to ask for missing items, the waiter rolled his eyes at us. The food was tasteless and bland and we left it half eaten and went for a bite in the food court.Definitely won't be back.
203;From 5 months ago:"Ordered pasta from here and the pasta was slightly uncooked.  It was a lobster and shrimp pasta but it looked like stir fry because they added carrot, spinach and onions.  The pasta sauce was watery too.  Ordered sandwiches and they were small in size.  Too pricey for the quantity and absolutely no quality.This is the first and last time coming to this joint."So I received a message from Pickle Barrel asking me to try again and so we did TODAY:Calamari - too bland, zero taste or saltJumbo Club Sandwich - bread was super dryBaked Potato Skins with Bacon & Cheese - they forgot to put the bacon inCali Chicken Grilled Cheese Sandwich - missingNo cutlery or napkins were provided with out take out order either, as they are "grab and go" so it was my fault, according to them.Seriously.... My very last time!!!!!
204;Service slow, food only ok.  Decor dated and ambience kind of crusty.  Would never go back.
205;I was actually being generous by giving them a star. I'm surprised health Canada hasn't issued a warrant or violation. Here's why....I was dining solo and just wanted a quick bite and a glass of vino. I decided however to try their mini fish (back) tacos. Well I waited approximately 9 minutes to be served. The few servers that I saw were running around like a chicken with their necks cut off. As a matter of fact the bussboy/server was walking by my table and I guess from my facial expression he stopped in his tracks and asked me if I've been served. I thought that was a strange question to ask if he didn't see any cutlery nor water in front of me. I ordered mini fish tacos, side order of fries, water w/ lemon and a glass of Pinot. The hostess brought my water without lemon, I reminded her about the lemons. She blatantly and unapologetically said "we're out of lemons" and walked away...not impressed by the lack of professionalism. The tacos came in a super tiny saucer same size as the taco which made it ex
206;I know what you're thinking - anyone who orders a steak from Pickle Barrel deserves what's coming to them, but it was New Year's Eve so I felt like splurging a bit. I ordered Steak Frites, medium. Maybe I should feel bad about joking with my friends about how there's no way that they were going to get the steak right, but when I received it I stopped feeling bad. It was just barely pink in the middle and grey on the outside. I told the waiter I wanted to send it back. He took the plate but not without telling me that it was "still pink inside". Apparently he doesn't know the difference between medium and medium well. The second steak I got was medium rare. Still not what I asked for but I didn't mind. And hey, it actually wasn't horrible. Also, prepare to ask multiple times to get your water refilled! Probably one of my biggest restaurant pet peeves considering how simple of an ask that is...
207;My husband and I decided to have lunch here yesterday. I would suggest strongly that the management should either re train or overhaul the front of house staff as soon as possible, that's if they care enough to keep their customers. The food was ok, nothing spectacular but perfectly fine and acceptable for lunch, the restaurant was clean, apart from some dirty dishes which remained on an adjacent table to us for at least twenty minutes or so. The restaurant was moderately busy, but relaxed and not chaotic so they were not rushed off their feet. There were four service staff on duty on the 18th of April 2017. Service was appalling and they didn't have a clue of how to treat customers.We arrived and waited to be greeted at the front door, but there was no body to greet us for about five minutes. Of course this should have been a warning sign and we should have walked on to somewhere else, but we were quite hungry at the time and so chose to overlook this. Eventually a young waiter came, pointed to a booth whic
208;Where do we begin. Waiting for 20 minutes before being hastily greeted by the bus boy at our table. Insufficient cutlery. Wrong order for our nachos. Charged us extra for something we never ordered. My sisters meal was never served. When it finally was, it came on a dirty plate caked with mustard and other dirt. It was disgusting. The servers were running around the place trying to get to every table. Overall one of the worst experiences I've had at a pickle barrel. Can't justify the increases in prices in their menu when the quality of service has gone downhill. Won't be coming back to this location and I've been coming here for over 20 years. Avoid the hassle, go anywhere else.
209;The final night of my American Friend's stay in Toronto.  I decided to bring them somewhere that fits the following criteria without going too far out of the way as my Friend had an early flight out the next morning and I was doubting my ability to wake up at "6 AM" to drive them.  @@  What I do for Friends these days...Criteria #1 - Near Finch Subway StationCriteria #2 - Canadian Back BaconCriteria #3 - Montreal Smoked MeatThis Centerpoint Mall fits the bill enough as my Friend is nothing of a Foodie so doesn't require the most authentic of flavours.  Upon arriving to this Pickel Barrel as such it is typical of it's nature being inside a Mall environment.  This one however is full CLEAR glass enclosure which means from the mall path you can see everything inside.Inside is nothing worth looking at as it was the CLASSIC style decor of a Deli Shop, nothing upscale that others know of from their Yorkdale, Vaughan Mills, Markville Mall locations.  We we greeted somewhat and provided seating at a table tha
210;This was the 2nd bad experience. Once before the renovation last year and again this Jan 2 2015. Staff were eating food from heat lamp stations and one of the cooks was walking the kitchen with with food hanging from his mouth while handling food. My wife had stomach cramps from the salad. Serious contamination issues with their food preparation.
211;After a few years of giving them second chances  I decided that this will definitely be the last time. My favourite Greek salad has shrunk quite a bit and came straight from the fridge. It was freezing cold. It  was missing scallions which were always part of it, they also served it without the Pumpernickel roll it's supposed to include. The server offered us  a couple of slices of plain rye bread instead but the bread we got was not enough and stale and when we asked for more we were told that we will be charged for it. Our server looked tired, her shirt was dirty, she was not a happy camper.  I have no idea what happened to this chain but the staff are not properly trained and the quality of the food has totally tanked over then last few years. I am done.
212;It's.....well, it's a Pickle Barrel.  That used to mean something else, when I was growing up - in high school, Pickle Barrel were an easy, go-to solution for people who have differing tastes.  It made everyone happy.  Then, one day maybe 10 years ago, I remembered ordering my beloved Greek salad and it came with basically lettuce and nothing else.  For $11.99.  And I knew something terrible had happened.This Pickle Barrel is no different.  I ordered a turkey-avocado club -- their words, not mine!  A "club" suggests layers of bread, but this was just your ordinary sandwich between two slices of bread.  Instead of having real turkey, it was slimy luncheon meat, and the avocado was so minuscule I actually asked the server if there was avocado on the sandwich, he said, "Oh, no, I guess not," took it back, opened the sandwich up, noticed the one mm of avocado and brought it back saying, "Oh, no, it is there."  This sandwich that would have cost me $1.50 at home cost me $10.99.We asked for waters three times b
213;Do not eat here. Food was sub sub par. I had the bbq chicken that were as hard as hockey pucks and just slightly tasted better. I swear that it was left over from the lunch menu and kept warm till it dried out from the heat lamps either from lunch time or the previous day. I will never eat at this location again.
214;I came here on a weeknight for dinner with my family. The restaurant was quite quiet. Only 3 other tables with customers from what I could see. 4 staff on the floor. I was in a rush to be somewhere and warned the server I needed things to come quick. He acknowledged. We ordered smoothies, a salad, zucchini curd sticks, Spanish paella and fajita. - I may or may not have forgotten something. The salad, sticks and paella arrives after 45  minutes followed by the smoothies 10 minutes later. Yes, the drinks came after 50 minutes!!! I asked the server why everything took so long. He tells me that they have updated the menu and chefs are unfamiliar with the menu. Everything I've ordered has been on the menu for months! I would say that regardless, drinks should be served before my salad and main. The fajitas took very long to come and was bland. - 1.5 hour wait. The tortillas came in half the amount I usually get. I always had to wave the staff down when I needed service. It didn't seem like they wante
215;Just wow! The worst service i ever had in a restaurant. We got the food after 1:30 hours, taste awful and received the wrong foods. The manager and waitresses were so impolite and inexperienced that I do not how they do even work here. What a disappointment!
216;WARNING - Eating at any Pickle Barrel could end up in frustration and disappointment...Just look at the overall ratings of this place!I have had the misfortune of eating at almost every Pickle Barrel in the GTA over the years (usually through no choice on my part), and in virtually every one, the service or the food or BOTH have been seriously lacking! A couple of years ago I sent an email to the Customer Service department after one particularly bad dining experience, and even THAT was infuriating, because I never heard back from anyone!I am amazed that any of these restaurants are still in business.  It seems there is an absence of interest or concern for the needs of the customer from the top person, right on down in this company!I strongly urge anyone considering Pickle Barrel NOT to eat there!
217;The service was overall pretty bad. I went out with my family to use up a gift card and when it came to paying the bill, apparently the card couldn't be used because of some damage to the magnetic strip. I find that hard to believe considering this was one of two cards I got from my company just this Christmas (everyone in my company got 2). I had already used one of them just fine and stored both safely. So we had to fully pay for a meal that we wouldn't have bothered to go to if it weren't for this issue. If I didn't have a gift card, I my family wouldn't have even ordered 3 course meals and 2 draft beers either. Nothing could be done on the restaurant level.The table we got seated at was not level. Generally not good when trying to share food. Sheila, our server after getting our drinks took quite some time to get to our table to order our meals. The waters we got was in different glasses and did not have a lemon as other guests had. One of the beers had been spilled by the server as well. My ginger ale 
218;Where to even start...in spite of the string of 1-star reviews here, this place is still packed (mostly with senior citizens who probably don't read Yelp). The service was friendly, slow, and forgetful. We even had to ask for cutlery, napkins (twice) and to reconfirm our order. I think our order even forget to add the fruit as stated on the menu.  The prices weren't that cheap (like $5 for a simple matzo ball soup).It's difficult to stay mad at the servers because they seem to be cheerfully trying to work with what they're dealt with. The guests are forgiving because even with all the mess, they'll probably be back again next Sunday.I had the three eggs breakfast. The challah bread was just ordinary sliced bread, the coffee tasted like cigarettes, the potato latkes were shaped like dry potato balls (not pancake style), the water had a filmy oil with crumbs floating it in, and the eggs were pooling in oil. I still ate it because it's exactly the Sunday morning breakfast that you have when you've been out
219;I wish I could give a lower rating than the one I gave. The host showed us to our table and it took 20 minutes to get a glass of water. What was really amazing was that out of the 6 servers on the floor that night I've made eye contact with all of them to try and order but was ignored. I had to repeatedly call a server that was passing by and if I had not said it for the 6th time he would've kept walking. Truly atrocious experience.
220;Definitely the bottom of my list for dinner.1. ServiceThe manager was talking loudly with the customers. I was sitting just the table next to them. My ears hurts.As I found the appetizer - Nachos is huge, the waiter wont let me cancel my main course. He told me that the main course is ready in a min. What? I just start the appetizer and the main will be then in the warmer?!!!!! He also has no apology that he charged me the appetizer when I gave the coupon to him by the beginning of the dinner. 2. FoodI order Nachos and chopped steak. Nachos was ok and Chopped steak is a bit salty.3. Decor Outdated decoration. I was expected to be as nice as the PB in downtown. However, it is completely disappointed.
221;Had a work event here. Never again. Servers not very friendly. Dropped two plates spilt drinks on customers. Food very late. Too bad because looks nice with a great patio.
222;My friend J and I went to the Pickle Barrel at Centerpoint Mall in North York last week for lunch and we had such a horrible experience. We were seated for long time and it took anyone long time to even come by to take our order. Our waitress was very rude and treated us poorly. After that, we waited for yet long time for the food. We also took a comment card and filled it while we were there, but we didn't trust that particular restaurant to leave it there - we were thinking of sending it in to the head office or something. Because the service was so slow and we didn't want to further wait for them to process our bill, we left cash in the bill folder. The bill came up to $38+ and we left $42 (2x$20 bill and a $2 coin - we must be crazy enough to even leave a tip). We then walked out of the restaurant. Almost immediately, that waitress chased out and said we did not pay enough, she said we only left a $20 bill, a $5 bill and a $2 coin. That was very strange because we left $42 there, and wonder how one of the
223;I have no idea how this place is still open. It was good when you were in middle school and wanted something greasy and cheap. They are over priced for what they have. The staff are extremely rude as well. They have no manners or people skills at all.
224;I hope you don't try and order delivery because the lady on the phone will complain at you depending on the time you order and may turn it away. Also found hair in my food.
225;I guess this would be one of my first reviews where I kinda gotta do the bad news. I seriously was hoping that maybe the other reviews were maybe based on personal taste, but now I know better. The only positive I can say is that the prices were good, and the service was fast. But really.... it was borderline gross, and honestly I think due to the speed of his preparation of my food, it was also cold. AND I left without noticing he forgot my aroncini and had to rush out to catch me before I left in my car. I get home... everything is pretty gross.... I asked for a meat aroncini and I got a veg one (you cant tell until u crack into it)... sauce was not good, the herbs which maybe at first impression seems like fresh basil and nice sun dried tomatoes, were limp and not in that good cooked down way, more like they had been sitting around forever and just kinda chucked on there..... Don't bother with here unless you think maybe i'm just being harsh, but check out the other reviews. Though there aren't many, they 
226;few weeks ago another friend of mine went to this eatery for lunch and said that the quality of food is not like before. He also said that he wouldn't go there anymore.
227;If walking in and not being impressed enough to stay or even ask questions then this is a review. Sorry, not impressed. Seems like a limited selection of food and it didn't look appetizing to me. No one greeted me nor even smiled but did noticed that I had entered. Left and most likely will not return.
228;My second time here, also my last. In fairness the first time was good...I ordered a steak sandwich and large Greek Salad. They ran out of the bun they usually use (shit happens) and the sandwich proved to be unremarkable, boring. The salad, shame on Let's be Frank...old browning lettuce, too many onions not enough Feta, wrong dressing and get this NOT ONE OLIVE. Keep looking, this isn't the place for you
229;Have been there 3 times.  First 2 times where good with lots of food, or wouldn't of been back.3rd time the veal tasted funny and was tough, and both of us came down sick after only eating half each of our veal sandwiches.
230;My family was over the other night helping me with a cake order. We started getting hungry but weren't quite finished the cake. We checked online what time the subway closed and it said 1 am. It was only 9:30pm so we were Golden (so I thought). We finished the cake and clean up around 10:45pm and decided to make the walk across the street to grab some grub. We we arrived we noticed it was empty so I thought "great" nice and quick service.. We received far from that. Their was a special going on for 4 subs with 12 cookies or soup. We decided to order that since there were 4 of us. The lady behind the counter looked at us like we weren't speaking English. We pointed to the sign and she looked up at it then back at us with this blank stare. She didn't moved,ask what we wanted? or say anything for that matter. She just kept shaking her head as if she didn't know what we were saying. Finally the guy came over and took our order have a great deal of explaining on our part. The couple both seemed frustrated with u
231;Most HORRIBLE Subway sandwiches shop I've been to so far!1) They give VERY FEW veggies. I asked for lots of tomatoes, they gave me 3 slices (by contrast, the Subway downtown near Harbord/Spadina gives 6 when I say lots). When I ask for more, they give 1 more! Also very sparse on the other veggies as well2) I got diarrhea after eating here. After talking with some people, apparently it's got a reputation for this.Subway sandwiches is a good place. THIS one is NOT! Go to another Subway sandwiches shop.Only tried once, will never try again.
232;This subway will try to rip you off $2-3 per transaction if you're not paying attention.
233;Food tastes so bad, and some dishes are really salty. Even the steamed rice is not good.  McDonald's tastes so much better in comparison.
234;The food was cold the two times I ate at this place.  The food is good but when it's not fresh it's not.  I prefer the one at Yorkdale.  The one at Yorkdale was fresh and hot the 3 times I tried it.
235;Worst "Chinese" food ever w/rubbery and greasy chow fun, dry sesame chicken, and bright orange pad Thai.  Stay away unless you are seeking severe water retention from the excess salt and sodium.
236;It was bad -_- The drinks, the food and the service.I've always liked Tenren and I wanted to try out this "new" location out.We ordered:MILK TEAThe milk tea was so bitter and tasted so bad. Its so watered down.SESAME MILK TEAThe whole drink tasted like undissolved powder - It was so bad. You can see the two sections in different colours (one for the undissolved powder and another is the watery substance). PU-ERH BEEF NOODLES It wasn't even the green noodles that we get at the other Tenren locations (shouldn't all franchise locations have the same menu?). It was just plain noodles which weren't very good either. Soup base was sooo oily.We proceeded to ask the waitress about the noodles but her response was that only the Highway 7 location had the spinach noodles (Which is not true because other locations provided this dish with spinach noodles).Will not return.
237;We've ordered from Fort York Pizzeria several times and have been pleased with the quality of the food.  I placed an order for delivery on Friday night and received a confirmation email letting me know the pizza would be delivered within 35 minutes.  An hour later there was no pizza and no one answering the phone.  I checked my credit card and they charged me.  I called and left three messages asking that they reverse the charges.  No one called me back.  I assume they decided to close early on the long weekend and didn't close their ordering system.  Totally not acceptable to not call me back and to take my money without delivering a pizza.  Now I need to dispute the transaction with my credit card company.
238;I just ordered a ham and cheese pizza and vegan lasagna. Pizza Hut as better pizza without a doubt.
239;The worst pizza I have ever had.  Tried the buffalo chicken.  Not much flavour and I could have counted the pieces of chicken on one hand.Frozen pizza tastes better.
240;Think of the worst pizza place you've ever been to. This place is 100x times worse. Delissio over this garbage any day.
241;OK I know I am reviewing McDonalds but....The staff/service is so slow I feel like I should be giving THEM food. And are they running a fight club out of there? There is always a brawl. I am going to have to find a new place to go to shame eat. Sigh.PS Bring back McPizza.
242;This is probably the worst service Ive ever had at McDonalds. There was a huge line yet there was no sense of urgency. One person was making the sundaes and mcflurries. Needless to say, it took forever. By the time she finished making 8 sundaes and mcflurries, half had melted. The topping for the sundaes had a terrible, funky taste to it. To top it all off, the young lady taking our order was rude. I dont expect much from Mcdonalds but give me a break.
243;This McDonalds is located at the Queen west - King west - Queensway and Roncesvalles intersection so there is some traffic but most of the people are just passing through. Being a McDonalds, it serves excellent crappy food from chemical-rich manufactured animals which then get pureed and reconstituted into a fried patty. I do stop by here from time to time for their small coffee and muffin combo. The muffins used to be quite fresh, but recently I think they use frozen ones that turn into a rock within hours.
244;This is the worst service. I have ever experienced. Extremely rude customer service, only muffins and coffee available at a 24/7 location, and totally inept staff.  Absolutely unacceptable. I will never go back, and I am appalled at the service I received.
245;I have been to this McDonald's in the heart of Corso Italia (@ Dufferin and St. Clair) a few times... And boy, let me tell you, it's the worst McDonald's I have ever experienced. Why?  The service is so ghastly sloooow!  There is always a long line of irritated customers. The best analogy I have for how slow this line moves is the attitude that Patty and Selma from The Simpsons have with their jobs at the DMV, "Some days, we don't let the line move at all. We call those weekdays."  The army of staff behind the counter does not translate into fast service.  The staff aren't motivated and they seem to always to be set on "chill" mode. I have even seen them argue with each other in front of customers. What's even worse is that this location doesn't even serve the Fillet-o-Fish!  Instead, I got a Big Mac this visit which I suspect has gotten smaller in size than years past. Nothing could salvage my experience today... Not even the fact that Monopoly is back!
246;The worst mc Donalds of all time all of there employees should be fired every single one , lazy lazy people the manager too busy trying to pick up all the lil school girls coming in I never seen a mc donalds so bad have had hair in my food numerous times then I complain and get a free meal then I had to blow up on them jus to get it
247;Horrible drive-thru service. Absolutely stunned workers. Line ups 20 min wait.Brutal for fast food. Not even worth a star.
248;Where to start with this one. I have no problem with McDonald's at all but this one is just horrible. I went there on a Saturday morning at 7am and this place was still closed?!!! The elderly wanting their coffee and wanting to sit down have been waiting since 630. Most McDonald's open early and this one none in sight.I have no problem with teenagers working their but they seem like they dont want to be there and have the worse attitude when it comes with customers. They make the lines wait like crazy.The bathroom are just the worse.NEVER NEVER NEVER TAKE KIDS TO THIS BATHROOM. They have boxes for the druggies can put their needles and its easy for lil kids to grab them. My son asked me what there for. This is bad and unhealthy..The crowd of druggies surrounds the front and picks fight with the customers and none does a thing. I got into a fight with one because he was trying to take my sons happy meal toy. Truthfully the best time to go is around 730am from monday to friday where its mature peopl
249;THICKER THAN PEANUT-BUTTER IN THE FREEZERWow, I thought Wallmart highered the biggest idiots born, but I think they are actually all employed here. At least I hope they are all here, because it would suck if they decided to work elsewhere and spread their disease. I hate this resturaunt. I've gotten a wrong order here more times than anywhere else in the world. In the world. ...in the world. Theyre slow as malasses at the cash register too. Shame, I love Burger King,This place should be quarantined.
250;The food is never great and today they got 90% of my order wrong. Tried to call and complain, not picking up phones for an hour. No voice mail set up to record the complaint. Now they can add another 1 star review to their slate. Yes they have not improved since 2009 it seems.
251;I used to enjoy BurgerKing and it was my top pick out of all the fastfood burger joints. But when I entered this place one time after a long day and just wanted a quick bite, never again!!!! All there food was so oversalted that I had to spit it out again, specially the poutine! Never again am I entering foot into this location or for that matter will avoid BurgerKing.
252;The only reason I go here is because it's the closest fast food dispensary within walking distance. Having said that, I still try to avoid it where possible.The service always seems to be slow even though there is never really much volume and the clientele consists primarily of Sheridan students.What I find redeeming about BK is the daily meal deals which used to be $3.99 but have recently jumped up to over $4.
253;I come here every time I crave cardboard or food poisoning. It's close to Sheridan, so if I ever feel miserable in school, it's there to remind me that there are worse things out in the world. Also, they only give you one pack of sauce instead of two when you get the 10 piece nugget deal, making it hard to mask the taste of recycled newspaper. At least it's cheap though so I can clog my arteries and waste away while still having enough to pay for rent.
254;I have been to this place twice and every time it's been a massive disappointment in quality. Once the chicken was undercooked and the other time it had no taste. I mean it's chicken shawarma, how can you get it wrong? I do not recommend this place to anybody.
255;So I've been debating whether or not to write a scathing review of this place as it just opened up.  I understand confusion while you open, but rudeness is just not tolerable.  Here's the story - I went back on the 2nd day.  I went to order 3 items.  Two shawrma's and a Tabolueh salad.  I see them make the shawerma's, and although small, they looked good.  No issues so far.  But then I ask where my salad is - the lady serving me says "Tabolueh - this one".  I look at it and all it is is cucumbers and tomatoes and there's no parsley and nothing is chopped up??  Did she seriously think because I was Asian that I didn't know what Tabolueh was? Here's the kicker though, the owner says "no Tabolueh today" and is basically trying to shoo me away.  I was practically this guy's 1st customer.    So anyways, now I'm at the cash and I have 3 items and the owner goes "two items only" and I say "I'm picking up something for a friend" and instead of saying "3rd one is regular price", he says to me "I don't care, two item
256;Previous reviews have it right on the dot.  I went there for some good counter service before enjoying my evening with my boyfriend.  The guy behind the counter messed up our order and instantly became quite rude.  He then insisted that we pay extra because of his mistake after our transaction had gone through and had spent over twice as long waiting for his fish to come out.He tend refuses to hand off the food that we have already paid for.  The whole experience got highly confrontational.  I suggest everyone AVOID this place.  Go somewhere else unless you want to be treated like garbage because the guys behind the counter can't get your order right.
257;BEWARE. Pretty sure I got food poisoning from this place. Wasn't thinking right when I walked in and saw how dirty the place is - should've ran.
258;The Pickle Barrel at Promenade Mall has got to be the worst Pickle Barrel of the whole chain--it is almost an embarrassment to the brand. Don't get me wrong--I love Pickle Barrel. I swear by the Rose Reisman's warm chicken spinach salad, however, this location has left a sour taste in my mouth all of the times I have been there. Where can one even begin. I will start with hygiene. It is dirty. Tables are not cleaned right away, and there's dirty dishes lying around everywhere. For the full two hours that I was sitting down, no one cleaned the tables beside us. And the restaurant was pretty much empty. Where are the bus boys? They were clearly there, but obviously, no one is working. The floor is dirty. There's garbage everywhere. How can I trust that the environment which my food is being prepared in is even clean?Which brings me to my second point--horrible service, horrible management. The waiters are lazy, not to mention unprofessional. Two waiters had a full out five minute conversation IN FRONT of us
259;Charged by York Region Health Inspectors for "operating a food premise maintained in manner adversely affecting sanitary condition"https://www.yorkregion.com/community-story/7317374-dine-safe-york-health-inspectors-close-thornhill-deli-charge-2-other-eateries/
260;Guys please ignore this review if you like slow service and average food. Now for the people who want to know how this Pickle Barrel "Promenade location"  rates according to me. This restaurant needs more waiters, also the door greeters need an attitude adjustment. It seemed that they were bothered upon my presence. I had a humus chicken wrap, it was lacking flavour, I had to add salt to it at every bite. The soup wasn't that good either, the chicken tortellini needed something, oh yes a little flavour.  I hate giving negative reviews, but I'm afraid this time I must once again!
261;Had to walk out of the place. Came in for a nice meal with family so we could discuss life among ourselves. Within 5 minutes of being seated, the TV set volume was substantially increased making it a distraction. After a request from the waiter and then discussion with the manager, it turns out that not only is Pickle Barrel a restaurant, but is now a sports bar. It is corporate policy. If I wanted to eat at a sports bar, I would went to one. I am a long time customer of the restaurant and have used their catering services for several large events. But now the relationship is broken, likely for good.
262;Greasy fish and chips.  Cold steak on the Caesar.  Probably not made fresh to order. In attentive service.  Horrible experience.  But the kids pasta got a thumbs up from my kid.
263;AWFULL !! I have been here 5 times to meet family who found the location convenient. Every time the tables and food was greasy and not in the greasy spoon good way.Be prepared for a server that showers less than once a week!! Gross.Last complaint, when a restaurant has a menu with 300 things on it, the odds of your choice being fantastic are low.Avoid, avoid, avoid!!
264;Horrific.I've never ever not finished what's been served to me.  Streak ended.Do not get the fish tacos here.  Like highline fish sticks dipped in batter on a bed of bagged salad on a cellophane-grade tortilla.  Impossibly terrible.The absolute worst meal I've ever been served at a paid restaurant.   I suppose that's worthy of some sort of award.  Or at least a free embroidered vomit bag.The waiter was great.  That's the one saving grace.  Otherwise I would have been telephoning Yelp HQ trying to figure a way to give them a zero ranking.Yes.  It's that bad.  I can only imagine that elderly people flock here to hasten their inevitable demise.  Euthanasia via portion control. The single worst place on earth I have ever eaten at.Repent.  The end is near.
265;This location is in my top five for worst restaurants on the planet. My masochistic tendencies mean that I am a repeat patron at this establishment. One recent visit with 8 other family members, stands out as a particularly terrible experience. So let's start from the beginning. First, we get sat in the front of the restaurant, which is notoriously understaffed. (Come to think of it the entire restaurant is generally under staffed) We ordered starters including bruschetta, and a bunch of different salads. The bruschetta wasn't so much bruschetta but rather tomatoes of salsa consistency with bread sticks that I guess you're supposed to dip into the supposed bruschetta mix. So we sent that back because it sucked. Fine, we screwed up and probably didn't read the menu right. Then onto the salads. My dad took a few bites and then noticed that the lettuce underneath was moldy and slimy. GROSS. As previously mentioned they were grossly understaffed, so after a hunt for the server we sent it back. We also ordere
266;Everytime I come here, I instantly regret my decision. They manage to screw up the simplest of orders. The latest being my wife ordering a sandwich with a soup as her side. The waiter brought it on the same plate and spilled all the liquid on the sandwich making it soggy and gross. I ordered an eggs Benedict and I ordered the eggs medium-soft. They came so well done, that they were practically chicken!!I don't understand how this franchise is still in business. The food was a lot better when it tried to mirror itself as a Jewish style deli. Just give up!
267;I keep on trying with the hope that one day the service will get better because they have a pretty extensive menu that isn't half bad but man, the service absolutely sucks. Everyone is pleasant enough, we haven't experience any true rudeness but if you don't mind waiting 45min in an empty restaurant this is the place for you.  They are constantly understaffed and overwhelmed which constantly results in slow service and you'd better hope that you have everything you need and your order is 100% correct because good luck getting your server to come back and check on you. This place is super close to my in-laws and it keeps getting suggested and we keep getting disappointed everything we come. (Written waiting in line at another restaurant after being told they couldn't seat us (with plenty of empty seats) because the servers were overwhelmed)
268;This location has got to be hands-down THE WORST one out of all of the locations I've eaten at...and well I've been to most of the ones around the GTA because All-Day Breakfast is my weakness and when you work in malls, PB is usually the only place where you can get that anytime you crave it T_TI love eggs. I can actually make them almost every style...except for the expensive one..what's it called? I can't remember. Anyway, I always get their 3 eggs any style with the sausage and latkes and toast. When I order my eggs a certain way, I expect them to be made that way, since I'm paying so much more than a carton of eggs FOR THREE EGGS MADE THAT WAY. [sorry I'm just reliving the moment when I ate my eggs from here]They were still raw. Like, the stuff was still clear and gross. I'm pretty sure over easy you're supposed to have fried both sides and only the yolk stays a little runny.Anyway, I learned my lesson for the next time and told them exactly how I wanted my eggs. Unfortunately, this translated to: 
269;Called them from Detroit a month in advance to make a reservation for a party of 10 for Sunday brunch. Arrived early and checked in with hostess. The rudeness from the get-go was jaw-dropping! While acknowledging our reservation, we were told "We have nothing available and have no idea how long it will be." It went downhill from there. We were seated more than an hour after our reserved time. The service was abysmal at best. The food was mediocre and cold. Some of us were almost finished before others got their food.  While the manager offered 2 free appetizers in view of our wait, it was almost an hour after we were seated before that arrived... are you getting the picture? We had to repeatedly request coffee warmups. I could go on and on...suffice it to say, it's a good thing our focus was the reunion with our Toronto friends. We plan regular such get togethers, but they won't be at Pickle Barrel. What a total and profound disappointment! Shame on you!
270;I wish I could give this place zero stars. The server was obnoxious, didn't know the menu, couldn't answer a simple question about what comes on the burger....The lettuce in my salad was wilted and disgustingThe fried pickles were a mess with brown lettuce underneath The burger was burned, had no sauces and the waitress gave us a disgusting attitude when we asked if they could put sauce on it. It came back with a frikken pesto sauce on the bun....
271;This. There's no way I can let this one slide. Signed up for Yelp just to post a review of the Promenade Pickle Barrel location. I have been here (reluctantly) many times over the years at this location but tonight this is the last straw for this abysmal mess.There's nothing good about this location. Understaffed and poor service is the name of the game. Servers go on breaks on a whim. Food that sits on the pass for 10-15 minutes. Always have to send a cold plate back. It's a real shame.The other locations throughout the city are OK. Pickle Barrel in general is very mediocre with a large menu and subpar servings in quality and serving size.There's nothing else to say about this location. Avoid.
272;This was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. After waiting almost 40 minutes for my lunch, I found a strand of hair in my sandwich. The waitress and waiter were so unfriendly and hostile that it made me and my family feel uncomfortable. The food was not good and I will never be going there again. Although we tipped the waitress 20% she did not even give us one smile.
273;Apparently, they have a different standard on medium rare. This is the worst steak I've ever had.
274;Not coming back again.Food comes to your table cold , salty and tasteless. Kids grilled cheese came cold with horse carrot and a dark spoiled celery stick. The fajitas are overpriced for the microwave grade meal. Not sure if the salsa was actually a tomato sauce...lettuce is low grade iceberg type  Friday evening , all families with kids are dining and they play WWF on the big screen- Very inappropriate!Service was alright, similar to Tim Hortons. Overall experience is bad, will not recommend.
275;Horrible food, horrible service, there is nothing left to say except find somewhere else to eat, and don't waste your money on this place !
276;Can I please give 0 stars???I have been here MANY times and usually had a not bad experience but this time was AWFUL AND I WILL NEVER RETURNI ordered the greek chicken souvlaki which came with a greek salad that had tons of rotten lettuce so I asked for anotherThe next one had the same amount of rotten lettuce and soft veggiesIt was GROSSAnd when I asked the waiter to just take it away, she seemed annoyed and angryI'm sorry that I choose to NOT eat your rotten lettuceThey didn't offer to take it off the billService was RUDE and each time I come here, the service and quality gets worse and worseI'd just avoid it!
277;Worst experience so far. My family and I sat there for 30 mins waiting for the memu. Horrible horrible service. I would never come back
278;Probably the worst Pickle Barrel I've ever been to! I am a big fan of the Pickle Barrel at Yonge and Eglinton, but not this place! First of all, our server was not attentive at all. The napkins he brought to our table had stains from previous customers *gross*The utensils were not too clean either! I had to ask the server to bring me a new set of utensils because they were not washed properly and rest assure that I, by no means have OCD!We wanted to have our salad with our meal, but the salad came first. So, we finished it, because the wait for our main course became too long and we were starving. Finally, I got a big plate of shish kabob, but some of the pieces were burned and the rest of it did not taste good. So, I ordered some lemon, so I could at least make it edible. The waiter brought the smallest piece of lemon possible!! I just couldn't wait to get out of the restaurant and write this review for everyone to know and avoid this restaurant!
279;I don't like Pickle Barrel to begin with.  The food is boring, bland, and no matter how they dress up their restaurants it is still a sub par chain restaurant.Out of all of the PBs, this one has got to be the worst one of them all.  I was with a buddy a couple of weeks ago and we were hungry but nothing else in the neighbourhood was appealing, so we decided to go to PB only because we knew what we were going to get....we were wrong.1. We arrived and had to wait for 5 minutes (no exaggeration for the hostess to arrive at her post.  She arrives holding a cleaning cloth!  First, a hostess should be at her post or at least close by so she can greet the guests!2. The dining room looked like a tornado went through it.  With all the staff around, you would think the place would be efficient and spotless.  The place felt greasy.3. Our waitress was nice, and calm while all the other staff looked frazzled and running around doing every job.  The hostess was seen clearing tables and taking plates into the kitc
280;Revamped pickel barrel. Looks much more upscale inside. Tight seating inside. They placed too many tables which partially block off the entrance to the patio area. I was a bit peeved when I asked for a table of four and was told I would need to wait 25 minutes before I would be seated. There were several large tables that were free with no one seated. I was eventually seated. And those tables around me were still empty. Our server was nice, but not exactly the sharpest of the bunch. Our food was served not all together, so some of us got our plates sooner, but our server did not bring any cutlery for some of us to start eating. We signalled for him that we needed cutlery, but he wanted to take someone's order first. After he took the other table's order, he proceeded to walk to the computer, and enter that table's order in the computer for like 10 minutes. Like wtf, go get us our cutlery, our food is getting cold. For a second I thought he didn't understand us, because who in their right mind would contin
281;service here was absolutely dismal. Came here for breakfast and no one was there to seat us, and this while witnessing several servers just pass us.When we finally got seated we waited for around 40 minutes for a sandwich and french toast. While waiting, 3 staff members where just chatting around the bar probably just to stick it to you. When our orders finally came, the fries were stale. Like Mcdonalds fries left on the table after a day. In other words, barely edible.We asked for some butter and the server, without even glancing at us says "be back in a minute". She never returned.  The worst thing about this meal is that I still had to tip something. Uggh.. It's one of the worst places I've been to in recent memory. I will not return which is unfortunate because the menu was pretty good if they only stuck to the service and food standards they were supposed to adhere to.
282;There's waiting in line in a Fed-Ex, and then there's this. Test the limits of the human condition, today, now for free at a McDonalds made entirely by satan himself.
283;Worst McDonald's ever. The staff here really don't give a crap they are the slowest staff I have ever experienced. It's not for a lack of staff either, there's always plenty of staff when I've been there. They just seem to move at a glacial pace. There is always a line up, but they don't seem to care.
284;The staff here are terrible. We came in and made a large order and they just couldn't stop arguing with us. The line got so long that the people behind us starting complaining. The staff responded with very sassy tones, disregarded their complaints, and reminded them that the "kiosk is there for a reason."It's one thing to argue about a large order that is placed, but it's another to disrespect another person, let alone YOUR CUSTOMER(s). Although the order that we placed was made very swiftly, I will not be coming back.
285;The shittiest McDonalds in the city.The people who run this obviously don't care. Why not? There's plans to knock down the plaza and build condos.The service here is reprehensible. They rarely get the order right. Its damn near impossibe for these people to even get COFFEE right.There are countless homeless people who come in to bother customers, and they do nothing about it. There are vagrants who hang around the front of the restaurant, begging for change, coffee stickers, etc...and some will even go into the garbage to fish out a cup, or leftover fries.Very often, during the night, the restaurant will look like a garbage compactor threw up. The staff have absolutely no pride in their work, as it shows with the condition of the restaurant. McDonalds is supposed to be a family restaurant, but the music they have on in the background is hardly family friendly. I would never let kids listen to top 40 music, especially with the uncensored nature of the lyrics.If they're short staffed, they need to h
286;Thank God I don't eat McDonald's food but I truly love their coffee so when I'm working in the area this is the McDonald's where I have to get my coffee fix- so three times a week at 1:30 PM I walk in and there's two cashiers working and a lineup of people a mile long waiting to be served- isn't 1:30pm still considered lunchtime ??? it just boggles my mind and it's so frustrating waiting for large coffee to go  to be made by six people behind the counter chatting laughing giggling and not doing much of anything. But I need my coffee fix I have no other choice so I will stand their roll my eyes secretly and wait for my $2.00 coffee.
287;Absolutely the worst McDonald's I've ever been to, and I've been to a lot. Drive through took 25 minutes and when we got to the window they didn't have our order. We had to wait another 5 minutes at the window and then they got our order wrong. The staff doesn't know what they're doing. They even forgot to take our money. Unreal.
288;It's so dirty managers have attitude staff are slow and not focused on customer service
289;Wow, worst wait ever.  Went there at 3 am and waited in the drive through for 25 mins.  I know I was late, but if you can't get a quick burger and fries in less than 10 mins in 2017 - then you slippin, McDonalds.
290;This place is absolutely disgusting. I have never been so repulsed by a restaurant. When we walked in, the place was like a barn. There were used spoons, cups and cardboard containers near the drink fountain and ketchup dispenser. The garbage bins were overflowing and many tables were dirty. I know  should have complained. I also know that people are not going to stop going to this Mcdonalds but I certainly hope someone who has authority that works there is reading this. Very disappointed.
291;Waited 1 hour for my 2 combos in the drive thru. The manager is absolutely useless. The employee started swearing at the customer at the window because he's stressed out that 10 cars are waiting 1 hour for their cheeseburger and fries and chicken nuggets. Worst McDonald's in the district and won't be coming back again. The district need to replace the manager because this restaurant is a mess. By the way. Notify the customers in the drive thru before they order that there's an issue with the kitchen or you will take 1 hour to make fast food so customer can drive away and order from another McDonald's before their vehicle is stuck in drive thru.Also, tell your employees to not use the F word with the customers in drive through.
292;I was served a frozen junior chicken here, and I complained to head office, and it has been SIX MONTHS and they still haven't done anything about it! I could have gotten food poisoning and it just seems like they don't care! I know it's McDonald's and I shouldn't have high expectations but at the very least I expect this gross excuse for an attempt at a meal to be at least cooked! AT LEAST thawed! The only reason I even are that much of the sandwich was because I was driving in downtown rush hour traffic, and I thought the cold stuff I was eating was just McChicken sauce...
293;I like the idea of their summer promo.  $1 for any sized pop or iced coffee.  Cool!  I love a good deal!  Plus, their vanilla iced latte is a high calorie (so bad...so good) yummy beverage.  Or so I thought so. I was at work and just finished drinking the iced coffee I got from this McD's drive thru.  I had literally just thrown the empty cup in the garbage.  My coworker comes in and says that she just got an iced coffee from this spot (from their drive thru too) and it had a cockroach in it.Mmmm....iced coffee, now served with cockroaches!  Is that's why it is so cheap for the summer?!
294;The worst run McDonald's ever,  usually go to these places to gain weight but I felt I lost it waiting for 30 minutes for 2 mcflurrys. Don't train new staff at peak times and stop closing up an hour before your restaurant closing time is scheduled. Poor staff and poor management
295;I would give no stars if i could... they're supposedly open for "24" hours but they CLOSE at 3am to get ready for breakfast which starts at 6am? I don't see why they need to close the restaurant for 3 hours to cook eggs and sausages when they're supposed to be open 24 hours and if they do close for 3 hours prior to the actual breakfast start time they should have unlimited supply for breakfast and yet people have to wait for them to make our food cause they have to cook more... false advertisement? I mean they do have a huge 24 hour sign there for a reason...
296;I love McDonald's and this location is the worst I've ever been too (Canada or US).Last night I got in line in the drive-thru and tried to order a salad (No Salads- at all). Ok, I'll have a filet o' fish (No Filet o' Fishes), ok, well I'll have whatever you do have. When I got to the cash, I asked if perhaps I could get a coupon to make the next visit a little better since nothing I wanted on the menu was available. The cashier reluctantly said yes, left for a few minutes, then came back and said her manager said no. I got the food home in about 5 minutes and it was entirely inedible. I like McDonald's a lot, but in this case, Burger King across the street would have been a better bet (Burger King!!!). Insanity. Horrible.
297;The local Mickey D's. The one everyone in the hood knows and goes to. If you were a kid growing up in Parkdale you have at least one story about this place. You probably came here for some kid's birthday party when they offered those here. The old ball pit was probably where you caught your first contagious childhood virus (Probably why it's not there anymore). A nerd growing up? You probably got your lunch stolen here once. This Mcdonalds is in the lower spectrum of Mcdonalds the world has to offer. The place is dirty and smells of pee. All day, everyday, the tables are sticky or just plain messy. The service is pretty bad since you'll probably be served by a bunch of teens who probably forgot about the "fast" in fast food. The food? Well you should know what to expect. It's not like this place does things different when it comes to the Big Mac. Yep, there isn't much to say about my local Mcdonalds. It is of course, just a Mcdonalds.
298;This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. The customer service was terrible. Not one person smiled nor acknowledge a friendly welcoming. On top of that there stingy. I ordered a chicken and beef. I got nothing. I could go to a grocery store and get a whole chicken for what I paid for. Don't go here !!! Waste of time and money. The employees need to get laid or something
299;Worst service ever. Staff is so rude and have no manners how to talk to a customer. We ordered falafal combo( it said 4 falafal with salad, pita and 2 sides), however we were just given 4 falafal with little salad and one tiny side. When I said it says 2 sides, he said rudely salad is considered a side. After I paid, they gave it to us with no pita, so I said it says pita comes in combo, that guy and a lady standing there made weird face, and gave a cold wrapped pita. I paid $10 for the meal, and the portion was so small. More over falafal was so dry and cold. Never going back to Villa Madina again. Please avoid going here. They don't even deserve 1 star. Worst experience ever.
300;Portions are incredibly small, It won't fulfill you. I order a mix plate so I can get a decent portion, but it is never enough. Supposed to be Beef shawarma plate, not rice and salad plate with sprinkles of beef on top. Never again
301;Worst place for quick Mediterranean  food. Staff is rude and judgmental. Portions are small. Falafel is dry. Salad is soggy. I won't ever be back.
302;Very bad place to go eat. Staff is extremely rude and have no respect for customers. Chicken shawarma tasted awful. The worst I ever tried. Very unpleasant experience. Very dry chicken that you will scratch you throat. Portions are very small. Stay away from this place!
303;If I could give it less than 1 star I would. These people are stingy !!!! They make a big deal about giving you the pita with your meal. The beef is old and hard !
304;This is my second time here and honestly if I could give this less than one star, I would. I ordered the beef shawerma and it was so chewy and cold plus the entire sandwich was 95% sauce and lettuce, barely any beef. So disappointing tbh
305;I used to look forward to coming to villa Madina for their generous portion sizes, however today i was totally wrong when I went to the square one location! The amount of chicken shawarma they put on my plate was enough to fill up a 5 year old kid, not an adult, it was like two tablespoons of chicken sharwarma, it's the smallest serving I seen in my life, the sprinkle of chicken looked like the garnish, I've been eating this type of food for 10 years so I know what's an decent portion of meat, this did not cut it, its fucking ridiculous! (The chicken sharwarma was on a monday special for 8$  plus taxes) totally over priced!! It should have cost 5$ tops...I asked the cashier if this was a kids sized meal?.. she said that's their policy for the serving portions, bullshit!! I used to go there and get so much I couldn't even finish the meal, I actually had to go to Mr Greek to get a pork souvlaki to make up for Madinas pathetic chicken portions...  other customers who ordered wraps were also ripped off,  their wr
306;Very poor service from the staff and the food was disappointing. Will not be returning.
307;I get that this is airport food...I get that there aren't a lot of options... but this is bad bad bad. Here's how the experience goes: you place your order at the cashier. You stand and wait 20 to 40 mins for them to get to your food (while listening to everyone around you complain). Periodically the preppers will cough on whatever they are making. Some people will leave to catch their flight when they run out of time.When you get you food it is limp, overcooked, and oddly seasoned. Make sure you don't deviate from the menu (e.g. ask for no broccolli) because you'll get a giant huff and a glare.In the end, I'm not sure my beef was even beef and after eating my stomach hurt worse than when I was hungry. Honestly, you're better off leaving and eating nothing.
308;Really hard working staff making very sub standard food. Thai express needs to up their game. This food doesn't represent Thai food. It's just a sad waste of time.
309;Wish I would have read the reviews before I ordered food from here...arghhh! Ordered the Chicken Thai Fried Rice. Didn't know it came loaded with onions. Four, count them four pieces of 1/4 inch wide Chicken shavings, really?... The rice was overcooked and lumpy. I can cook better rice and faster. Waited 20 min for my food. Never again!
310;I tolerate the service here when Im really hungry but there are instances, like tonight, where the service simply isnt worth the warm food. First of all, there never seems to be a standard of where to order food - sometimes it's at the counter, and sometimes at the register. Tonight, it happened to be at the register though, like most times, there was no indication. After having waited to be served for 5 minutes, was directed by the cook to order at the register which, at the time, was unmanned. There was a younger girl stocking shelves and another older woman just talking to her, but taking no real interest in the fact that there was a customer. I walked over to the side she was closest to and waited a few minutes before they decided it was a good time to stop their conversation long enough to tell me to walk over to the other register. This could have stopped here. Instead, as Im walking over, she takes someone else in front of me! Was clearly annoyed and her colleague noticed and offered to take me, but a
311;Worst Thai Express I've ever experienced. A fast food place that isn't fast at all. There's always a back up of hungry customers waiting for the slow staff. The kitchen is filthy, disorganized and the staff seem to just be staring off into the distance rather than paying close attention to what they are supposed to be doing.
312;I got on yelp because the Thai here was not so good. It's unfortunately the worst Thai I've ever had. Sorry.
313;Habituellement très bien mais le service est très mauvais. Il a fallu 15 minutes pour mon saute, ce qui prend habituellement 4 minutes. L'organisation est pourrie.
314;My daughter awaited the opening of this place anxiously for what seemed like forever! As we drove by one day last summer my little girl spotted the door open and begged me to go in. To put it bluntly and as honestly as I can my NINE year old  wasn't impressed! The anticipation that grew waiting for the 'Marshmallow Factory' to open fizzled away as to both our amazement they didn't even offer freshly made marshmallows! Instead they offer marshmallow cream, (think marshmallow fluff you can buy at just about any grocery store) and an assortment of mass produced vessels such as cookie cups and cones that you can eat the marshmallow fluff out of. The place also sells very over priced marshmallow confectionary imported from the UK. If you're looking for freshly made organic marshmallows or anything FRESH you should probably skip this place. If its expensive unique imported candy you seek just walk a few blocks to Sugar Mountain or Suckers! My daughter and I both were very disappointed.
315;I thought the place looked fun and all but I was disappointed with what I actually got. The "marshmallow" looked nor tasted nothing like marshmallows. I liked my chocolate toppings and my sugar cone but it wasn't anything special. It was very small for such an expensive price. I love marshmallows and I think this business would do better if they actually had a "fluffed" marshmallow maker instead of just goo in some container.
316;I ordered a "12.99 appetizer &quarter chicken& side deal ". Came out to being 15.99+. Than I waited at the drive through for over 15 mins And I ask for whole wheat bun. And they gave me white AND THE APP WAS AN OILY GROSS SPINACH DIP WITH STALE CHIPS AND WHEN I WENT CONTACT THEM ON TWITTER THEY IGNORED ME. disgusting never go there. Swiss chalet is a rip off for how much food you get. Espically how my family orders from them so often they don't even respond there customer service is repulsive
317;Tonight was the third time I have eaten here and the third time I have not enjoyed the meal. Tonight I ordered a 1/4 chicken, white meat with baked potato. Easy right?   After waiting 1/2 an hour I received a 1/4 chicken dark meat. When I moved the skin back, the chicken was not cooked. Trying to get the attention of the waiter was difficult. He finally took the plate back, replaced it with the white meat, which I had originally ordered, and new potato. Now I had no fork or knife. Had a further wait for cutlery.  This time I will not be back. No fourth chance!!!!
318;If I could rate something lower than a single star, I would rate this zero. I've been to Swiss Chalet approx. 15 times and have never sent food back. Today, I had to.Two of us wandered in and I ordered a quarter chicken white meat, with fries. My dining companion ordered the roast beef on a Kaiser. We waited a normal time frame for our meal to arrive, but when it did, I was totally grossed out. My chicken was pink on its edges....and when I peeled the skin back it was completely off-putting. The meat under the skin was mottled pink...blotches of red and pink mixed across the top of the meat. I was totally grossed out. Not sure if it was still uncooked in spots, or whether it was a very poor quality cut, but it was totally gross. I'm surprised a staff member would even bring it out as you could see the colouring even without peeling the skin back.I flagged down our server and she came over and had the gall to say "all our chicken is cooked thoroughly". I told her that I didn't care...I wasn't eating it and 
319;Came here on what I thought was going to be a slow night. There was about 12+ tables, all of which had a range of 2-10 people. There was one hostess and one waitress for the whole restaurant. I ordered a classic chicken dinner. Took way longer than usual to get it. Once I did, I was to find the chicken was undercooked. I politely asked the waitress to recook it. The just gave me another one. They said that the next one was on the grill and "well done". As I start tearing into this chicken, I come to find it was also raw 100% in the middle. Not okay, all they said was "it happens all the time". I love swiss chalet but very disappointed in the way this was handled.
320;extremely unhygenic toilets both mens and women's. just wondering how the kitchen would be !service is  very slow.
321;Kfc chicken sandwiches are total rip off nor longer chicken pattie, just 2 small chicken strips. As for the kfc chicken recipe has been changed not so great anymore. Better off going to mary brown's chicken, a & w chubby chicken, any type of rotisserie chicken. Very expensive ain't worth it. Highly not recommend.
322;Absolutely Horrified by my experience there today!It was my mothers Birthday Dinner request to have KFC, why of all places I will never understand.To have the employees GIVE our food to another woman in line to then have to wait was ridiculous.To then have the employees IGNORE our frustration.BUT top it all off, to have the employees persist to tell us everything from in our order was in the bag, not once, not twice, but 5 FIVE TIMES.They forgot the extra chicken, then the coleslaw, then our FRIES. WOW.To have requested extra napkins and plates before we ordered- to have to go back inside to pick them up.
323;I'm giving Centro 1 star based on a few factors - 1 being that I couldn't actually try the food which is in addition to the customer service being non-existent. Also, I would give it a zero but it seems Yelp won't allow it. To explain, I found a coupon book in my mailbox this evening with one that included a deal for Centro. By the way, there was no special deal, as the website listed the same prices. Knowing nothing about this place, I turned to Yelp for some customer reviews as I normally do. The reviews were not awesome but they also were all based on experiences actually visiting the restaurant (slow service, that sort of thing). Given we were looking for delivery, I thought we should give this place a shot and order delivery. Bad idea.As soon as I called, the person who answered responded "where do you live, we only deliver to Scarborough." Ok, fair enough (if the customer is seeking out a delivery option). I assumed that delivery would be fine, considering it's not that far and mostly because 
324;I am giving this restaurant one star because I have called for delivery and I have not received my order. Couldn't even call them back because the restaurant at the time was already closed. This isn't the first time this happened where I did not receive my order. If I had known my order wasn't going to arrive, I would have called pizza pizza because I'm sitting here STILL waiting for my damn pizza when I've ordered it almost an hour an 20 min ago. I understand they say that it would arrive in an hour but I've been waiting for far more than that and I'm sure Im not even going to receive it. AGAIN.
325;The food wasn't good at all. I mean, I ate it because I was hungry but I didn't finish the white rice.. It was gross. My sister and I got there and they thought they had food but the didn't, so we had to change our orders completely. As we were ordering & waiting, a woman in the kitchen was scaling fish over the garbage. Now, every Caribbean person knows we either scale the fish over the sink with a bag or the garbage with an empty bag.. Anywho, she dropped the fish in the garbage and her face said it all. She called over another woman who was working in the back with her to come and pretend that she was searching for something by her. When she realized I could still see she "quietly" asked her coworker to shift her body so I couldn't see her pulling the fish out of the garbage. The thing is, I saw EVERYTHING. They couldn't fool me. The only thing good about this food stop was the ice cream I got. Their curry chicken just needed a little salt.. Curry should never have to be salted by the eater once it's cooke
326;I went in tonight to try the Double Down for the first time. They were out of the cheese that normally comes on it so they were making them with Kraft Singles. Seriously! You could see the guy making the sandwich unwrapping each individual slice of "cheese". Despite having four people working tonight the service was extremely slow. The cashier had to go talk to the food preparer after every order for some reason. The cashier didn't get my order right, though it was to my advantage. I wanted the Double Down and a drink, but not the combo. He charged me for the sandwich but no the drink and still gave me a cup.The worst part of the experience was that there was a guy eating a piece of chicken in the food prep area.  I'm not sure if he was on break or what was going on but that shouldn't happen. Totally disgusting.
327;THEY NOW CHARGE FIVE DOLLARS - $5 FOR DELIVERY !I'm sorry - in case you can't believe it - you are now being GOUGED five bucks (plus almost a dollar in tax) to get delivery of this poisonous food.So about 6 bucks in delivery, and what, about a 4 buck tip - that adds TEN DOLLARS to an already expensive meal.I'm going to go throw up now ...
328;Well today, I got my 2nie tuesday for lunch, got back to work and the chicken was pink and a litle bloody inside. I was absolutely horrified because I thought KFC had cooking protocols. I will never visit this location ever again because I dont want salmonella or E.Coli, thanksp.s - their cooks obviously dont know what they are doing because isnt chicken their main dish??? WTF
329;Horrible service. Lady who served me was rude and incredibly ignorant. Food is over priced and moderate in taste. I've dined at this restaurant a few times and encountered the same poor service each time. i will never be returning and would strongly recommend an alternate Italian eatery for any one who wishes to eat Italian food.
330;I came here about a week or so ago. I would not return. They were very empty at the time and that can usually go one of two ways. 1. You get served really quickly and the food is excellent because they have a lot of time to devote to your order OR 2. You get served really slowly because the staff are goofing around since they have so much spare time and they don't realize they ran out of certain food items until long after you've ordered because they haven't been paying attention to the inventory due to all the fooling around. Unfortunately I had the latter experience. The staff were very much enjoying themselves. Kitchen staff kept coming out into the dining room to try out special drinks the server/bartender (she was the only one in the dining room) was preparing for the staff. There was a lot of chitchat and joking around between the staff. Food preparation? Not so much. Some of our order was unavailable and we were informed long after we placed our order (the substitutions that were made were not good
331;Avoid this location.  Absolutely terrible.  Ordered the smoked platter, took over an hour to come to table and when it did it was cold and meat was dry. Could not bring myself to eat, sent back. Will never return.
332;My salmon was overlooked, the veggies and rice that accompanied the salmon were cold, the martini I had came in a dirty glass, the coffee I ordered was Coke and the apple cobbler came without ice cream.
333;Just finished rib and chicken combo with my bf and it was not so good. They gave us a half filled mash potato dish and both meats were dry. Definitely not coming back to this location. Location on the queensway at islington is awesome. They know how to keep customers returning. Stay away from vaughans montanas it sucks!!!
334;The service was very slow and messed up my order multiple times. I ordered a 10oz steak that was medium and it came to me rare. Very disappointed in Montanas.
335;First off...sat in the Bar area.  When I first arrived, (6pm) my friend had ordered drinks and an appetizer. Looked over the menu and made a choice from the "seasonal" menu insert. Server came to take order and said they were out of the cob of corn that came with the ribs. Now, you would think for a seasonal dish they would not let that happen. However...ordered a:"10 OZ HAND-CARVED STEAKA 10 oz Petite Filet Steak, lightly smoked, grilled to your liking, then hand-carved and served with Crispy Cajun onions, choice of beans or coleslaw and choice of side." Well...according to the aforementioned description...it is "grilled to your liking" and THEN "hand-carved".  However, mine was carved first and each piece cooked. Now I'm sure if you have ever tried to cook steak cut into 8 pieces individually and cook it  medium... you will find that its practically well done and very chewy, lacking flavor because you're cooking the pieces not the actual whole steak and then cutting it. Needless to say very disappointi
336;Ruined my daughters birthday by going to Montana's in Vaughan. Before I go on... the server was great!  After placing our orders the food took 45 minutes to arrive.  The server came by to let us know that the Manager was going to come by to talk to us about the delay, "as they pride themselves on having food on the table in 15 mins"...OK that sounded promising.  I saw the Manager hovering around the restaurant but not once did he come by to talk to us.  While we were waiting, an elderly couple got up and left before their food never arrived, they were tired of waiting.  They had the right idea!  When our food arrived some items on the plate are cold and some are hot!  Wow terrible.  My sweet potato fries were hot but not cooked.  Then the server comes over to let us know they are going to reduce our bill by 20%....OK that's somewhat reasonable!  Apparently they can't do math either because the amount they deducted was also incorrect. It was Saturday night but not busy at all!  I will never return to Montana's
337;Would never eat here to begin with just wanted a drink on the patio. Patio was empty and took a seat.  Was told it was a 35 minute wait for a drink and we had to leave seat.  Never again.
338;Quite frankly, absolutely one of the worst dining experiences of my life.We visited tonight (Saturday) and the line up at the door was massive. Thankfully one of our group had made reservations so we walked right in and were seated right away. This was at 7:30pm.Victoria, one of the servers, approached our table and let us know right off the bat that the kitchen was backed up and that food would be "slower than normal" coming out. She took a drink order, returned about 5 minutes later then left. Another server, by the name of Jenny came over and took our order.Well...we waited...and waited..and waited. Went through all our drinks...they were replaced...and waited.Finally, our appetizers came out at around 8:45..over an hour after our order was placed. They were lukewarm, disappointing and tasted a bit stale.Our entrees didn't come out until well after 9:00pm....my fajitas were sizzling, so they were ok. One of our party ordered a Caesar salad with the steak bites as their meal. When the salad came out, s
339;Do not go to this restaurant!  After placing my order and waiting almost 45-60mins I asked the server what's happening to our meal. After the manager came out, I found out that they forgot to place the order.
340;So Montana's Vaughnmills. Some of the most horrible service I've ever seen in my life, regardless of understaffed environment. Seated at 5:30 :Took half an hr to get a waiter to come get our order and it wasn't the waiter. It was the manager I presume since he was wearing a different plad-coloured shirt then the rest of the workers. I've seen better service at a Chinese restaurant where they don't speak English. Brings the appetizer about 10 minutes later, it's saucy. Forgets our utensils. My god I've never seen such... Stupidity. Takes another 5 minutes to get a waiter around to grab their attention- debated whether I should get up and start doing service myself.Ordered at the same time as the appetizer. It's been an hour. --- post status: been reading reviews on yelp etc and I've seen many who have suffered under the time management skills of Montana. I want my god damn food already. It's probably going to be disgusting but I just want my fucking food. Should've went to teppanyaki's across the street
341;Food is poor and the service is somehow worse. Th atmosphere is nice but that's about the only plus.
342;No smile. No hi how are you. No how can I help you.No sashimi on the munch menu, no items from the grill on the lunch menu. And the food is very mediocre.Not recommended however it's the only sushi place in Bradford I think, too bad because if any other place opened up would be better than here
343;They've been closed for renovations for awhile now. I guess they decided that all the coupons that they distributed in the area would cost them too much money so they closed shop under the renovation pretence. Coupons have now expired so they'll probably open back up soon. Too bad for them we found another sushi place that is much better and cheaper (and no added automatic tip).
344;There are warning signs in life.  A dog with the hair on its back standing up... A wisp of acrid smoke coming from an electrical outlet... The guy with the tinfoil hat and the hunting rifle...The place was packed on a Friday evening, and I was able to get a deuce by the front door, complete with a sticky surface.  Warning number one.I should have known better than to forgo the All-You-Can-Eat sushi for something off the menu, but I wanted good sushi--not a carb loading.   I saw a lot of "white tuna" on most selections, which should have been my second warning.I ordered the Sushi Fall combination, and substituted the white tuna (I hear there is no such thing as white tuna) for salmon.  The meal started with a standard Miso soup and a lettuce salad with what tasted like a salmon dressing.  OK so far.The sushi platter was a shock.  Each piece was a handful of rice with a wallpapering of fish tissue on top.  I then realized that ordering off the menu at an AYCE means they likely just make up your special 
345;First time at the place. Price is a bit expensive, maybe ok for a sushi.Food is ok, some very tasty.The grade is most related to the bad service. Even the manager/owner is not so nice. We just moved to Bradford, I told my wife it will take a long time before I try again.Better gead to Newmarket to get a decent japanese food.
346;This used to be my favourite AYCE sushi place, even with the horrid service. Now, the sushi rice is drenched in rice vinegar and incredibly mushy. The fish has an off taste and smell to it. What you order is NOT what you get. I ordered the enoki mushroom beef roll and not only was the mushroom substituted with asparagus, but the meat was almost charred and tasted like dog food. The miso soup was cold, as was most of the hot items. As for the service, it's always been absolutely horrendous - food constantly forgotten or the wrong thing is sent to us, the waitresses always act and look like that absolutely hate you and wish they could be anywhere else. The lovely cherry on top? They add a 10% tip on your bill no matter what. When we brough up our complaints, we were met with the traditional AYCE sushi response: our food is good, you don't know what your talking about. Gotta love those responses before being forced to pay for food that gets you food poisoning.
347;I've been here a few times now and the food is pretty good.  However, the staff don't speak very good English and are very unenthusiastic to clear your plates and take orders.  Some of the servers smelled like marijuana today which I find very disappointing.  Although I enjoy the quality of food for $11.99 lunch special I won't be back due to the staff and the drugs here.Don't forget the bill includes gratuity.
348;Akita Sushi was dIrty, sticky menus, unfriendly to the point of rude waitresses AND poor quality sushi... don't waste your time with Akita Sushi... make the drive down to Newmarket to Golden Maki on Leslie, worth the trip.
349;The food is flat out terrible! Please don't subject yourselves to the torture of sitting in this restaurant.
350;The food was awful, the service might be worse. They didn't even bring me half of what I ordered, definitely won't be returning.
351;I am what I like to think a sushi expert. This restaurant is very dirty. The waitress' are very rude and they bring you wrong dishes. I once had to wait 15min for wasabi major disappointment !!!!
352;Today, 4 of us went to have a nice breakfast, we've been before and it was good. Sat down, served by a young lady Sabrina today. Greeted us with a sour face and rushed look.. Took drink orders. Took over 10 mins to come.  Then took food orders.. After 35 minutes waiting, I politely asked if she had an idea of how much longer it would be and she replied "I really don't know" whilst annoyed look in her face. Patiently waited another 15 minutes and out it came...We asked for more coffee and some white vinegar. 10 min past and we politely asked the other server who had a long ponytail braid for the vinegar and within 1 min brought it out with a smile. Sabrina came back and we asked for the coffee again and she said (with an annoyed look on her face), it's on its way, then came after 5 mins..Meanwhile her other table of 2 were served and left by now. I totally understand if it's busy or short staffed, but what I have a problem with is when the sever hardly acknowledges you and doesn't give any reasons wh
353;Went there on a Thursday for the all you can eat wings.... I'm not sure what's in the sauce, but all I could taste was a very strong flavour of vinegar. Wasn't for me, I won't be back.
354;Used to go there all the time when we lived in own. Wife and decided to go get some wings see if they were as Good as remembered... well.. they were okay.. probably the best part of our dinner.. 2 cups of coke was $10.50And than upon water found out they were supposed to charge for that as well... Won't be going back.. Servers were non existent.. and staff seemed disgruntled.
355;Worst bar ever with dumbass security. Security seem to think they are all tough harrassing you and accusing of stuff, meanwhile i wonder they even got a high school diploma. Hope these dumbasse all get fired.
356;Ordered take out through Just Eat - all good once opened had bugs fly out of every container. Would not eat here again.
357;Too bad there isn't a zero stars option. Absolutely the worst experience ever!  I ordered a pizza on a Monday  (can't imagine it was too busy at 11pm) and still it took over an hour for it to arrive. It gets better. I peeked out my balcony window to see the delivery driver having a smoke and casually chatting on his cell phone. After about 5-7 minutes I finally receive a buzz from downstairs and I proceed to let him in. Another 5 minutes goes by so I open my door to see if he's lost on my floor. He's still chatting on his cell then looks up at me and says "oh, hey". I pay for the pizza and tip generously despite the poor service. When I opened the box I discovered the pizza was stone cold. The cheese had hardened as if it's been sitting out for a few hours. Quite disappointed I called the main number and they were quite pleasant and offered me a free pizza which I accepted. Now fast forward a month later. I placed an order to which I assumed would be complimentary. The young lady that I spoke to immediately j
358;OMG - Just don't order from them!  Ordered pizzas for a staff meeting at 11:15.  At 12:10 received a call from the driver - "I'm at your door."  No you are not I said ( video cameras)  "Yes I am"  NO YOU'RE NOT.  He was at some other location - not the address I gave them over the phone.  Here it is after 1:00 pm - no sign of the pizzas.  Manager called and offered a 10% discount on the 2-hour old pizza's  REALLY? .  If you want to ruin your day, afternoon, night, party, get-together, staff meeting - these are the people for you.UPDATE :  Finally showed up at 1:40 offering a 10% discount for the pizzas that we ready 2 hours ago.  Staff had gone home so no pizza no lunch.
359;Ok, I have HAD IT with this location thanks to the rude, young European girl behind the counter (there are two that I have seen here, I'm referring to the more scowly of the two). It's a shame because my kid loves it here and it's close to home.I really don't like to point out people's faults unless they're blatant (such as this occasion and my previous review below about Mr. Stinkpalm). This "woman" has a constant scowl on her face so she's easy to identify.I was in a few weeks ago and asked for two medium pepperoni pizza specials. I asked for them "lightly done" since my young kid has a hard time with overdone crust. It even shows on my bill (see the pic attached). Well they came out very overdone. I went to the counter to show her and she REFUSED TO REPLACE THE PIZZAS.  I really didn't feel like waiting anyways so we ate it how it was. I sucked it up and decided not to announce my displeasure with a review update.But today!!! I took my young kid in for a quick slice and fries. My total came to $5.02.
360;Was extremely sick after eating a slice of deluxe pizza. It was late at night and the slices were probably sitting out for a while. Used to order from here only because how close it was to my house. Was never satisfied with their pizzas, always soggy crust even when asked for well done. After the food poisoning I will never eat from this place again!!!
361;My service was TERRIBLE. I ordered a cheese pizza. Instead, he gave me a pepperoni pizza. I politely asked the manager to receive what I ordered, so he made a new cheese pizza. By this time, all my other pizzas were cold. According to the company's policy, I should receive the pizza for free if it's not ready within a certain time frame. So I asked the manager to give me the pizzas for free after waiting an extra 30 minutes...Did he? No, of course not. Instead he argued with me. No free pizza. I paid full price for cold cardboard.
362;Yuck.Cheapest ingredients, worst pizza sauce in Ontario.. Maybe north America.I'd walk a few blocks down the street, better options!
363;This is the worst pizza pizza.....my pizza was under cooked. I went up to show them this as u could clearly see it had only been warmed at most.The very rude girl at the front said " No, its not under cooked....if it was cooked anymore it would be burned ".There wasn't even one part of the slice that was brown...Why have people handling the front if they don't know anything about customer service!
364;This is by far the worst location. And that's really saying something considering how crappy Pizza Pizza is even at its best. The pizzas always seem slapped together with all the toppings piled right in the middle and hardly any cheese. Better local options include: Il paesano, 850° and Pizzaiolo
365;Yechhhhhh. I had chicken fingers and glad I did because the bibs, leaky plastic gloves, olastic ans styrofoam dishes grossed me out. When our large group left, the table was a mound of garbage. How does "boiling" and then serving seafood in a plastic bag make it any better?
366;Absolutely disappointing. Went in for the lunch lobster roll combo, along with the $16 lobster. Lobster came first before the rest of my parties food. Fair enough. It was tossed onto my table in front of me in a clear bag. Interesting but a terrible experience. No utensils to help navigate my food leaving me to use my hands (which were in plastic gloves that were give to you). Overall the lobster was okay (about 1 pound), but I would NEVER pay the original 42$ listing price. The lobster roll combo was pathetic. The lobster bisque was some gravy, with a gram of shredded lobster placed in it. It tasted below par at best and would simply never get it again. Then came the actual lobster roll, a small laughable amount of lobster spread on top of bacon. It was so pathetic that I refused to eat or pay for the roll as I felt robbed. All in all, we paid for our meals (out of the ones that we actually ate) and vowed to never return. FYI: the fountain drinks were not free refills and my party and I went a few doors down
367;Sign says open.  Not open.  Still hiring and waiting for their liquor license apparently.   The suspense may kill me....
368;Let me start by saying that I love the pizza and service at the Adelaide store and if it wasn't for them, my experience at the York Mills store would ensure I never went to any of them again.Last night, I ordered three pizzas, a 13 inch gluten free (horrible - tasted like nothing), a medium honalulu and a large vegetarian. On the latter two, I asked for olive oil and garlic. First of all.. 68 bucks plus tip! So of course, I expected quality.The large pizza was completely covered in the kind of garlic you buy in a jar. I love garlic but I found the amount unbearable. Garlic was all that we could taste and after a half a slice, I started to feel sick. There was at least a tablespoon on every slice!!! It was not possible to scrape it off because garlic is sticky when warmed. The honalulu had only a tiny sprinkling... So clearly this was a mistake!My partner called the store and attempted to politely explain the situation, expecting, since the store was closing, a credit for the one pizza we couldn't eat. T
369;Online the price was advertised as lower than what the in store price was. They refused to honour the advertised price."Deep dish" is just double crust.
370;Service was bad. Don't go to this location.We specifically asked for no hot banana peppers on the Brando. The guy refused to write that down. And we ended up with hot banana peppers on the pizza.The whole conversation was very confusing. Just not customer-friendly.The Brando was actually good - maybe I would go to a different location for that one.The other one on the gluten-free crust was disgusting. It was like eating a bunch of toppings on a giant, stale cracker. Another lesson learned.
371;I generally love Swiss Chalet! The chicken, ribs and gravy are an quick and easy dinner solution. The service at this location was not very good. I ordered a half chicken dinner and the chicken was very, very dry. It was like they had kept it on a car engine or somewhere else that was warm  and uninviting overnight somewhere so that it could be served the next day. The experience has me turned off from eating any Swiss Chalet for a long while. In hindsight, I think I would have been better off getting breast meat and warm sides from the supermarket across the street.
372;Two recent experiences here have been pretty bad.  On one occasion, my order took extremely long and was given to me after two other patrons who had had their orders taken after mine was taken.  My order was one breakfast wrap.  Not a difficult or large order.On another occasion, staff overcharged me.  When I asked the staff about it, they informed me that they had charged me the correct amount.  When I pointed to the screen with the menu and prices, the staff admitted they were wrong and a Manager had to adjust the price.
373;Just terrible they kept on messing up my order and when I tryed to tell them they messed up my order  they acted like I was wrong. If you want to go to mc donalds avoid this place
374;Made a mistake of stopping here because my friend was too tired to turn around and go to the other side of the road and it was definitely a mistake.Gross seating area, dirty washroom and the staff punched in the wrong thing (who eats chicken at McDonalds??).Wow definitely go to Harvey's across on Yonge. The burgers are better and of course it is cleaner at Harvey's.McDonalds clean your joint
375;My God this place has horrible horrible horrible service !Go to the lakeshore location if anything they are also a little slow but atleast competent and bearable.This place messed up my order and then took 45 minutes to bring me my bill on top of the hour and a half they already wasted on trying to fix my order which they never did.
376;This was terrible. My 5 year old brother could have made a better crepe than the garbage they served me!! Waste of my money!
377;Such an overly expensive place for no reason, they charge $6.99 for a marshmallow? You gotta be kiddingThe "freshly baked" cookies were days old it seems, and the 1 inch width slice of cake was over pricedAnd on entry the cougar waitress greeted me in an awkwardly flirtatious way.
378;Can't eat here because all they serve are animals heavy dishes. Get with the times and start offering vegan breakfasts and lunch options.
379;Service here is extremely poor. The place is so poorly managed, the employees are everywhere. Visited this Dunk n dip location a few times and all those times the service is still bad. They either don't seat you, don't give you a menu or don't give you utensils... i've even experience a time where they don't even finish letting our table pay. The waitress ran away after letting half our table pay and they went to cash out another table. Dessert here pricey and is a hit or miss. The gelato here is pretty good but sometimes the gelato has sugar bits inside. The gelato sometimes tastes really grainy.Save yourself sometime. The place is really unorganized. It's better to go somewhere else for dessert.
380;I was really excited to see a new dessert place in mississauga when existing locations haven't impressed me much. My excitement however was short-lived, although the place is decorated really nice and we had a really nice server, the food was way too expensive and unfortunately the quality and quantity did not justify the price. I have never seen a banana split for over $18! the lonely banana came with the icecream scoops so small, it can put Baskin n Robbins kid scoop to shame! Will definitely not be returning to these money hungry owners!
381;Came to Dunk N Dip with my family for a nice sweet treat after a day at the park and I was disappointed to say the least. The service was terrible, and so slow. The menu items are very open priced. I ordered the speciality crepe, and it was mediocre. Crepe got cold very quickly. All in all, I will not be coming back
382;The lakeshore location is way better! This one treats customers like shit and makes the deserts differently. Don't order your food and desert at the same time. If you do they will put your desert in a fridge. I told the waitress to bring our desert after our food when I ordered. She confirmed with me before leaving our table. Then the first thing put on our table was desert and I told her I had told her I wanted it after our food. Which makes sense like come on! I'm usually really patient with servers but then she started giving attitude and treating me like I had caused the  issue. She asked me if I wanted it put in the fridge. Lmao who does that? To make matters worse her manager and her are pointing physically pointing at our table and at my family during this whole ordeal. So I'm trying to keep my cool and stay patient. We had to ask for water 5 times before we got it. Once we finished our food and asked for our desert she took 20-30 minutes to bring a desert from a fridge!!! When I complained to the mana
383;Food was average! They forced us to have a sparkling drink and chocolate dipped strawberries that we didn't want as justification to the $15/person policy!!!Dirty glasses when complained they took them back whipped them with a dirty cloth!!Don't recommend at all!!
384;SECOND VISIT Came here again to give the place another try. However the service I received is still the same. The waitress here provide horrible service. Besides getting my order wrong they are still very disorganized. One thing that bothered me the most is the fact that when we were ready to pay the lady comes and cashes my friend out and then tells us that she will be back. But she ends up going to the other table to let them pay for their bill.. like how can you just leave to cash someone else out when you're not even done with cashing out one table. That's very rude and people don't have time for you to partially do things and make them wait ... We asked for the bill first and when you started servicing us you should've finished our table and then go on and do whatever you need. But even after she finished cashing the other table out she didn't come back to let us finish paying. We had to call her over again. Horrible experience ever. Never coming back. Avoid this location. Go to Port Credit!
385;Walked in, nobody greated us except for the open kitchen staff seated us in this rather isolated spot. So isolated that none of the waitress saw us. After about 10 mins one of the waitress finally saw us and handed us a menu.  After another 20 mins my boyfriend gets up and ask if they could take our order. Another 5 minutes before the waitress came and the place was half empty! Anyways the waitress wasn't very happy and she inisted we should use this lamp thing (sort of like asian restaurant door thing). But seriously how am i suppose to know? Food was a bit overpriced. Asked for water, nope nothing.
386;Went once and it was not very good and my over easy eggs were the same colour as my toast. T&D burger around the  corner is much better
387;Gross!!!  The breakfast had no taste to it at all. Way better places out there.
388;Dawson's was busy but I don't know why. The owner (I assume) was not warm or friendly at all. He was pretty surly as he pointed us at the free tables and told us to pick one. Our servers seemed to be playing musical chairs. One to take our drink order. And then we waited. One to give us our drink order. And then we waited. One to take our food order. And then we waited. One to serve us the food. The food wasn't much better. Pancakes were heavy. The bacon was soft (ick). The eggs were super greasy. The potatoes were mushy. Everything just tasted MEH and BLAH and OILY. Surly, scatterbrained and meh does not equate to a winning equation. I'm not coming back.
389;An early day out we decided to hit Dawsons for a breakfast before we took on the day .The place is small but has seating for about 40 people.It seemed to be a good place to go judging by the lack of parking.The tables are all "ikea-ish" four seaters (no booths) that feel like the hexagon bolts are in desperate need of that little tool or allen key tightening. The service is odd... No one seems to be able to commit to one table, a waitress for cutlery,one for coffee and yet another for taking your order, now this wouldn't be a bad thing if the sequence was at all flowing and not sporadic.The food that takes a very , very long time, doesn't taste fresh at all and is either over cooked (eggs rubbery) or under cooked (raw potatoe). I believe in supporting the "small guy" but I hate to admit it... going to a franchised place would have been a better choice. The owner was collecting the cash on the way out... didnt ask how our meal was, but I felt compelled to inform him of the experience and his response w
390;I don't drink coffee so I came in for a breakfast sandwich which they managed to screw up the order after I repeated myself 3 times! I guess customer service sucks at all Tim Horton's locations!!
391;Haven't witnessed such a lack of regard since the Timmy's at sherbourne & Richmond's levita. Ordered a smoothie, it took at least 12 minutes in there. They shouted out lemonade smoothie and no one responded. Then this small cashier gave the drink a once over again and shouted mango pineapple.  Twas mine.  I sipped it all the way to the subway platform.  I realized there was no yogurt in the drink and returned to the Timmy's.I told them it was not made properly and I felt a large amount of sass from the lady who made it. But what was she even upset about? Making me wait so long for a poorly made beverage that I paid $4 for??? Lady, U can keep your sass to yourself.  I'll keep my twoonies.This Tims is really slow, only go on lunch break when u get 1 hour away. Don't go unless Ur  at gunpoint
392;this location is what I would call, rough around the edges. inconsistent service leads to angry customers at times, and on some occasions when I have gone here, some of the machines are down, including a time when more then one was down. the bathroom is almost always left in shambles, and the waiting area is showing its age, even though it just went through a recent renovation. the staff are not to friendly at this location either. just not a very impressive location carrying the Tim Hortons name. transit friendly, but no parking at this location.
393;This place has no consistency. Burnt! And no olive oil!
394;So an update after my little ordeal with Pizza Pizza...So they message and call me offering me first a gift card to 'compensate for the amount i paid and then some more'. I find out it's a $25 gift card. I told them i had no problem with their offer but would still like an apology from the CEO of Pizza Pizza. They ignore my comment and have someone call me to get my address.Then a few days later someone calls me and offers me a $50 gift card and ask for my address. Still no comment or update regarding my request for an apology from the CEO of Pizza Pizza.I then get another call from the district sales manager stating he will send me Toronto Raptors tickets. He gets my address with no apology or update regarding my request for an apology from the CEO of Pizza Pizza.I receive the $50 gift card in the mail with a letter... and of course the letter says nothing in the lines of an apology. The letter says:"RE: Your Service ExperienceFurther to our discussion, thank you for contacting Pizza Pizza. We at
395;Pizza is hard to mess up but they did it anyway! Uneven crust thickness and little sauce... Plus unfriendly service...
396;My girl friend and I stayed at this Radisson twice and were given continental breakfast vouchers on both occasions. We didn't have time to take advantage of it the first time but we decided to give it a try on our second visit.The moment we walked into the restaurant  was like going through a time machine. Boy~ the decor was immensely outdated it felt as if we had just gone from year 2010 to 1980's...The experience pretty much went down hill from that moment and on...1. the waitresses were not very attentive at all even though we were THE ONLY table.2. The continental breakfast only included the cold section of the break (breads, fruits and croissant...) but we chose to to add $6 for hot buffet because the croissants and fruits had obviously been left for several days (no jokes, the croissant had a kind of fermenting smell to it) and spoiled. 3. Fine... so off we go to the hot buffet (the selection was very LIMITED) but we thought how can we go wrong with $6 buffet? WRONG! The scramble eggs was blah
397;The Fox Bistro is the restaurant at the Radisson so we were assuming that the food would be fine and gave it a try as we had a coupon for it.As you walk in, the first thing you notice is that it is very dated inside, and the bar crowd. We were the only table in the whole place besides some people staying at the hotel watching the world cup and having some drinks at the bar.The menu is very simple, not big at all. I wasn't very hungry so I just got a club house while my other got the lasagna. The waiter wasn't paying any attention to us at all, he was busy watching the game with the guys at the bar, we had to keep getting his attention. If we were the only table don't you think he should of gave us just a little more attention?When the food finally came, I saw all these yellowish looking stuff on my sandwich, the description said mayonnaise NOT HONEY MUSTARD SAUCE! I dislike mustard and I was shocked to see honey mustard all over my sandwich, I have never seen a club house with mustard on it, so I was 
398;I'll eat anything. Don't get me wrong. I love great food. But I'm also not super picky.This was terrible. Awful. First of all, breakfast isn't hard. But it was for them. The buffet seemed lackluster so I ordered eggs Bennie. It's kind of my "treat" when I'm traveling. I was informed a little after I ordered I couldn't have them because they were out of English muffins and ham. It's Thursday. Really? So I opted for the buffet. The hash browns tasted rancid. That made me fear the eggs. They actually tasted okay. But by then I was put off. The bacon was half cooked and so greasy. And the sausages - well at least they were cooked through.The muffins were stale and the croissants were undercooked (hint: they shouldn't be white).I felt bad for the server because she seemed aware everything was crappy. She was at least quick to refill the coffee (which wasn't terrible).I wasn't expecting 5 star dining but this was ridiculous.
399;This was one of the earlier restaurants to get the new makeover, and though inside it looks good, there are quite a few migrants here who are pretty aggressive, plus there are serious problems on how this place is run. STAY AWAY and spend your money elsewhere.The people here are completely the worst, I can't honestly pick if it's the staff or the troubled youth that stay here all day. Staff here barely get orders right, and even if they do, you get shortchanged or get graced with their half assed effort. I always get fish filet, end up having the cheese on top or outside of my sandwich 80% of the time here. I was nearly pick-pocketed here by the migrants that frequent this place, but I had my wallet chained to my belt loop and scared the kid off when I looked over. Some of my other friends get sexually harassed here constantly. Management does nothing, neither does corporate, completely useless wastes of life.
400;What nice things can I say, the outside looks nice. Everything else downhill. Customer service, smell, kids hanging around doing nothing. This McDonald's sucks.
401;Avoid this place at all costs. The food is disappointing. Also, the owner (manager?) regularly blocks the bike lane in front of the shop to unload food items from his car. It's not only illegal, but dangerous to road users. Besides, the car looks very dirty on the inside. I wouldn't want to eat anything that has been transported in there.
402;Do Not Eat Here: I eat anything, but this?!?!Paid $19 for a can of Coke - 1 small fries - And a "Philly Cheese Steak". I waited 20 minutes, and then got this:1 great tasting coke. 1 small haft froze box of McCain-ish type Fries. Dry yet soggy. Had a freezer burned taste to them. The sandwich: Where do I start? The meat? Dry, old overcooked, then reheated in microwave. The meat had a gray like appearance. They put some odd raunchy tasting sauce on it. Guessing to hide the dryness. The cheese tasted like nothing. I looked to see if it was there. It was, in colour only. They put mushrooms on it. The mushrooms where gummie-bearie. I thought it was a pencil eraser, same kind of taste and texture. They also but some hot sauce on it. Maybe Sriracha Hot Chili, which I like but not on this. I eat out A LOT, I've had many Philly Cheese Steaks. Here in Toronto (home) and in the USP. I've never written a negative review, I've had many bad meals. This wasn't just prepared and cooked badly, it would taste horrible ev
403;Really tiny portions, overpriced and mediocre tasting. I got the grilled chicken sandwich and took over 10 minutes to make while being the only customer there. Paid over $10 for a burger and drink (not even fries!) and was not even close to full. The whole burger was maybe an inch thick from bun to bun.
404;Just paid almost $10 for a sandwich with hardly any meat or cheese. Waste of money...wasn't filling at all!
405;Decided to eat here since I was working nearby at an event. I also had a $5 off coupon when I visited their stall at the CNE. The sandwich as the CNE was decent and quite big so I decided to give them another shot. Boy was it a mistake.I should have read the yelp reviews beforehand. I had to spend $10 to get $5 off. The large 8" sub with combo was $14 with tax. HOLY....that is expensive for fast food. I am so lucky I had that $5 off or I would be steaming! The sandwich was so so so SO SO SO tiny. It was a children menu size and I got the big 8"! I ate it in two bites. I wish I wasnt exaggerating. The sandwich was so pathetic it looked almost paper thin. There is no height to this thing. Toppings were all there but the thin bread made it look so disappointing. The fries were standard fare. The kind you can make at home. The only redeeming factor were the two nice students working there. I feel bad writing this as I am helping to get rid of their jobs. I hope this place closes down. It is suppose to ser
406;Love Philly cheesesteak so thought I would give this place a try.  While it wasn't terrible it was no a Philly Cheesesteak.  Very little cheese or onions. No peppers.  Light on the meat.  Bun was very fresh and the food tasted ok. But maybe advertise as a grilled meat sandwich.  I won't go back.
407;This is not just a bad review, its a warning to hopefully avoid people from getting sick. Note I have eaten at other Thai Express locations in the past. In 29 years, this is single handledly the worst food experience I have ever had. Not just eating out, food in general. I ordered golden curry (which was served with frozen vegetables, imagine a bag of green giant mixed frozen vegetables). About 5 bites into the meal I almost ended up putting a huge 3 inch piece of chicken fat in my mouth. I was so turned off I returned the dish to the franchise owner. This is the first time in my life I've sent something back. The dish was replaced with Pad Thai. The beef in the Pad Thai was the lowest quality beef I have ever eaten. It tasted like it had been soaked in 3 day old cooking oil. My friend tried a piece and immediately gagged. 30 minutes after eating this piece of beef and we both feel like throwing up still. In 15 minutes 3 other customers each returned their dishes as well... each time because the foo
408;Farce. Ordered tofu pad Thai which was then given to another customer. When I told them they'd done so, they made another one in less than a minute. The noddles were undercooked and there was chicken in it. I told the girl who blankly stared at me and attempted to tell me it was egg. I don't know which came first but I know the difference between a chicken and an egg
409;Expensive and slow. For a chain this location doesn't seem to meet any consistent standards. And there is nothing more frustrating than restaurants that have basics on the menu but then don't offer them. Shrimp or chicken cold rolls are a basic that any self-respecting Thai restaurant carries but not this one. Disappointing and have to stop coming here completely.
410;Pricey, the cooking area is kinda clean. There is a hand washing issue here! I'm sure the wok kills most of the germs but there is defiantly a sanitary issue here. Won't be back to chance fate. Be warned.
411;I wouldn't recommend this place at all! Food is was a nightmare! My husband ordered chicken noodle soup, it's more like a pickled noodles! They put tomatoes, cucumber, parsley, and shrimp! Taste like vomit!!! And the chicken wings is more of a "pepper" chicken wings! No flavour what so ever! And the fried rice was just fried with tons of soy sauce! Spring rolls were just the wrapper! No meat! So disappointed for $35 meal!!! Will never ever go back here!
412;I always get a stomach ache after eating here. I don't think they keep their food clean or fresh. Many of my friends say their stomachs feel uncomfortable after eating here too
413;In the words of today's teenager: 'I can't even.' After a fail attempt at getting a table at Marcello's, my boyfriend's sister suggested Wild Wing as an alternative given it was within the same plaza. With a communal indifference to the dinner option after our blunder, we agreed. The warning sign should have been how empty the restaurant was with a single patron sitting at the back of the restaurant working vigilantly on her computer and nursing a beer.  The lone waitress didn't greet us, didn't nod an acknowledgment and didn't seem to give a rat's that we were there. Despite this, after deciding on a table, we sat ourselves down and patiently waited for the lone ranger to wander over. 10 minutes later, she strolled over and handed us three menus with a half assed greeting. Now, it's a no brainer: you come to a chicken wing place, you get something chicken related. However, I'm weird about touching my food and without fail, will always vote for the boneless option. So, you can imagine the gut sinking feel
414;Wings at this location after just bad.  They  taste like frozen wind from Walmart.  For a wing joint that cagers to the wing connoisseur, theit wind are the worstDo yourself a favor and go one block north on Jane St to St. Louis Bar and grill.  These wings are way better.Try even Buffalo Wild Wing just down the street.Just don't waste your money here.
415;As soon as I walked inside this restaurant, I could immediately smell the mould in the basement. I wanted to go downstairs to the washroom, but the smell of mould was so overpowering it made me sick.  I don't know how a restaurant can be open to the public in these conditions, and I am concerned for the people who work there, since they are exposed to this toxic substance.  If you have any respiratory problems or are allergic to mould, please don't set foot in this place.
416;I bought a chicken shawarma plate (~$10) and it didn't taste good, the rice was weird, the meat was undercooked in some places and burnt in others (I had to throw half of it away). But the place looked cleanish and the people were nice. So, I don't know if it was just one bad experience or what but I won't be going back there.
417;Worst Ali Baba place in Toronto..bad quality food, small portions and teribble customer service.Waste of money and time
418;Low class portguese food. Smells like a sewer. Avoid at all costs! Steak is done one way- medium and thats it. They use Nesquick Sauce as a topping for the desserts. Go anywhere else!
419;Save your money and spend it somewhere else!This place was recommended to me by Portuguese, but it's far from authentic &  delicious Portuguese food that I am familiar with. What a dissapointment!
420;Really slow delivery and almost no chicken in the three dishes we ordered. The green thai curry is nicely flavored and really creamy but that was the high point of an otherwise bland fast food thai experience.
421;Part of my order was missing. There were hard inedible bits in Some of the dishes. Everything was WAY too Sweet. Large lumps of chicken fat. No balance to the flavours at all. Greatly overpriced considering the quality. This is like the Mcdonalds of Thai food. Dont bother and never trust the Just-eat rating.
422;Visited this site 3 times with Groupon.   Site had poor customer service and the food to match.  I will never eat at this restaurant again.
423;Last visit. Ever.Another groupon and one more chance - methinks I'm done here. 1. The order - devil chicken, extra spicy, no sweet peppers in it. I repeated this request 3 times. The result - 1/5 of the food container was loaded with dry hot chili peppers. There were bits of sweet red, green and yellow peppers in the food which indicates to me that food is not made from scratch as they claim but rather pre prepared and someone must have removed chunks of unwanted peppers. Ridiculous amount of chili peppers made it impossible to eat - I mean I like my food spicy but there is such a thing as powdered hot chili! After I put aside most of them there was not much to eat left.2. As above - not much to eat. First couple groupons there was a generous, heaping portion of food - yesterday there was hardly half of container: mostly dry chili, lots of onions, two small pieces of broccoli, 3 tiny pieces of baby corn, few stripes of chicken swimming in a sweet sauce. 3. Unfair practice number one - without groupon you 
424;I was hoping to get Lucky this time...   As it usually turns out, no such Luck.No Beef. Fine. Curry Chicken please.  Chicken stewed-beyond-recognition.Curry Sauce below standards, eek.Laksa, Lacks-a-lot. Identical Curry used.
425;Most disappointing curry I've ever had. I got the lamb curry and asked for extra spicy but instead they gave me what seemed like water with oil and pieces of meats. The lamb was tender but when drenched in the curry sauce, just tasted like water. The rice was also cold and tasted old (it was hard). It came with 2 pieces of broccoli and bits of vegetables. Even though it was cheap ($7.50), it was most definitely not worth it. The only good thing about this place was the chrysanthemum tea, but you can get that anywhere. The girl at the cashier was also clipping her finger nails.... Totally unsanitary and disgusting.
426;Where to start?  Was really in the mood for some hearty pork bone soup but their neighbor was closed for the day.  The boss lady said they have good curry beef brisket so I gave in (ok. I was starving and needed some food).  The presentation was not very appetizing.   A scoop of rice with very watery and oily curry sauce with 3-4 pieces of beef (me.  Too fatty) and 2 boiled pieces of potato. .. that was whiter than an albino snowman. Which was also crunchy...The rice had many uncooked/dry prices inside and the sauce was warm at best.  The soup du journey lacked flavor and a cup of non-vintage H2O would have been more satisfying.One more thing, make sure they give you the correct change as they provide no receipt. Most of the customers complained they were off by a bit.
427;I ordered a chicken skewers... The chicken is so raw that it can almost jump out of my plate. The lady still try to convince me that it's okay BC apparently no blood coming out from a pink chicken is OK!!!I will come here again when I am ready to eat chicken sashimi with curry.
428;The curry chicken was underwelming to say the least. Besides the watery sauce, the chicken was flavorless and resembled the pork bones used in Chinese soups. The potatoes were also stale, and the roti was rubbery & oily. I'm pretty sure they just fried up a frozen one from the mart. What a waste of $7+.
429;Will not order from this pizza pizza of any pizza pizza ever again. Quality has really gone down the drain over years. Just ordered a large whole wheat pizza with chicken pineapple olives and hot peppers and the whole wheat tasted spoiled like it's been sitting there for a long time same with the pineapple. Had two slices and it made me so sick to my stomach I had to throw out the entire box. Never again. So disappointed.
430;Chain restaurants are a different animal. You go there for consistency, basically. The quality is what it is, and it's always going to be roughly the same at every location.You can't realistically compare them to anything except other chains serving the same type of cuisine. Even then, Pizza Pizza is probably the worst choice you have. Unfortunately, I was running errands in the area and really needed food.I walk in, knowing it won't be great or even good, but it's edible and both closer and cheaper than my other options. A poster on the door informs me that they're doing 2 slices for $5 about $3 too much for the taste and quality but not completely abysmal.I'm looking at the menu inside and seeing no indication of the 2 for $5 combo. I'm vaguely aware they have combos but I don't know what those are, mainly because I respect myself too much to eat here.The menu - tiny print, poorly designed, unclear wording, not enough images - shows 2 or 3 combos, none of which would be practical for a single perso
431;Layover in Toronto and was hungry for Chinese. Was also curious to eat at a Susur Lee restaurant, having known him to be a celebrity chef with a few good restaurants to his name. But oh was I so sadly disappointed. Terrible service- inattentive and unapologetic for dirty chopsticks. Had to chase the staff for water, sharing plates and utensils. Food was extremely overpriced for what you got. $28 "award-winning" chicken curry tasted like a bad food court dish. Udon soup at $22 a bowl was the most overpriced and underwhelming bowl of noodles I've ever had. We weren't sure what to do but after deciding not to tip, the waiter laughed out loud when he took the receipt in his hands. This place should shut down and Susur Lee oughta be ashamed.
432;Avoid this place unless you're out of alternative. Long service. Super overpriced food, tiny portions and service is also very long..You much better off the kiosks in front
433;Thought i was gonna get some sweet dimsum before my flight. Jokes on me, for thinking i could get good food at the airport. I got the dimsum sampler, everything was over steamed and cracked from being over cooked. DONT BOTHER COMING IN just get some food from somewhere else. For $2.50 a piece you're getting ripped off.
434;Waited 5 minutes to be seated, was told to seat ourselves. Waited 5 minutes to be greeted and get a menu. Stood up and got the menu myself. Waited 10 more minutes to have our order taken, nothing. Stood up and left. I'd rather fly on an empty stomach then try this place again.
435;We came here to grab a lunch, ordered noodle soups wand waited 30mins still no food. We have to go because flight is boarding. Just paid $40 for nothing. Do not visit if you don't have 1hr to spent!
436;Bad Pat Thai. Really awful taste. It was too salty and doesn't taste like any Thai I had before. I am not exaggerating. I am not a picky person. I had so much Thai food in my life so I know what is good what is bad. I lived in the US for 8 yrs so I know what Americanized Thai food taste like. I had been to Thailand twice so i know what real Thai food is.This is extremely disappointing.However, manager and waiter have good attitude and cancelled my food order even I wanted to pay. Good service, bad chef?
437;Need a quick bite before your flight? Then AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE. Food is mediocre - standard overpriced airport disappointing stuff. I always eat here because it's dim sum and I'm an idiot. Ask for your bill the moment they seat you and maaaaaaaybe you'll manage to make your flight departing in 3 hours.
438;Terrible service with average food. Staff not doing justice to Susur Lee brand. Will not go back.
439;Horrendous service: slow to take our order, lots of needless and tacky up selling, and incapable of giving us a bill in a timely manner: it's an airport restaurant! Food is OK but nothing like the real downtown restaurants.If I were Susur, I'd be embarrassed. He should be.
440;At 11 am with few customers, service was slow. I had the dim sum sampler, half of which I enjoyed, but the sodium content is sky high. Six hours and several large glasses of water later, my mouth is still dry.  I did not add any condiments either!
441;I'm veggie.    This place sucks.    Really nothing that fits as a vegetarian entree.   Salad or Veggie spring rolls.  Come on.  That's all you can do?   Waiter barks at us.  This is a thrill.   Argh.  (Turned out our waiter was also the barkeeper.).  So I decided to eat dessert.  Allow me to translate chef Susur Lee meant by "banana blueberry cake with vanilla bean ice cream and salted caramel topping".  He meant a very small banana-blueberry bran muffin, with a sprig of peppermint inserted in the peak, straddled by a scoop of melting vanilla ice cream, with 6 blueberries and some quite unsalted caramel sauce on a 12" plate.   $12.   Airport food.   Eat before you come.   Eat on a plane.  This place blows.  How did they get 2.5 stars?
442;Ordered breakfast for takeout before a morning flight. Omelette, Smoked salmon on a bagel and a yogurt parfait (for 3 of us), with 3 bottles of water. Pretty pricey at nearly $70, which was not unexpected given the main restaurant's reputation.My Yogurt parfait was not as described - supposed to be fresh and dried fruit and a honey granola with Greek yogurt. Yogurt did not seem to be greek, and there was no granola. It was just a huge bowl of yogurt with dried fruit and some fresh berries on top. Not a parfait at all (should be layered). Very disappointing for the price.Other food was OK according to my family, but I would expect much more for the money. We enjoy Lee in downtown Toronto, so it is this location that is substandard. I can't see this place lasting long if this is what they serve.
443;Very slow service. waited for 20' for a tiny bow of wonton soup. Still no meal until boarding.
444;Definitely the place to avoid at t1 international gate. Service was really bad. Servers just ignored customer. I was expecting the food could taste better than average Chinese restaurant food because of the name. I was totally wrong. The beef noodle taste much worse than $8 noodle from China town.
445;For being Dim sum place, you would think they would have edible dim sum.   You would be wrong.Microwaved balls of low quality meat.Lesson learned always yelp at airport.
446;I tried to find reasons to like this restaurant but after our brief experience there, it seems impossible. First we needed to ask for a table, once sitting, we were ready to order immediately as we had checked out the menu prior to coming in. They were quick to seat everyone else who came in, and since they were seating so many people, they were mixing up orders and giving other people who arrived after us the food which we ordered. They brought us fried wontons instead of the shiu mai and har gow we had ordered - after some investigation with the server, we were told that it was his first day. All good with us, we're easygoing people. It was only after we realized they served the same dish (which we had touched to inspect what it was) to the couple next to us as if they simply brought it to the wrong table. They brought the food over to them as if it was fresh out of the kitchen - this was EXTREMELY CONCERNING. Our food was not fresh and was clearly left to steam too long. They did not compensate in any way 
447;I can only guess that Mr. Lee has never eaten here and if he has, his standards have fallen through the floor. Food was inedible, dim sum over cooked, fried food left a puddle of grease,  and the service was indifferent. Terrible value. Save your money.
448;As above. Stay away. The servers must be angry or something. The person greeted us grunted and never even look at us (should've been the first hint)Our server seems also only communicate in short, terse, angry words. I ordered 3 kids menu item that actually had 2 further options. Waiter didn't even blink. When i find out 5 minute later. He just told me he picked for me. It's like he couldn't even bother grunting me a heads up.  These guys seems to really hate working here.  It's pretty disappointing. The concept is good. Implementation.... I prob should've stuck with a burger. At least they wouldn't make me feel like Obama at Putin's house party.
449;As an asian and a fan of Susur's ( I watch a lot of food network television) I was hoping for much more flavourful fare from a restaurant bearing Susur's name. I understand that airport food is not amazing but the food I had at Rick Bayless' reataurant in Chicago O'hare was great. The wonton noodle soup that I had was very bland although the shrimp wontons were tasty. I've made much better soup bases at home. The crispy spring rolls were mostly dough but the dipping mayo was spicy and good. My husband had the beef tacos and they were good but for a $20 plate the portion was tiny. He was still hungry. This was a disappointment especially since the Toronto Pearson international section had few proper restaurants.
450;Stay away. From the food to the service, it was a thoroughly disappointing experience to put it mildly. Service: I counted maybe 10 patrons at the restaurant and with two servers we waited over ten minutes for a menu and to order. This was just the start of the horrible service. When asking another server while ours was busy we received a rude, condescending response, bashing the other server in the process. When the food arrived our order was wrong and we ordered just two items. Lastly half the tables were still dirty and had half eaten meals still sitting around for the duration of our meal.Food: Terribly average food. Yes if you're looking for dim sum at the airport it's a nice novelty but it's average dim sum at best and for something to have Susur Lee's name on it I expected much more. The grapes were unwashed and the potatoes underseasoned. I won't say it was overpriced because let's be honest what isn't at an airport, but for $7-9 a plate of dim sum a lot was left to be desired.Overall, there a
451;I was excited to see the Lee brand in the airport as I was traveling via terminal one at YYZ.  I've had great food at their main location and most of all I had incredible service.   I was hoping for something along the line and curbed my expectations given its airport fare.   But wtf batman, I wait at the front for a table the waiters don't say nothing and I ask if I can seat myself he points at a chair.  I sit. And I am sitting here.  And it's been over 7 minutes I have not been given a menu.  Waitress and waiter have gone passed me 3 times. Probably they could see the one star at the top of this review.  Even if I had the food now it would be tarnished by this experience.  Ugh.
452;1.5 stars: This place really capitalizes on sleepless travellers on layovers and the lack of other food options at the international terminal in Pearson airport.My very low expectations were "met" and I unfortunately wasn't able to come away pleasantly surprised. I ordered the General Tao chicken which tasted on par with Chinese food court chicken except double the price ($19) and half the size. It was "tasty" in a food court way which I regretted once I boarded my flight.Would only come back because it is here or the soggy panini place across from here.
453;If you walk by this place and happen to see that there's no one inside on a Friday night then you probably know why I rated 1 star. No need to explain further because it absolutely sucks.
454;DON'T TRY THIS PLACE! It's the first time I've ever tried such a complete shitty restaurant. It sucks in every way. The rice noodle texture is wrong, the soup is not hot and taste plain, the server seems know nothing she should know, and the speed is slow. Moreover, it is very over priced as a tiny and far below average rice noodle restaurant. I had the professional on bridge rice noodle. the portion is very small and it is $13 before tax and tips. If i could i wanna give negative star.......... so definitely not gonna go back nor recommend it to anyone.
455;This used to be my ALL TIME FAVOURITE place to have noodlesHowever, my recent two visits have changed my opinion of this place completely.1. On my second last visit, the meat tastes really weird. It is not rotten, but it tastes like meat that has been in the freezer for two weeks.2. On my last visit, the vegetable (Shanghai Bak Choi or 油菜) is rotten and COMPLETELY UNEDIBLE, I had to spit it out (my friend couldn't swallow it either)In my opinion, the flavour of the soup is really nice, but the quality needs huge huge improvement. It is truly disappointing to see a place I've loved so much became so awful. Not to mention that the portions have been small since day 1.This is the longest review I have ever written in my life. Owners, please take my suggestions into consideration.
456;We went to this place and ordered, ate, and then read the review. Now i would say i regret that, we should've read the reviews first, because they are spot on, about how this place is not good at all. There are so many problems its hard to just go with one. The food was the main problem of course which is the core of every restaurant, the food was not good at this restaurant, it is not going to wow anyone, its taste was plain wrong, just overly salty, and it seems not many people enjoyed it either, cause reading the other reviews has solidified that not a lot of people have found redeeming features in the restaurant. it is sad, considering that Yunnan noodles are something that could be good, but it seems to be really hard to find a decent one in Toronto. The service is also not good at this place as the servers are confused in 3 languages, Mandarin, Cantonese, and English. which makes you clear that they are just confused, they get the orders wrong, multiple times, and are slow to react to people even when
457;Extremely disappointing experience. Toppings here are worse than the toppings packets in cup noodles (very little variety and small portions). Also, the soup is not even hot, making it very difficult to cook the raw frozen toppings. TLDR this place sucks!
458;Decided to give this place a try since I've never been and I'm a huge fan of noodles. When we walked in during dinner time, the place was empty which sort of raises a red flag for me but we decided to try the place anyways. After we sat down, I looked on Yelp for recommendations of what to order, and I noticed this place only has 2 stars. I regret not looking on Yelp before entering this restaurant but since we were already there, I felt bad to leave. I realized that the place doesn't have a lot of reviews to begin with so it may not be a great representation of what the place is really like until I try it for myself. But because the reviews were so bad, my friend and I decided to order one bowl of noodles and just share it because we didn't want to spend our money here. When the waitress realized that we were only getting one bowl of noodles between the two of us, she gave us a dirty stare. I got a little annoyed when she did that but I guess I can't blame her since we were being cheap with our orders. W
459;Wow.. this place is not good. Extremely overpriced and the portions are really small .. my fiancé and I had to eat elsewhere afterwards.  Noodles are definitely store-bought. It's just a bunch of hotpot stuff dumped in a little pot... Tables and chairs are uncomfortable and wobbly.... just wish they can do better...You know, why bother to open a space if you can't offer anything special on your menu? FAIL.... -___-
460;Even I can cook better.  This place is more about food presentation. They put the ingredients on a plate nicely. Anyways it tastes bad.
461;I have to 100% agree with Brenda A.  I really enjoy Subway subs but this particular location has to be the worse one I've ever visited - head office should be notified and I swear they should shut them down and they can reopen under a new name, "Shitway".  I should have just walked out when I noticed no other customers were in there and this was during lunch.  They were so stringy with the tuna and toppings and when I asked for more onions, they pretended to put them on - like it's onions not caviar!  AND, the bread was so nasty and stale - it was definitely way over two days' old because it was making a mess everywhere and the ends were like Melba Toast.  Here's the kicker: while I was waiting for the piece of crap to be prepared, this miserable looking weirdo chick behind the counter kept starring me down - like WTF!  AND the guy behind the cash was so rude took my money, no thank you, nothing - just put the receipt on top of the piece of crap so-called sub and walked off.  Just avoid all together.
462;I agree with other two reviews. Worst subway ive ever been to.  I asked for tomatoes and the indian lady put on 3 freken tomatoes. I literally had to ask for more topping on each item 2 or 3 times before it had a regular amount.  They wont give more than 1 napkin and literally cut the subway wrapper in half for 6 inch sub . Cheap filthy indian service and cleanliness.  If I could give 1 star its too much.
463;First I want to say I love Subway subs, I just dislike this particular store. The people who work there are very cheap and do not put enough toppings on the subs, even when you ask for more they take two or three pieces of the topping to add but pretend they are adding more by moving their hand quickly around the sub. Forget about polite service as well, they don't look at you when they speak to you and you won't get a "thank you" when the transaction is complete. Avoid this location all together
464;This place is horrible. I recommend to never buy anything from here. I went to there store on Wilson and Bathurst and wanted to purchase there Filipino dessert called yema. I bought 3 boxes and when I went home to try it, it was rock hard. Then I checked the expiry date and it was expired in Jan of 2017. How could any food shop sell an expired item especially when it's been 2 months!
465;Incredibly slow service, and even though the girl serving me was in training, her manager was too busy giving her dirty looks and making her feel stupid rather than helping her out.  Prices are great, but the toppings in my noodles (palabok) were almost non-existent.  The cashier rolled her eyes at me, no thank you or the warm greeting or farewell that Filipinos are supposedly known for.  It's an embarassment and a poor reflection on the Filipino community.  If you're in the industry of serving customers, you have a long way to go guys.If you want decently priced average food and don't care to be treated like crap, go here.
466;I tried there halo halo is okay but the customer service here sucks. If you dont speak tagalog, dont expect your order to come till 10 mins later
467;Sunday..excited to eat BBQ in this branch but was dismayed when the BBQ is cold and hard, as if it was like a yesterday once more thing. Are you making customers like idiots? Same thing in Lawernce branch, the dinakdakan I bought was cold and amoy panis. Please watch out what you are preparing before someone gets sick and you get into trouble. Food in Sampaguita of Jollytops is far more better.  In Sampaguita it will be served freshly cooked.I am craving for Pinoy foods...FV wake up, tend to the complaints of your patrons or else no ones gonna eat there. Just a frank and friendly reminder. Walang personalan.
468;Absolutely rubbish experience. I stopped by for a falafel sandwich once which was priced at $4.50 pretty cheap considering the location.The server asked me what I wanted on my sandwich and when i asked him for cucumbers (of which there was a stockpile sitting freshly cut IN THE TOPPING sections) he remarked that its not allowed? That the cucumbers are only reserved for salads.I offered to pay more for cucumbers seeing as I was hungry and didnt really care about price at that point. He refused and made a fuss about it and gave me my money back. So this dude would rather give you your money back than make a sale. What an idiot. This is how YOU DONT RUN a business folks!Ill take my money to the subway restaurant right next to you.
469;We went there to eat with the kids. We asked for hamburger and we were told that they just sold the last one. But 10 minutes later I was picking up the food and there was a hamburger on the grill but I did not want to argue. The staff is rude slow hard to understand. The food is less than average tried the Shawerma and Falafel I am not impressed at all overpriced for the quality. Never go there again.
470;Nice guy at the counter but literally the worst falafel I've ever had. I couldn't even stab it with a fork it was so stale. And very overpriced. Over $10 for a falafel meal with drink.
471;Worst souvlaki dinner ever..!!!I had order for a platter  to go. To start with, the salad was worst. Half of the lettuce was pink and tasted bad. The rice had no flavour and the garlic potatoes were missing. But the souvlaki chicken was good though.
472;I am sorry I didn't review this place before visiting. What a terrible chicken swarma. Salad selection poor, sauce tasteless, meet dry and strange tasting. Falafel very oily. Disgusting overall. Would never return
473;Worst $8 lamb shawarma I have ever had, tough and no flavour, tap water was a large extra charge I forget how much, I refused to pay for that.  What a disappointment and this is no way to do business.  Ugh.
474;My experience today was the worst ever!!!!This restaurant's owner is responsible for taking customers orders, and unfortunately she doesn't know how to treat her customers in a proper way. With her arrogant attitude, she conveyed me a message of not returning back to her restaurant.   From my point of view,  restaurant owners should highly care for their customers' satisfaction. An unhappy customer
475;Terrible customer service. The lady who takes your order seems genuinely annoyed by your mere presence. I'll never set foot in here again and suggest people avoid this place like the plague (Which I'm sure their rancid, over cooked, tasteless meat will soon spread)
476;1st 1 star review in a while... Friend picked this place... I didn't check the reviews before coming otherwise I would've vetoed. Ordered the lamb shawarma. It was terrible. One of the worst I've had.The "lamb" was the biggest letdown. It tasted nothing like lamb, or beef, or pork, or chicken, or any other meat that I've had. I'm not sure what it was. Also it was extremely dry and overcooked. No seasoning at all. They add a few veggies to the wrap but they are all mediocre and do not look fresh. Avoid!
477;Have to agree with the other's on this ...Came here once ...haven't gone back .Too much badder on the fish , which might be a goodThing on this occasion ...why ? You ask ! Well the Oil looked super Dirty ...so all that badder protected my poor Fish from sucking in all that nasty flavor which it still did regardless...anyways ....if your in this plaza for any reason other than using the TD bank or food basics or the Bakery and you get hungry ......then eat at the bakery but read my review on the bakery first lol.... anyway .....To end this it's simpleIt be nice to have a great fish and chips place in the plaza / Area ..All they need to do is freshen up the fish Clean the place and fryers and take some pride .
478;I have tried this take out on different occasion under new ownership and still does not come up to my standard of fish and chips , the main problem with to me as well is the cleanliness , of the place I know its been there for à long time but still nothing to do with keeping the place clean ,has for the food i find there is too much batter not enough fish , and there chips too soggy
479;Very dirty place, oil was black,Takeout lady is the cook, hostess and probably night cleaner as well
480;How is Dairy Queen even serving food? I came here for lunch on my break and I regretted it instantly. I ordered a chicken marinara sandwich and it was gross. Not only did it take forever to make but I literally took three bites and threw it away. It was that bad! Not only is the food bad, the service was atrocious and food was way over priced for what you get. Dairy Queen needs to stick to ice cream. Sadly, even that was awful for me. I ordered a cookie dough blizzard, it was so melted and milky, it was nothing like a blizzard and more like a cookie dough juice. Never ever again! You can catch me somewhere else, even for dessert
481;If you care about customer service, don't even look at this place. I'd like to actually say whomever is managing this place needs to be schooled!Also, the people that work here have no personality. Hellen Keller has more of a personality than the employees at this place!
482;I do not even want to give one star to the place as it is serving burnt out food to customers and on complaint their response is the other one will be the same. This they told me after calling me back from home. The staff was super rude, impolite and actually insulted me in front of all customers. Shame on you guys. No wonder we don't see customers visiting DQ. It was my 2nd unfortunate visit and will never visit the place again.
483;Slowest drive thru ever.  I went thru about a month ago. Ordered a combo and two burgers during my half hour lunch break. After over a 10 minute wait and waving my arms around trying to get they're attention (I'm sure they saw me) a girl finally popped open the window, blurted 'they're being made' and closed the window without giving me a chance to respond. One of the reasons I was trying to get they're attention was to let them know I didn't want pickles. Another girl cones back and hands me the bag...I told her I was unhappy about the very long wait and would she compensate for it...? She rudely responds with a "WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT?" As I turn to my daughter to ask what she'd like...she interrupts and says "I can't give you anything anyway sorry" without even going to speak to a manager. Arrived back at work and opened the bag and one of the burgers was missing. Lots of back and forth between DQ  head office and the location. George the manager finally leaves a message a few days later. I call him back an
484;Was by far the worst pizza I have ever eaten in my life, no wonder there is a promo for $10 pizza each day of the week going on currently! I honestly should have stuck with dominos and pizza nova, thanks for reminding me to avoid pizza hut like the plague that it is. Lack of cheese, undercooked and lack of any toppings, this erin mills location of pizza hut is terrible.Pizza Hut has gone way down in quality since Yum Brands took over. How about you guys enforce your franchisees to use fresh ingredients and not skimp on toppings/cheese. I will never return to pizza hut and this reminded me why I have not gone there in 2 years. I hope the CEO: Greg Creed, Executive Chair: David C. Novak, AND CFO Patrick J. Grismer of Yum Brands, choke on a piece of stale crusty ass pizza from the erin mills location, there is a special place in Hell where they serve pizza from store# R32816 erin mills.
485;Only the top of my pizza and cinnamon rolls were cooked. ordered a small pizza but brought it back to the hotel and couldn't lift it from the pan..? Why was there a pan? Anyways, finally got a piece ripped off and it was completely undercooked. my cinnamon rolls were pretty decent until I bit into a chunk that was also completely uncooked and cold and that completed my meal. No thanks :)
486;I am no skinny guy and eat a lot of take out. Not proud of that, but I do want any reader of this to understand and trust a person that eats at or from locations more than once. I ordered a pizza via the dominoes smart phone App, which is fantastic and I have done it a few times before. The last time, the delivery took 1 hour and that is not the issue. The issue is that the pizza was horrible. Cold and just bad. It was barely eatable. Shamefully. I did eat it, because I was hungry and I didn't want to leave the delivery person hanging, because I know he was just doing his best.I am a working person like all and he was not to blame for the way this specific franchise has been run since it opened at this specific location. So I still paid and tipped that driver 20 percent and took the cold pizza and again sadly admit I heated it up and ate it. Not dominoes fault I chose to still eat it, but I was being too nice. I figure life is too short to sweat a couple of pizza. I am busy working from home and t
487;Stay away from this location!!Ordered a large pizza and breadsticks for delivery. After waiting 45mins I noticed that the pizza was COLD. Called up the store and they informed me that it takes on average 40-50 mins for delivery even though I live down the street from the store. This is the second time I received a cold pizza from this location, and the last time I order dominos again.
488;don't waste your time like I did, worst pizza experience. yesterday I ordered a medium pizza with two dipping sauce, they had a %50 percent deal going on so the total came up to $13. the pizza came OVER 2 HOURS later!! also the pizza was cold, it wasn't even cut and they forgot my dipping sauce. the worst part was I called the store several times and every time it went to voicemail. the driver said he would pay for my next pizza if I call the next day and just explain what happened. when I called today the lady on the phone said the best she can do is give me %75 off my price that I paid yesterday so I would pay around $3. when the pizza came this time the driver had a different price then what was told to me. I called the store before paying for this new pizza and someone new picked up and no one could find the price that was told to me earlier. now I'm pissed because I wasted my money twice on this pizza and I always order from this place. any new pizza place ideas?
489;I ordered from this resturant on uber eats. I order 2 chicken Sharwama 2 beef sharwama 2 fries 2 gingerales. I received my order and it was completely wrong. I got 2 chicken and beef mixed sharwamas and the following orders. Also uber eats said a female would be delivering my item and it was a male. I was super upset and by the resturant was closed. I called uber eats and when they called the store, the store reported that they gave the correct order and even the FEMALE driver confirmed she gave me the right order. ( it was a male driver that delivered ) I couldn't believe the lies I felt as if I was being scammed out of 41 dollars. The uber representative said she'd refund my money and credit me 20 dollars. I received the 20 dollar credit still waiting on my full refund. Just don't order from these guys.
490;Dry as dust.Falafel was flavourless.I suffer when I don't bring my own lunch to work.
491;The absolute worst piece of pizza I have ever had. One bite and it went in the garbage! It was way undercooked. I would not recommend at all.
492;Oh boy, what can I say about this place. This 241 location is just...Gross. That pretty much sums up the experience here. The food itself is what it is...decent take out pizza and panzerotti - which is what I regretfully ordered after having to eat the whole thing with my bare hands, due to not wishing to use the dirty cutlery given to me. My hands covered in grease is one thing, but watching the lady behind the counter pull out the plastic knife/fork from a dirty bin on the bottom shelf, casually wiping them off with a towel (though still leaving dirt stains on it) did not help with the appetite. Also quite unappetizing, seeing the lady behind the counter place pizza toppings into the dough with her bare hands, meanwhile taking a moment here and there to wipe her runny nose! This entire location is just dirty. As soon as you walk in, you will see the stained and damaged floors, the uncleaned counter, the unhygienic area behind the counter, and the unkept display shelf where the pizza lay. I didn't look
493;Never again. Pizza is very plain and odd. Rather pay the extra for pizza pizza then this. We had a panzo the other night and it had no sauce what so ever (inside) and that for us is a big no noAnyways don't order 2 4 1 it's worth it.
494;Went for a quick ice cream as needed that pick me up. Ordered a chocolate dip cone and a large vanilla cone. Their large looked like a medium as other dairy queens make it better and the ice cream had frozen bits inside.  Will not visit the Dufferin location again. Usually we go to Newmarket or Markham location which is great but we were in Downsview so that's why we visited the Dufferin location. Bad location.
495;Ordered the "artichoke" pizza with chicken on June 21 2011 at 1600hrs.  Spoke to the delivery guy who called me "sir" when I'm a "ma'am", and basically didn't listen to the order.  Spoke to the pizza maker as well, about putting the artichokes on the pizza in good sized chunks.   I've ordered from the Yonge street locations many times and never had a problem, because they ask questions about the order.  What arrived at my door the first time was a artichoke pizza in red sauce with chicken.  I immediately called and spoke to the the person answering.  He proceeded to argue with me about the order, saying  all kinds of things.  In the end, he delivered the correct pizza - Bianca with chicken.  The guy on the phone happened to be the delivery guy as well.  Again another argument, saying that I didn't order chicken on the pizza, I didn't say Bianca...whatever.  I said I wanted an artichoke pizza on thin crust with chicken.  It was up to him to work out the details, not show up at my house and bring the second piz
496;I will NEVER order from Pizzaiolo again!I ordered a Party pizza and a gluten free pizza online. The order arrived and I had a medium pizza and the "gluten free" pizza was not in its usual gluten free box. I immediately called and left the guy know the mix up. I asked about the GF pizza and he told me that they never put them in GF boxes, despite my friend who has Celiac being very clear that every other Pizzaiolo location she has been to has special boxes for their GF pizzas. After another couple minutes of the back and fourth while I tried to ask if the pizza was actually GF or if it would make her sick, he admitted that they had run out of boxes. He then goes on to tell me that the Medium pizza came to him through the online system as a Medium and not a party, so basically too bad. I asked if the online ordering system could have messed it up. He admits that it could have and asks if I would like a new one made. I tell that I would, but that I have already waited an hour for this pizza and we had to leav
497;I ordered for delivery online. An hour later it still hadn't arrived so I called to check on it. Without even asking what order it was the guy immediately told me that it was out for delivery. When I asked him how he could tell given I hadn't even given him the order number or address he put me on hold. He then came back on the phone, asked me what I wanted again and then told me the same thing as if we hadn't just spoken. Needless to say it's the last time I am ordering from this location.
498;Terrible, we used to have good service ad delicious pizza from them but the last few times we have ordered it has taken TWO hours for our pizza to arrive and we live just 2 blocks away!! This resulted in the pizza being cold and tasting terrible. Go to the yonge street location instead (too bad yonge street doesn't deliver).
499;I  so mad right now. I ordered pizza 1.5 hours ago and called to find out where it was. They told me they did not make it! They said the could not find my phone number and that is why they did not call to say they were not going to make it, apparently we were too far, but we are only a few blocks away. I have no idea how a business can run like this. Unacceptable! All pizzaiolo restaurants seem to be poorly run and this was the last straw. Do not call here for delivery, you may not get a pizza.
500;Their specialty does not come in snack size. WHY. I can't finish a regular. I never really liked their poutine, their fries are really really soggy and I'm not even talking about when I get to the end (which has never been done by myself) but right when they serve it, my fries aren't crispy. I also paid $10.15 for a regular size poutine... that tasted like cardboard. Soggy cardboard.Will not be returning.
501;Without question the worst poutine I've ever had. I tried the "montreal" which was poutine with smoked meat, mustard and a pickle. My poutine was smothered in at least a half cup of mustard. It was so overpowering that I couldn't even taste what little gravy they gave me. The portion of smoked meat was also disappointing. No more than the shavings from a couple small thin pieces of flavorless smoked meat - like the scraps left on your plate after eating a smoked meat sandwich from Caplansky's. The fries were overcooked and very dry too. The entire dish was so off putting that I actually tossed it in the trash after only a few bites. All this magic in one box for a ridiculous $12 including a can of soda. 1 star for the quick service and the pickle which was pretty good once I stripped it of its mustard coating. the interior was clean and spacious too (and not surprisingly....empty).  Someone please, please tell me how this franchise keeps expanding let alone stay in business? Especially this location
502;by far the worst smokes location ive been to, this place doubles as a smokes poutinerie and the weinerie in one grouping. i had to clean the table today, so me and my friends could sit at a clean setting. my s.o.'s steamies were lackluster, with one being falsely advertised, and the other being under-cooked. when we went back for a refund, we were met with an agressive attitude, to the point where the cashier slammed BOTH fists down on the counter, did a major sigh and requested her co-worker to come give the refund.to further the point, i emailed the franchise to let them know about this, and the manager called me a "ms" unlike other smokes poutinerie, this location doesn't have a blackboard...which is a staple with other franchised outletsI WILL NEVER STEP FOOT AT THIS LOCATION AGAIN.if i could put negative stars, i would.
503;Was studying downtown at U of T when we were pleasantly surprised to see that they had a Smoke's close by. We frequent the Oshawa location and have always had great service and food.We decided to get a poutine hot dog and snack size traditional poutine. While the staff were friendly and the poutine was ok, the hot dog was horrible. The hot dog tasted stale and there was barely any cheese on the hot dog. Not sure if it was an off order or not, but our experience with the food was poor. Hopefully they fix the problem soon.
504;The food is great like any smoke's poutinerie! However, if you don't like your order being messed up, id suggest you take your business else where. I ordered the veggie nacho poutine under the vegetarian menu for my vegetarian girlfriend and I. To our surprise there was MEAT chilli on it, what a weird vegetarian topping!
505;After a horrible initial experience during their first week of operation, I finally decided to give them another chance 6 or so months later, but unfortunately, nothing much has changed. The food was edible enough (it's kinda hard to screw up steamed hot dogs), but the blatantly ridiculous part of the operation is a complete lack of employee training. During both visits, it seemed like the guys behind the counter were ripped directly from the customer line-up, with zero knowledge of the menu, or how to serve and prepare the steamies being offered. They seem to have greatly reduced the steamed hotdog options since opening, which is not surprising, since the guys dolling out the tube meat on my first visit had no clue what I ordered was even on their menu, leading to confused faces between the two gents before they checked every nook and cranny of their stations before finally putting two and two together. My second order was also a bit weird, with the guy at the cash being perplexed that I'd pay for a $3.75 or
506;This store lacks in customer service. No smiles, no friendly welcome just bland customer service.  Four words are spoken by the girl at the counter. "Can I help you". Placed an order for a sundae.  I did get my order very quickly, so speed is not an issue.  Sat down on the bench took two spoon bites noticed a very long hair embedded in the ice cream.  Noted that the girls at the counter tie up their hair very loosely.  I think hair nets would be very appropriate.  Took the ice cream back.  I could understand if I ate half of the ice cream and took it back with a "hair in it" and demanded another one.  However, after only two spoons I could honestly say that there was a hair in it.  When I showed it to the girl who made my sundae she looked at me and said "yeah but" and looked at my long hair.  I noted that it was embedded in my sundae and that there is no way I could have put it in the ice cream.  Noting no finger or spoon marks.  Geez I had to prove that it wasn't me.  Seriously after two spoons! She replace
507;Bad service. People behind the counter behave like robots. Frowns everywhere. It's almost they hate being there.
508;Meal I had wasn't that good and food wasn't hot.  I would rather spend my money elsewhere and have a more enjoyable meal.
509;I really like the burgers at A & W but there is an incompetent cashier there who constantly gets my burger order done wrong and argues with me about it. She is an older Asian lady whose English is almost non existent. First of all she kept referring to ketchup and mayonnaise as "sauce" when that should correctly refer to special sauce. She complained I was unclear. This has happened 4 times already at this A & W location!She also doesn't understand to omit the other toppings when I ask for heavy pickle heavy onion and God help me, after my order got messed up again today and I had to take it back, she complained again that I was unclear and shouted, "What means heavy pickle heavy onion?" Lady, it means NO KETCHUP NO MAYONNAISE NO LETTUCE NO TOMATOES, AND *EXTRA* PICKLES AND *EXTRA* ONIONS!! Stop giving me a regular burger with all the toppings, a disgusting glob of ketchup and mayo and just a few pickle slices and onions, nothing extra. *FACEPALMS*I've already sent emails complaining about this cashier 
510;had a chicken souvlaki plate (which was the 'kitchen special') because all the other options looked so underwhelming. the pita literally made me spit it out because it had a chemical taste to it. no idea what it actually was. beyond that the chicken was microwaved, and i'm not sure where or when it was cooked either. the rest of the plate was fine, but bland. despite the convenient location, i doubt i'll ever try it again.
511;We went here for a lunch meeting last Monday, and ended up having to settle for breakfast food because they were out of several basic ingredients. When we expressed surprise, we were told, "Welcome to Mondays!" [Note to self: do not eat here on Mondays.]
512;Worst Tim Hortons ever. We only come here for a pit stop before we go to work. Horrible service, they never get the orders right even if you slow down your speech to tell them.
513;The staff is so rude, I never go to this tim hortons just because of the it.
514;Everyone is right.  Service is terrible.  Might as well shut this place down.  Worst neighborhood pub anywhere.
515;I had been to this place around 3 times and was never really impressed with the service. I do however really enjoy the jerk wings with Caesar dressing. I convinced one of my best friends to join me one night for the wings. We were greeted promptly at the door, seated, and our drink order taken. It was not very busy that night. Our drinks came right away and menus were presented to us. We knew what we wanted so it didn't take us very long to decide. We placed the menus on the other side of the table hoping that the server would realize we were ready to order. We had to ask someone to send our server over. This took a while. My buddy ordered first, his order was the jerk wings with Caesar dressing, an order of fries with gravy. When the sever turned to me, I said "I will have exactly the same".We enjoyed our drinks and awaited our food. My friend's order arrived soon but mine did not, I figured my food was on its way shortly. I waited and finished my beer. I had to flag the waitress down to ask about my food.
516;Yikes!!!!  I don't take one star reviews lightly, but I can honesty say this place was the worst.  We left in a huff which was not even noticed by the staff as they were too busy with their own personal issues it seems.  My hubby was mad a me for dragging him to this place!!  Would not go again.
517;I went to stone corner for the second time in my life. First time was for my best friends 26th birthday, a month ago (terrible service a.k.a none). That time, we had to ask other people we knew to buy us drinks because the bartenders only served people they knew.   This time we attended after the jays game ( myself and my best friend who celebrated her birthday last month). We had ONE drink, sang two karaoke songs when the security guard approached myself (27) and my best friend (26, that celebrated her birthday the month before). He asked for IDs after we had already been there for half an hour and had already provided them upon entrance to the bar. We provided him with our driver licenses. He disappeared and we found him back at the front. I asked him for my ID back when he decided to ask me for my zodiac sign name street name age etc. Then he proceeds to ask for a second piece of ID. I provided him with my health card and he said ok. He did the same with my friend and she didn't bring a second piece as
518;New pub night. more like new pub not!  My husband and I wanted to mix things up and try a new pub, I wish we used Yelp instead of google maps to choose the location. The Stone Corner Pub, from the website and menu (they advertise gluten free and veg friendly items) appeared to be a great choice. Situated in the corner of a strip mall the exterior was nothing to write home about, but the interior was comfortable enough.  Save the extra low booth seats/high tables (you might want to request a phone book to sit on) and the oddly positioned televisions (they all face the door). The food, however was something to write about. It was Tapas night at the pub, so you can try a variety of app items for only 5.99.  Mistakenly, we ordered the mussels in a coconut curry sauce. If you like extremely fishy and off tasting seafood, this ones for you.  Dinner was not much better.  My husband ordered the Jerk Chicken Sandwich which was supposed to include chicken, but was just a sloppy pile of extra creamy coleslaw and a
519;This place can't be worse. It's not clean. Service is bad. I have witnessed( twice) how the sandwich maker touched money with her gloves for the previous customer and then made a sandwich with the same gloves. This is disgusting and I hope they close down soon.
520;I walked into this Subway Sandwich restaurant at 9:30 pm. The employee (Bangladeshi Gentleman) looked very annoyed.He said he is closing in a few minutes and I should return another day...lol...this never happened to me in my life before.
521;If you are college student trying to use the discount coupons, don't go here they don't accept coupons. Just walk across to Yonge street. Thank me for saving your time. :)
522;I'm guessing this place is busy at lunch time, because it was completely dead at 7:30 on a weeknight but the trash cans were full. Secondly, the ONLY thing from the menu was dry, overcooked chicken and the only other thing they had were 4 falafel that I'm really not sure how long had been sitting there.Other items they SHOULD have had were beef, kabobs, etc. - none. Won't be back and won't be recommending to nearby businesses.
523;- eat somewhere else. anywhere else.- shawarma shouldn't taste that bad. notice how you dont see ethnic ppl eat here.... very telling sign.....
524;They have the best weekend deals. The worst customer service with stinky food. Never ever will waste my money their.
525;My husband and I love Subway and would eat here 2x a day if I wasn't so frugal or the sandwiches weren't so full of sodium but this location is HORRIBLE! Not only are all the employees including the owner miserable but it has to be the thinnest weakest subs we've ever had. He gets veggie so w/o any meat you'd think they'd give him an appropriate amount of vegetables but they are so stingy you are lucky to get 3 tomato slices on a foot long.For now on we only buy from Yonge/Eglinton when at work, they are great people lots of veggies or in Unionville at Hwy 7 where we've gone for years they have his sub memorized and are always generous with the toppings.
526;One star is being generous.... people there are rude (especially the owner) and the main reason for the 1 star is for the fact that they do not make your Sub the way you like it. They get upset for asking for extra toppings and really try to rush you out..... also got I'll, May not have been from there but I'm not going back. Go to another location..... this one wasn't worth it
527;You are going to Love this review. There is a ton to write about this crappy place.Story goes: i went to have lunch with a close friend. While there i ordered my typical meatball sub with extra mayo and lettuce --- Please note that i said EXTRA. When i saw him make the sub, there was 1 line of mayo and 1 handfull of lettuce. Since i ordered a combo, i decided i was gonna get a drink to go with the sub. I poured myself a coke. MY friend had a steak and something sub with very little ingredients and sauce. What happens next threw me and my friend off. My friend poured himself a coke but he wanted a root beer and since the dispenser said "1 refill per customer" he took advantage of this and poured out the coke and started to dispense some root beer. The guy working there at the time YELLED at my friend and kicked us out. ----Shitty service and shitty food. they are lucky to have a high school near this location. That is probably the only thing that is making them making money
528;Don't eat here they serve moldy bread for their sandwiches I hope they call the health and safety board as the guy told my friend the bun was fine! Meanwell there is mould all over the bread!
529;The employee women with the green shirt and lighten ends has a horrible attitude. She yells at customers and gets upset if you don't hurry up with ordering. She gives dirty looks and looks you up and down. She got my order wrong, I order with no tomatoes but I got tomatoes.
530;Take the lowest cost frozen food from a discount store, add a deep frier, and you've duplicated this place. I would choose any other option. They do have a delivery car though if you literally have no other options and are opposed to just eating ice cubes from your freezer (Seriously, that's a better choice - these folks can't fry fries).
531;Worst food ever a garden salad is iceberg lettuce with pickles and tomato gross! Waited an hour and a half for food club sub with ham not turkey never ever again subs are dry
532;One and DONE!One star, one visit.........never EVER would I go again.I enjoy a big, gluttonous burrito like everyone.It is what I've come to expect, big, heavy, filling, yummy in my tummy.Not the case when it comes to this place.Popped in Friday night since it was close to home. Was really looking forward to a great burrito place that was in my area. I was VERY disappointed. My LARGE burrito was not LARGE in my opinion. Steak strips were steak cubes!I must say, I laugh when places market themselves as cheaper than the competition, yet everything is "extra." My steak burrito came to $10, more than I would have spent at Big Bite Burritos ($8.99 LRG) and Fat Bastard Burritos ($9.39 LRG). So not only did it cost more, the portion was far less than the competition.This place is SOOOOOOO  cheap on toppings. The amount of cheese they put on my burrito was laughable. I honestly wish I walked out. And after trying the burrito I can tell you my wife wishes I did indeed walk out. What also kills me is for 
533;I gave this place a shot, seeing that they seemed to have a good crowd coming in, food looked good, etc.. so i figured what the heck.Very disappointing. Ordered takeout. Small chicken souvlaki plate - meat was dry, overcooked and basically tasted like burnt charcoal. Also ordered a chicken gyro plate - meat was slimy and flavourless, looked like a shredded rotisserie chicken. Gross. How is this a gyro?!?!Greek salad tasted like nothing, just bland with some oil and chunks of flavourless feta.And the kicker...THEY FORGOT TO PUT TZATZIKI IN MY TAKEOUT BAG!! Despite the overall horrible experience, I couldn't help but laugh at the irony in this. Forgetting tzatziki is kind of an important detail, given the name of your establishment.Sorry, will be crossing this one off my list.
534;Dropped by Tzatziki last week to have lunch with my collogue, a friendly lady was working in the kitchen. She seemed out of order she dropped what seem to be the cutting knife for the  gyro on the ground and picked up and continued as if nothing happen.  I was with my collogue I didn't want to make a deal about it since I recommended the place to him, but it was very unprofessional and unsanitary thing to do. So again I went there tonight alone this time to get take out. I ordered two pork gyros on a pita no onion extra Tzatziki, with much excitement I got to see the cook picking his nose as I came out of the bathroom this was after I paid for my gyros. I asked the man for his name and his respond was (KIMON sir how are you) I tolled him great thanks. I did pick up a menu and I will be contacting the owners of this restaurant as well as the health department. I absolutely was appalled. Richard G.
535;This review is based on multiple visits over the span of 6 months.My first visit was in November 2014. Great service, delicious food & at a price point that was reasonable.My second visit was for take out, similar to the first.. Fast service, delicious food. Definitely no complaints.Our third visit should have been a clear indication of how this place was losing its momentum. The service was slow, the food was lukewarm when we finally got it & then it took another 30 minutes just to get the bill.Our last visit was the final straw. We decided to order online through their website. Got to the restaurant about 45 minutes after placing the order & the girl at the cash couldn't find our order. She then called someone else over, who pointed at a printer with our order receipt clearly just sitting there with no intention on being processed.They apologized & said it would be ready in 5 minutes.20 minutes later, we notice the our take out order sitting on plates waiting to be served. It sat on the counter 
536;I wanted so badly to give Tzatziki a good review, as the first time we ordered take out during their Grand Opening, the food was amazing (huge portions, LOTS of extra tzatziki, great flavours). However, a week ago, we decided to order take out again and unfortunately, our experience wasn't even close to what it was the first time. Once we got home with our food, we realized that they had forgotten to give us our Greek Fries. I called them and spoke with a girl who asked me in an accusatory tone, "Did you pay for them?" - I found this ridiculous, as why would I call about my missing fries if I didn't pay for them? (This was after I spent $40 dollars on dinner.. .not likely I would lie about having paid for a $4 order of fries.) After pressing the issue some more, she agreed to have the missing fries delivered. We live a 5 minute drive away, and it took them almost an hour to get the fries to us. The lady I spoke to on the phone was rude and condescending when I called back to ask them where they were. She blam
537;This was my absolute favorite place to get Greek food. The gyros actually tasted like they were from the islands. Unfortunately the food quality went to hell. The pita tastes days old, they only put half the amount of meat they used to put, and their tzatziki is watery. I used to travel all the way from Richmond hill just to have a gyro. Now I guess it's back to Messini.
538;This place is terrible. Worst customer service and over priced!! I ordered food and it took over and hour and a half to arrive. When it did it was cold, and soggy. I have lived locally for years and am warning everyone do not order, or eat here.
539;Food is mediocre at best customer service is absolute sh*t. Ordered a chicken souvlaki, arrived with no chicken in it. Also took 20 minutes for them to come back with the correct order while my partner's food sat there cold as he waited for me. Hire more staff to suit your customer needs rather than one person doing the work of hosts/server/reception. Better restaurants on the Danforth.Note: I wrote this exact review on their Facebook page. I made a typo and said "Ordered chicken souvlaki and arrived with chicken in it" (I meant to say "arrived with NO" chicken in it). They replied to me the next day mocking me saying "if I ordered chicken and received chicken, I'd be upset too." Obviously I wouldn't just complain for the sake of it I had reason. Thanks for showing how professional you guys can be.
540;Ordered a simple meal for delivery. Food arrived late and cold. Missing one item and another was wrong. Not spending money here again.
541;Worst place ever. Ordered about 40$ worth of food with my boyfriend. Wait time: 2 hours. Food? Specified NO CHEESE on one wrap as there was an allergy. It came with cheese so I could not eat my wrap at all. The rice was eh, the potatoes were inedible as they tasted like they were crusted in straight up salt, and the fries were cold and soggy. Worst waste of money ever. Ended up having to grab other food cause I couldn't my wrap or the other food. Wouldn't order if someone forced me to.
542;Would not eat here again! I came here at the recommendation of a friend who said this place was better than Messini's. Boy was she wrong! This place does look much cleaner than Messini's but the food was awful. I wouldn't even eat here if I was completely wasted, starving, and nothing else was open. The food was crap. The service was crap. The prices seemed higher than Messini's as well. The only reason why I give it a 1 star is because they have a little patio. If you are hungry stick to Messini's--although the customer service sucks at Messini's, the food is reliable and good.
543;This noce and cozy restaurant with clean kitchen today dropped from a 5 to a 1 star.I would  go weekly with my dad because the food was a good serving size and they had the best lemon potatoes in town.  Not to mention we used to go to messini but the service there has gone downhill so this little spot was perfect for us.A few weeks ago though i ended up with these roasted potatoes. Terrible. Not even cut. I fgured they ran out. Today i went to order a bunch of gyros and was just told they dont have the lemon potatoes. They had the small potatoes. Lazy mans version and i didnt even want to try them again because they were horrible two weeks ago. Quality went down.Did I mention their proces also went up by $2 each for gyros but the website still reflects old prices.Not going there again. They het your business and now how cares. Wont go.
544;Terrrrrrible service.   Offends me as a Greek.  I went in to order & they ignored me for about 5 min.  A "hi, be with you in a minute sir" would be nice guys!  Food is ok, but u won't survive with such S*^t service.  If u ask for something different or extra, good luck getting it with these clowns!  My wife recently had a similar bad experience. never again.
545;Don't waste your time w these rude people. Honestly. They treat you like crap and yell at people and their food isn't handled well and has zero consistency you never know what you're getting. You literally don't get what you order most of the time for takeout. The owner yells at his servers in front of people. They're disorganized. They forget to make your order in the cue. Last time I went I was waiting in line and I saw the old guy owner on the grill reach his bare hand into a prep tub of tomatoes to pull out a hair and then use the tomatoes in a gyro right after. I walked out and I haven't gone back since. Tonight I went in to pick up an order giving them one last chance and same thing:No hair nets. No gloves. No hat on cook. His bare hands fishing in food after touching sweaty forehead and face. Ew. Food we got home, which I didn't even feel like eating anymore, was inconsistent again and a new fun ingredient they add to skepasti and gyros now is 'Greek sauce' which is thousand island dressing. Wh
546;This place sucks. I have given them a lot of chances, but I'm just done. The people working there have generally been extremely rude to us, for example they used to have vegetables on the menu as a side dish option and when I ordered them they made me feel stupid for asking as though I should have known. They are not very clean, the cooks are sweaty and use their bare hands. The service is slow (upwards of 30 min) and on two occasions I have seen their Greek friends or family who ordered after us get their food first. You are made to feel like an outsider. The prices are very high ($12 for a village salad) and portions not very large, better to just go up the street to Folia or Greek Grill, or to Danforth for any of their places. Really, go anywhere but here.
547;Ordered a chicken souvlaki pita wrap to go.  The chef seemed angry and was yelling at everybody.  I'm guessing he was the boss.  Maybe that was his way of talking to the employees.  Everyone seemed stressed out cause of this guy.  There was a lot of confusion behind the counter, and the cashier looked lost when I ordered.  So much that after I ordered, she handed me my receipt.  Then I handed her the money cause she thought I had paid already.  She was like 'oops!'.Finally the chef made my wrap.  Almost forgot to add the fries to it.  Overall, the wrap was tasty.  For $8+tax, I'd rather go to other places around the Danforth.  The portion here was much smaller.  Not worth me ever returning again.C.L.
548;I have never written a yelp review. Ever. This establishment forced me to. I honestly don't have high expectations about ordering food at 11:30, but when it comes two hours later, and after a shakedown by the delivery guy by phone after calling justeat to get a refund, I feel like the only Greek I got had nothing to do with food.
549;I don't know what is going on with this place , They don't EVER listen to what you ask for. E-v-e-r-y single time I order here they mess up my order completely and skimp out on half their food. They literally couldn't care less about their food or job or restaurant and is sadly shows.
550;Usually my husband and I like to post only positive reviews but the experiences that we have had at Tzatziki have been the worst that we have ever encountered in all of years of frequently dining out.It is a little neighbourhood place to stop and grab a bite. I am sure the food is fine, it is the service that is deplorable. We have given this spot three tries, because it is new and we are forgiving.Tonight there were 5 servers on, they all stood at the counter and stared at us, muttered to each other. Not one of them smiled, said hi or told us they would right over. We sat for about 10 minutes with 5 servers buzzing around us acting as if we were invisible. Two men came in down behind us and their order was taken immediately. HUH?!?! That was the last straw for us. You blew it Tzatziki!
551;Early on, this place was pretty good.  The food was pretty decent and fresh.A short time after, everything started going downhill.The service is decent but nothing to give a 20% tip over.  In fact, I feel like 15% is unjustified at times.The food, well, it's pretty crap.  The gyros are always dry and at times taste as if they're days old.Same with lemon potatoes.  You can tell they're not fresh because they have slime all over them, and are mushy -- they definitely look and tasted days old.  One bite, and you'll spit it back out.  A complete abomination.And the rice, so far, the theme has been days old.  Why should it change?It's tasteless, bland, dry and really nothing else to it.  So easy, a 5 year old can make it.  Hard not to guess the ingredients are rice, water, and a knor cube.  No different than boiling down a package of Mr Noodle.  What a scam.The food and the prices are a reflection on the complete stupidity and idiocy of this operation.
552;Ordered take out. Saw the cook sneeze over the grill full of souvlaki. That was an omen....But it was not my food he sneezed on so I took my chances as I was hungry. Grabbed my food and left. Once I got home we discovered they shorted us a greek fries. Called back and after some prodding they offered to deliver us the missing dish.  We gave them the address. In short it took close to an hour after to get our greek fries. They went to the wrong address and then yelled at my girlfriend over the phone, lied about getting a flat tire ( we drove to the spot they said he was stuck at) Bad experience overall. The souvlaki was dry and overcooked. There are soooo may greek places in this neck of the woods. Give this one a pass.
553;Not really friendly and it takes forever to get your order, food is not as good as expected and expensive according to quality
554;So it was my first time eating here. I ordered delivery, 1 pork souvlaki and 1 chicken souvlaki dinner. For starters when I called I was placed on hold for about 5 minutes. The girl I spoke to was rude and clearly more occupied with somebody/something else. She screwed up my phone # twice, my name and worst of all our orders (both of them). This was the saltiest thing I've eaten in a long time. I would not go again.
555;Tonight, after getting home from a vacation to Cyprus and being absolutely exhausted from the airport experience and the timezone difference, we decided to do something we had already previously decided never to do: order from tzatziki again. Past visits had led us to that decision because of the insane prices and much better options in the area. But we just wanted to get something into our mouths by putting in as little effort as possible, so across the street was the best option. I called and asked for a large pork gyro dinner with potatoes and instead of rice I asked if I could just get extra salad. The woman on the phone responded in a friendly way, sure no problem and told me my order would be ready in 15 mins. I sent my boyfriend across the street 15 mins later to go pick it up and he comes back quickly with food in hand, $18 less in pocket. We open it and notice three things: this is a small meal, not a large (we have recently had the same meal) and there are no potatoes and certainly not extra salad
556;we tried to order some of the starters (the spreads/dips which they were advertising as house made and was the only reason why we decided to go) and were told they were out of ALL OF THEM them as the delivery truck didn't make it that day. I said oh, i thought they were house made and the poor girl turned bright red and looked very befuddled and stammered something like, oh they are made somewhere else and brought over....anyway, not promising start and we felt bad for her, we wanted to leave right then but didn't want her to feel bad (why do I think like that??). anyway, frozen fries, dried out chicken, limp, cheap ubiquitous salad, no taste tomotos and a very sad chicken souvklaki sandwich later we left never to return
557;Have been coming here since it opened last year. Last summer this place was a guaranteed 3-4 stars (consistently). In recent months, however, their food has not met 3 star standards. They have also raised their food prices quite a bit, which unfortunately, no longer correlates with the quality of food. Too bad, as they really had a good thing going there for a while -early success may have gotten to their head? If you want an authentic, reasonably priced gyros, head a couple of blocks south to Suv Like.
558;I definitely do not recommend this place because of the attitude and condescending behaviour of the owner. I once was a regular here, and have visited more than once a month for sure, because it's the closest Filipino takeout place from me.  However, when I complained the food I had purchased was raw and I had to throw it out, he told me to prove it, drive back home and get it, hereby indirectly calling me a liar.  I threw it out by reflex but then kept the other items, which were ukoys because I had to go back they can't take my money and give me nothing for it, I expected a replacement or a discount.  I did have the Ukoy with me, as evidence, but the other was already sitting in the trash.  When I showed the raw Ukoy he took it shoved it in my face and said it's cooked, when the middle was just wet flour still.  How rude! All this done with angered movements, raised voice and condescending glares.  It was not cooked, at least not for me.  What's wrong with him? Why can't he just remedy the situation either
559;I strongly do not recommend this place - all meat dishes here are so fatty - I felt sick just looking at the two meat dishes  I bought once I got home (Caldereta and Beef stek as they call it back home)  and didn't bother to eat and ended up throwing it out - owner/cook didn't use proper beef parts for their "beef stek" dish  - and on top of that it was a tough meat! Complete disappointment! I would advise a healthier way of preparing these awesome Filipino dishes- as most of us here are more health conscious now a days but don't necessarily want to isolate our cultural food from our daily food intake.
560;I completely agree with the previous review made by Val Y. I've been here twice, which were both not a pleasant experience. The first time I tried this place was last December. They seemed quite unorganized and there were a couple of people handling the food, and all of them did not know the prices. We had some leftover food (still a full container) that we wanted to take home, and the lady there took our food and said she'd pack it, but ended up throwing it away. When we asked for it, she said "oh sorry, i didn't know". In other restaurants, if they made a mistake like that, they would be courteous and offer something in return.. but they didn't.After that incident, my family decided to give this place another try, 6 months later. They still seemed unorganized with their prices. A lady was taking our orders, along with the owner in the background. First, we ordered a large "bopis", and asked how much it cost, the lady said $8.00, so we said okay. We also ordered a bunch of other things, along with the bo
561;DON'T EAT HERE!  FOOD POISONING TWICE!!I am a long-time customer of Inihaw Grill (3 yrs in Mississauga).  The food has never been great.  Just ok due to cheap, fatty cuts of meat, not very flavourful but the price is reasonable enough & it's convenient when you don't have time to cook Filipino food.  My kids & husband do not like Filipino food so I came here occasionally to get my "fix".  Two years ago I ordered a catering tray of pansit noodles for a family function.  No one could eat it.  It smelled & tasted (that first fateful bite) as tho' it had been oversprayed with Mr. Clean!  I told the owner about it the following week.  He apologized & just shrugged it off.  No refund offered, nor did I ask for one.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt.  Perhaps a one-time mistake.  But periodically after eating my usual combo:  kare - kare stew (beef, beef  tripe, eggplant, green beans & peanut  butter), dinuguan (pork in pig's blood) & pansit noodles, my stomache would feel a bit unsettled.  I thought it was due
562;I'd give this place 0, but Yelp is kind enough to ensure the lowest rank is 1*. What a shame... All I can say is, that this is the ABSOLUTE WORST.... I repeat ABSOLUTE WORST Filipino restaurant in the GTA. None of the other ratings and comments in here are exaggerations. This establishment makes a complete mockery of the dishes they are trying to present. I pass by this place every time I go for work, and I decided to stop by to check things out (I hadn't checked the reviews prior to going). Food uses the lowest grade cuts (literally scraps). There is no attention or continuity between the owners and workers. Overall, this restaurant is sloppy.I feel extremely embarrassed and sorry for the people who have to run this place. It doesn't seem that they understand what quality food or service is.Absolute garbage. I wish them luck, and hope they change.
563;Got baklava to go it was not fresh at all and the manager /owner told me to microwave it!Never again
564;Slowest place ever. Do not come here. Was hoping to grab a quick meal but waited for take out for 40 mins. The staff is incompetent and inefficient. I saw the waitress spill sauce on the ground and it was still on the ground until I left. Worst place ever
565;Just ate it and the Chicken is extremely rubbery. Everything else tasted like it was really low quality, which I shouldn't be surprised as it is a Mr. Greek after all. I can't really say I had high hopes for this place and Can't wait till this closes in 6 months. Everyone in Cityplace hopes a breakfast joint opens like a Sunset Grill as this area desperately needs something like that and not a cheap fast food chain.
566;Waste of time waiting around for our orders. Staffs were so slow and got confused about the orders. Go elsewhere
567;Don't waste your time. I had the Chicken Slouvaki dinner, which included "Mr Greek Potatoes" I was expecting a chain level of quality...I was sadly disappointed. Lets go item by item:The Grilled Chicken: most decent part of the dinner. It was charred nicely and held enough flavor to support the chicken individually. Mr.Greek Potatoes: Over cooked. Not flavorful. In a kind of red/tomato sauce, with the tomato sauce you'd think there would be an additional heap of flavor but sadly there was not and seemed to only hinder the potato and add to the overcooked mushy quality of the piece. Salad: It was okay, but over seasoned with oregano. The only thing worse than an under-seasoned plate is on that is over-seasoned. there was sadly no rice included in the dinner as most chian greek places seem to carry. WORST by far is the "garlic seasoned bread"...now, being a greek restaurant I would assume there would be any other kind of bread then a hot dog bun. Its straight up a hot dog bun that has been buttered an
568;Poor service and bad quality food... Waitress got three of our orders wrong and took forever to do anything. The food was quite honestly gross. The greek salad and the garlic bread were soggy. The menu is also very confusing and doesn't describe anything well, for example, we ordered food expecting one thing and a totally different thing came. I do not recommend.
569;Very bad for take out.  Arrived at 9:50PM to the restaurant and it was not busy at all. I immediately placed a small order for poutine for take out. Got my food at 10:40 PM.  But whyyyyyyy? I don't know...
570;Ordered a plate of wings and bruchetta ...took an hour and half to get food...and the place wasn't that busy. Ridiculous. Will not be back
571;For many times now, I specify "egg and cheese mcmuffin, NO MEAT." They repeat it so they heard it, and it's also in the receipt. But time and time again, I keep getting a sandwich with meat in it.
572;Usually McD's is very consistent.  This page definitely pushes the limits with poor service. Cleanliness and speed.  The washrooms reak to high heavens. Tables all have garbage. Floors littered with food stuffs and the attitude of workers is the I don't give a hoot type.  This is an embarrassment to the clown empire.
573;I asked them for two medium fries at 10:00 AM, they almost made them, but when they realized I had the monopoly tickets they told me to wait till 11:00
574;The people at this location always mess up my order.  Completely incompetent,  save yourself the trouble and go to another location.
575;Every now and then when I order coffee at this location's drive-thru I get the sweetener separate (not in the coffee) forcing me to find a parking spot so I can try to get the sweetener into the cup without making a mess. Why would I pay $1.75 for coffee I have to make myself?!?
576;We were looking forward to this new local breakfast restaurant. Unfortunately we never actually got the opportunity to eat there.  Our group walked in, and right away the waitress was very confrontational. We seated ourselves, because she couldn't be bothered to seat us.  She was very rude and abrupt, so much so that we ended up walking out of the restaurant before placing any orders. This experience has put a very sour taste in my mouth, and I will be sure to relay the message to all my friends and family in the area. I honestly feel bad for the owners of this establishment. They have permanently lost a large group of customers because of one very bad experience with a rude employee.
577;The stove area is dirty a lot When asked to clean it up the pretend the did not understand . Was so happy a breakfast place was coming to the neighborhood.  DISAPPOINTED
578;One of the most disorganised and frustrating McDonald's I ever go to. I have been to this location many times and many times they have gotten my order wrong and cheated me. One example being I ordered a sausage egg mcmuffin and a bacon egg meal and receiving both with sausage. That was annoying. But just today I got a sausage egg and they gave me without my egg ripping me off and basically stealing from me. Their staff is not well trained and can't seem to keep track of orders whether they have 10 customers or 2. This location needs to shape up or a new location should be created. Maybe on Eglinton between Kipling and Martin Grove would be nice.
579;This is not the first time I have had a issue with this particular location. From food quality to service, but this is absolutely the worst experience I have ever had.I ordered a Big Mac to take home and when I opened the box, the smell almost knocked me off my chair.I turned the burger over and the bottom of the bun was full of the most smelly mold I have ever seen. Silly me, I actually brought it up to my nose to smell and 1 hour later, I still cannot get the smell out of my nose. This was disgusting. How can a restaurant not see this on their bun prior to assembling the the sandwich.I feel like I am about to throw up and have been choking it back ever since.Took it back and all they did was refund the cost.True class McDonalds... True classI would not recommend this location to anyone as I mentioned, this is not the first time I have had issues at this one.I just wish we could post a photo of this here
580;Food is like any other mcdonalds, however when I arrived there at 10:30pm they seemed to have run out of a lot of hamburgers. The venue was very dirty with fruit flies flying around and a dead cockroach lying on the floor. The floors were dirty and the place felt grimey. That mixed with no hamburgers to provide made this trip unpleasant.
581;Worst mcdonalds i have been to in the GTA. Very rowdy unsettling environment, extremely slow getting food, looks pretty dirty aswell and employees have attitudes and don't seem trained at all whatsoever.
582;I went here with my brother, he couldn't even eat his food, he left it, chicken was warm and not even fresh, food including salad seemed mushy. For the high price you assume you are going to get good food, not impressed at all. Sad showing by this place. Not worth going at all with the large selection of other places to go.
583;Stopped in here for a quick bite. Ordered a shawarma pita, potatoes and a drink. The guy tried to charge me the price for individuals instead of the combo deal then looked at me funny when I said it's a combo. There were 5 pieces of potato in the container, which was less than a third full. About 30 seconds after leaving the restaurant there was garlic sauce streaming through the bottom of the bag al over my clothes. It turns out the potato container was put sideways, opening side down into the bag with the lacklustre shawarma.In summary a barely average shawarma, decent but skimpy potatoes, and poor staff. Give it a miss
584;Tried to go to Osmow's and ended up here. The only way to eat it was to wash it down with lots of water. They couldn't even get to stuffed grape leaf right. Don't come here.
585;Honestly the worst shawarma I have ever had ( I have had many!!). It's a lazy attempt at shawarma. Salty, Soggy and flavourless. Not authentic and you can certainly find better options. On another note the service was nice and friendly.
586;Terrible!!! Do not go here. The meat tastes terrible, like its 2 days old or something and waaaay over cooked. We tried both the chicken and beef and both terrible. The chicken was less bad though. I had to pull the meat out of my sandwich and eat the vegetables.
587;The WORST shawarma I've ever had in my life.  The chicken was off and by off I mean rotten.  I bought a combo and asked what came with it and was told a drink and sandwich but they did not advise that you get some kind of potato with garlic sauce.  Cashier told me the price, I gave him money but he did not give me change which I promptly said you still need to give me change and he looked at me like the tip was mandatory.  Let's just say I will never come back EVER!!!!
588;This place is the worst. It was the smallest shwarma I've ever had for 8 bucks and it was soggy and nasty.
589;I would give zero out of 5 stars if possible. I have never been served fries this stale in my life before. I thought I would try the waffle fries as they are seasonal, and I am severely disappointed with what I was given. The fries were cold, hard, and disgusting. Don't expect good quality food from this location.
590;Dirtiest washroom at a McDonald's I've ever experienced before. Wow. Says a lot about the management.
591;Drive thru at night has one lane shut down so if you want to use it you have to block the traffic going through the plaza, very bad and frustrating. So I had to go in, order took a long-time (for fast food) around 10 minutes plus for a big mac combo.  The floor was so sticky I almost lost my shoe when I was finally called to get food.
592;Worst McDonald's ever. The staff is slow and rude. And it's not just one bad experience there. I have been there 3 times and every time has been the same. All of the employees don't seem to care that customers are waiting 20 mins just to place their order and go to work to have fun and joke around in the back.
593;WORST MCDONALD'S EVER!! Stay away. It is very dirty and under staffed. Very disgusting. The washroom, the main area, the drink area(with flat pop) and especially the play area. Vomit and food on seating areas. We felt so unclean being in there, we put our clothes immediately for laundry as soon as we got home!
594;This location is very busy with inadequate seating and slow staff. My basic extra value meal order took over 20 minutes! Avoid on weekends when this place is packed.
595;This is the Manchu Work in Scarborough Town Centre.I have to say the whole experience was a mess. I simply wanted to order 2 types of meat and pay with AMEX. First, I asked if they take AMEX, and with a broken English accent they said "yes". Second, I asked if I had to get rice with the meal, and they said yes, its mandatory. I wasn't thrilled that I had to pay for fried rice but I decided what the heck I was hungry (bad time to make decisions), and I was thinking about Panda Express (an American Chinese cuisine chain).  So, even thought I don't generally eat fried rice and don't like being forced to pay for things that I didn't request, I went for it. Well, once I ordered what I wanted, I went to pay for my meal guess what, they didn't take AMEX. Nonetheless, I paid with MasterCard. I got my fountain drink and meal, and asked my final question: can I get a refill, he said yes for a $1- what a joke.Are they kidding me, a dollar for a refill? This business has no concept of understand the customer nee
596;It's like they want to kill us honestly with this grub from the food court. I'm frequently at Scarborough Town and dread temptation especially when they scream "End of Day, $4.99!!!!" from the top of their lungs. Ashamed to say I've given in here, chicken is that soft kind of gross with bland rice. Plus looking at the photos of the kitchen from here makes me never want to return here for food.
597;The worst!Could not calculate the correct cost.Added additional costs. I have to calculate the cost myself and show them how it's done.Watch the pricing people.
598;McDonald's offers a "coffee" card whereby if you buy 7 coffees,  the next one is free.   However,  at non-corporate stores such as this one,  they will not allow anything but a regular coffee if you use the card.   I buy the same coffee everytime I go to ANY location,  but this location always tries to charge me extra for the 'add vanilla syrup' option I choose.   The corporate advertising campaign shows the guy buying a basic coffee for his first 7, and when he gets his 8th (free coffee),  he orders a fancy coffee. Today,  once again,  the counter person (Crew Trainer) argued with me over the 'add vanilla syrup' option I choose. Simply put, I purchased 7 coffees exactly the same way and I should get my eighth free the same as I ordered the other 7.  Anyway,  they charge $0.30 for vanilla syrup and if you are lucky... You get 2 squirts of syrup.NOTE1:  As a manager or crew trainer,  you should never argue with a customer in front of other customers...NOTE2: Buyer beware Also,  an aside to this... Why 
599;Disgusting experience. After i got my take out bags i asked for some mayo and staff refused to give me some mayo. Like we are talking about a CONDIMENT. They wanted me to go back to the register and pay 25 cents for it. Like are you trying to win customer experience or just dont give a F about what that actually is?
600;This location which is 24 hours now shuts down their drivethru with pylons before 12 am and now apparently closes all together. This has to be a joke right?
601;Easily the worst McDonald's. I try to avoid McD's as a whole given superior options, said, I've had the misfortune of this location on 2-3 occasions, silly me for thinking it might get better. 1. I've had the pleasure of someone's order being processed incorrectly each time. 2. regardless of time this location is perpetually understaffed. 3. Ridiculous wait time (dine-in, take-out, order correction and drive-through) 4. Inability to find seating as the play-place is a zoo and loitering of tween and cheapskates spending a 1.25 on a drink to take up a booth and surf the web. I've taken to supporting alternatives in the area.
602;This is by far the worst location I have ever been too... And I have been to lots of McDonald's located all over the place... They can't get simple things right, and begrudge you of the things they do! This is damn McDonald's, why should they go out of their way to piss off their customers, EVERY VISIT!Stay away from this location, it's not worth the time or headache!
603;Literally the slowest service we have ever experienced!!!Over 10 mins in the drive thru waiting for our 2 small cappuccinos!!! OMG I feel I lost 10 years of my life with this one!!
604;This is the worse mc Donald's at this location , kids meal no toy and now there is a wait for 30 mins after ordering food at drive through
605;Yelpers, double check your order before leaving, these idiots cant get anything right to save their lives.. Always something wrong, missing.. Its only this location, most other tim hortons habe reasonable seevice, but this location is horrible.. Also, if u have diabetes and order your drink with sweetener, do yourself a favor to avoid a coma... Get your tea/ coffee black and sweetener on the side, as no one sent the mo to these idiots that there is a difference...
606;Literally the worst Tim Hortons I've been to. They are so slow like so incredibly inefficient. I was in the drive thru lane for about twenty minutes to buy one drink and I came late to work. Usually I'm a patient person but this happens on multiple occasions. There have been countless complaints and yet they still choose to not fix anything. Unbelievable.
607;Worst coffee ever, wasn't drinkable at all. Food wasn't good either. I asked for Nutella banana crepes, as I went there early morning before catching my plane, they didn't have it so they brought me pancakes with beacon...  Keep walking and stop at Starbucks instead!
608;Pretty bad, even for an airport bar, the only reason they have customers is because they are one of the few bars (if not the only bar) in this section of terminal 3.  Waiters display attitude, food is very questionable, and if you are not getting the service from your waiter and ask another waiter for help, they will make a point of calling your original waiter rather than serving you.  I really hope some of this feedback gets to them eventually and they either change or get replaced by another brand.  I agree on the comment about eating at the bar though, it did look very friendly and fast.Just make a few steps forward to get 14, and you will find a perfect alternative, excellent and fast service and great food.  Don't settle for this urban bar if you don't have to.
609;Never Again!I ordered chicken strips, waited 35 minutes to find out they were never coming. THEY ARE SOLD OUT!Best part the time it took to communicate that to me took up all the time I had to get food. God help the person sitting next to me. When I'm hangry, I'm Hangry.
610;Ridiculous establishment. We grabbed something from the to go cooler and then waited in line over 20 minutes to pay for it. One staff member working the entire bar and the people trying to grab and go. This is an airport, people aren't out for luxurious time, there trying to grab a bite to eat between flights. More staff desperately needed.
611;Got the Yuppie wrap:Thick-cut bacon definitely not thick-cut and barely any bacon.Hand-cut fries in the wrap definitely not hand cut.Sliced avocados in the wrap, none to be seen. Just a tiny smear of avocado "dressing."I pointed that out to the server. "Oh we never put sliced avocados, always only avocado dressing."Right, okay. Just blame the menu then. Oh well, airport food.
612;If you're looking for The worst service available, be sure to eat here. It'll only take 25 minutes to bring a cold soup and grilled cheese. Then the waiter will gladly make fun of you for sending it back. I'd rather have eaten airplane food.
613;The service here is horrible. I ordered to go and was asked to wait by the side. So I went to their side area where the tables are located and the waitress in charge of the tables looked at me with disdain and told me to get out of that area. I told her I just had ordered and she told me the seating wasn't for me. Mind you there were at least 6 empty tables that seat at least 4 people there and there were only 10 people using the bar area and 3 other tables. This is also a place that is open seating so why would she be so bothered by me just sitting in one of the many open tables. She could have asked me nicely. Instead she was rude and condescending. It's not like they have a sign indicating it's only dine-in seating. Also this is located in the airport it's not some fancy restaurant. It's over priced average food. $14 for a grilled cheese that looks and taste worse than what I make at home. Avoid this place. Go to the burger place just a couple gates over instead.
614;I generally avoid airport restaurants, unless it's a Chili's that serves cheesy nachos and/or it offers free wi-fi so I don't have to pay Boingo a dollar for every byte of data transmission in an act of desperation.Speaking of desperation, a delayed departure prompted my colleague and I to try Urban Crave.  "Authentic street cuisine" did sound inviting.  And the restaurant has a welcoming open layout.  My colleague chose the buckwheat (soba) noodle salad and fries (no, they are not ribbon chips as advertised).  I was in the mood for a grilled cheese sandwich complemented by tomato soup, and was conjuring up memories of always enjoying the combo at Bouchon Bakery as we waited for just a short while for the food to arrive.  The fries and sandwich barely passed muster, but the noodles and soup were inedible--certainly not something you would list as your last meal on your star-studded Yelp profile (no, that is not a reference to mine).What followed was hilarious.  Seeing that we barely ate, our server came b
615;This place is TERRIBLE. Very slow. My wife got her breakfast, which was not as described in the menu. It was cold. Took about 20 min to make eggs. Mine came 5 minutes later. Guess pancakes are more difficult to make. Avoid this place if you can
616;Went for breakfast and got the yuppi wrap.  Took forever to take my order, the place wasn't that busy but all staff are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  It was seat yourself but only a few tables were actually clean.  The wrap is basically a larger version of a McDonald's breakfast wrap.  No slices of avocado and thick slice bacon is just regular bacon slices.
617;Omg that slider was disgusting. I still ate it but it was nasty. I also noticed another person leaving the 'cheese steak' after taking one bite. If I wasn't so lazy I would have left it and gone to the magazine store to buy some 'nuts'.
618;Food served on newspaper is a bad idea, especially when eating eggs. Didn't help that half my food was cold either, even after sending it back. Not impressed.
619;Seriously one of the worst restaurants (and I'm not sure it deserves that title) I've ever tried to eat at. Service is slow and bad. The food is rubbish, grilled cheese with processed, semi-melted cheese and bland greasy tomato soup. Do not eat here. You'll regret it.
620;Their IPA tasted like Bud Light - zero hop taste.  I questioned the bartender he told me it was from Nova Scotia and it's very light, so that  means Nova Scotia has no idea how to make IPA, or these guys were serving Bud Light which was only other beer on tap which I think is the case.
621;The service is pretty mediocre. But not all servers are. I just got really unlucky. Tables next to me came after me and ordered after me. Yet all three of them got the meals before and when I asked my server about it, she had an attitude. I fly LA - Toronto once a month and always at this terminal. Will not eat here again.
622;I always come here and of course the food is as good as any other Burger King but there's some stuff about this place that kind of sucks :( :- 3/10 times I'm here there's some smelly guy who's asking for change from people standing in line, and although the manager kicks him out he waits a while then just comes back in.- they no longer have the big ketchup dispensers, and if you want extra ketchup you're gonna have to bug the cashiers- the one time I used the washroom it was really dirty :( maybe that's more the people's fault than it is the burger kings...how can people be so nasty if there was anywhere else I could get my whopper Wednesday's I definitely would go there :(
623;Not only did it taste better when I was a kid, but, nowadays, I feel ashamed every time I walk into a BK,  This one especially.  It's dirty, no one seems happy.  The washrooms are filthy. The good is barely edible.McDonald's beats these guys every time (I feel guilty instead of ashamed).But if you're on YELP looking for a burger, you're obviously not thinking this will be a great spot.  Just pick Chinese instead.  Mother Dumplings or almost any other of the Chinese spots in the area.
624;Cold food, vegetables looked wilted. The rice was off the charts oily and spicy, and the place was empty. You think with the lack of customers they could have cleaned the restaurant, everything seemed---- STICKY!
625;Well I went in to hope to get a decent size portion but NO! I went at night the lady barley wanted to put any meat or topping on my dinner. If I asked for something extra like more onions, she made me feel guilty.  So I tried in the day. And again another tiny portion. I asked for more Tabbouleh  and they actually picked up one strand of parsley.  When I notice cheap spots that don't want to give a good portion.. I leave and never come back... I did that with the last 4 places that were in this exact location prior. I AM DONE HERE!
626;Two things:1) The place is dirty with a capital D.  This place is owned and staffed by a bunch of "muslims" as evidenced by the gaggle of hijabi women running the place, but their philosophy pertaining to cleanliness is anything but muslim.  I've seen now twice in a row, over a span of a week, in the back, a bag of garbage sitting untouched next to a disgusting mop/bucket combo.  I've also seen twice in a row, over the span of a week, their toilet filled with used toilet paper, dirty sink, a sponge sitting next to the toilet on the floor as if someone left mid cleaning.  It's disgusting.  All the tables are sticky.  I am doubtful of personal hygiene habits too, so eat at your own risk.2) The food is tasty, but the service is awful, they just don't understand how to wrap a shawarma so that it doesn't fall completely apart when you tear open the wrapper at the top, they JUST DON'T GET IT.  Secondly, I heard another customer tell the cashier that he wants a frequent customer card and she just didn't understa
627;Wow....I wouldn't have thought you could serve such a HORRIBLE breakfast but if you want totally inedible food, it is here. Really awful :(
628;Horrible service... Waited 45 min never got our food... It wasn't even that busy... All I wanted was breakfast...Then I was expected to pay $14 for orange juice and really bad coffee.... Unfortunately I will never go back there again... On another note went to Boston pizza instead and received amazing service...
629;The food is terrible! Everything tastes bland, worse than fast food or even canned food.Hope I never have to come here again.
630;Honestly, I don't usually give one star but from what you know about me. Bad service = one star cause that trumps everything else. Honestly I don't come here because I know there's bad service here and when people I know wants to come here it reminds me of why I didn't want to come here in the first place. Plain decor + lackluster food + bad attitude = one star. So seeing their "special" menu: some buy one get one free meal 26 bux gimmick makes me think maybe this won't be so bad. You get lobster bisque and can choose two entrees plus drink and "dessert". So we tried to order this where we both want the lobster entree. However we were rudely told by the server lady that we can do the bogof deal but can only order one lobster entree. What kind of bogof deal is this?!? When you can't even order two of the same thing? And it doesn't say anywhere on the menu about this. If it was in the fine print maybe that was fair. So then we had to settle for a second shrimp dish which was terrible. The lobster bisque was f

632;Firefly Seafood and Steakhouse is another Chinese-HK style restaurant at First Markham Place.Yes price is really good... but if you come here for some good cut steak you will be disappointed! I cannot really expect what you get from a $9.99 set dinner!They accepts Visa and Mastercard.
633;This place is the worst display of service ever imaginable. They are the definition of cheap and rude. Me and my friends went in and they almost did not give us the student special dispite the fact that we are all students under 18.  The server was rude the entire time and the moment after we sat down, he walked over to the kitchen and was like "fucking student menus again". The food was okay but if you want better you can just go to McDonalds. Some of their specials are limited to one dish per table and most of their deals aren't available if you don't spend enough money.  This is the second time we've been here and I am not sure why we came back to this garbage dump.  The first time we came here, after we tipped the server 10%, she asked us for more and asked us why we didn't tip more.  I don't know the laws about not paying but if I knew them I would not pay for this shitty experience. Avoid this place at all costs.
634;My last experience here was terrible.  Food was so-so but HK style food is nothing gourmet anyways.  But the main reason I gave this place a 1-star rating was the result of poor service and horrible attitude from the servers.  They obviously do not ask their servers to be polite.  It feels as if they are paying for my meal and I should be forever grateful to them for serving me food I ordered and paid for.  Will not ever go here again for bad service.
635;I only yelp when I receive terrible service. I am no picky customer but when the servers are being rude, it's something that I can not stand.Maybe I misunderstood the servers humor but none of us (7 people) found it funny. To me, it was quite offensive. That is not a way to treat a customer and most of us pretty much agreed that we will not visit this restaurant..at least for a long long time.  At the end,  they were pretty much pushing us out of the door. When we leave, we asked him when they were closing. The waitress reply 12am. However it was indicated at the door that they close at 12:30am. I guess either the sign is not up to date or their staff just want to leave early. Way to do business,  you just lost customers.
636;We order a set dinner for two.The Lobster Bisque is so salty, or too much MSG,  and is not consumableThe Tiger Shrimp in Garlic with Fillet of Sole in cream sauce came with cold veggieThe sauce for the Tiger Shrimp in Garlic with Fillet of Sole in cream sauce cannot even classified as sauceIt is cheap, $24 for two, but still I won't go back because of bad food and bad serviceThis restaurant used to be one of my favourate (
637;The price went up sooo much here and the service is truely lacking. The waitress confused herself with the order then started yelling at us. Last time i will ever come here.
638;This place does not even deserve 1 star. The service was very disappointing. My waitress was playing with her phone and it was almost impossible to get their attention. Not only that, she was giving me attitude for no apparent reason. Food was okay. Service was not. I would never go back there again. Ugh
639;Like many people who have posted on here, Firefly offers big food for low price. Other than that, there really isn't anything else going for it. The service here considering the amount of table turnover they were having simply wasn't enough. It took us a while just to get some attention so that we can have our order taken. After our order was finally in, we got our bread appetizer which was warm, but sadly it only came with one butter. 2 breads with one butter. I asked for another one, and they said fine. Eventually our other appetizers borsch and cream soup came, out of the can soups no doubt. but sloppily put in the bowls and you can tell it spilled at one point. Come on people, clean it up. By the time I finished my appetizer, my bread was still looking at me while I waited for butter. I asked again, with one waitress said lucky for me she had one in her pocket and walked away. Unsurprisingly, it was all melted. I asked for another. Our Salmon dishes arrived, but with finger prints all over the side ed
640;COCKROACH ALERT! I ordered a bowl of noodles today. There was a small cockroach floating on the soup. Stop going here until they clean their kitchen!
641;Ever since they changed the chefs (happened in the middle of last year or so), this place has taken a 90 degree tumble in terms of food quality.What used to be one of my favs, the sirloin beef in korean spicy noodle soup, the beef is now rock hard, and the noodles are mushy. It used to be round, just like how images would show in an instant noodle package.The steak itself has also grown hard, no matter how well done you want it. It's hard regardless.The amount of missed orders has also increased significantly. Twice in the past three times at least one part of our order never showed up for over 30 minutes. And when it did, it was either overcooked, dry, hard...basically I would've been better off cancelling the order.Nevertheless, I don't know why I still come here. Maybe the free wifi, but still.
642;Mediocre food with terrible service and even a little racism to really ruin my experience. Not worth it for the few bucks you save. Steak and lobster is decent for the price, but the pasta and sides are essentially just over-salted garbage. Not even as good as the just add water stuff you get in a paper envelope at the grocery stuff. Although I somewhat expected the food to be kind of weak, I never expected to be treated so rudely and actually get a nasty little taste of racial slurs. I went with my Chinese girlfriend and her parents. The server brought just her and I's order quickly, so as to not be rude, we waited before eating. Unfortunately, the server had forgotten to put my future in-laws order in. When we reminded them we were waiting on the other two meals, they said they'd check on it, but no updates or apologies came as we waited a total of 25 minutes before the parents' plates came. In that time, obviously the first two dinners were pretty cold having been sitting there, being picked at, waiting f
643;I only go there for breakfast. They usually have good waiters but this one time there is this Chinese waitress with long ponytail (pink highlights) who treated us badly. We were there for like 20 mins still no tea on he table. So we asked her for tea. After 10 mins we asked the second time. She literally yelled at as and said "someone is going around with the water YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT OK!?!!?!!" We asked nicely both times and she reacted like we killed her mother. And we paid tips for this kind of "service". What ends up happening was that she had to personally bring the water to us. Why lie?
644;Absolutely garbage.. I usually don't give one stars,  but holy.  My friend got a instant noodle with meat sauce on the late night menu.  The instant noodle looked like a week old and microwaved,  the meat was rubbery and tasted disgusting.  Will never come back and highly suggest you guys not come.
645;The staffs were doing loud construction (Drilling & hammering) for repairing their booth seats while customers were trying to enjoy their dinner.. why couldn't they wait until closing?A few moments after, my friend found a nasty bug in her cold milk tea and the staff didn't offer her any discounts or anything.
646;This place is so terrible and I'll never return again.  Service was mediocre and the food is really below average. Tasteless and bland. The intrusive servers love to gossip about customers (it happened to us and other people as well).
647;I came here on a Friday for dinner. I was starving and was excited to try their 23.99 set dinner. Despite being really hungry, I wasn't able to finish my meal and didn't want to pack it back home (portions are big though) The service wasn't as bad as others here described it, but the food... Had an overload of MSG. We ordered the lobster linguine and the italian sausage with shrimp. Both dishes were super salty, but also had this aftertaste reminiscent of airplane or microwaveable food. The lobster bisque was also very salty and felt more like a gravy than a soup. I think it was overloaded with starch and thickeners. Overall, the most enjoyable part of the meal was the lemon water I ordered at the end and the bread they serve in the beginning. Many glasses of water later... I'm still really thirsty!
648;Worst HK Cafe I have been in my entire life. The red bean drink had no taste, no cream, just melted ice. When I complained, they brought sugar water and told me to mix it well.
649;What can I say.. Food came out frozen. Service is just above mediocre. They missed our order and they rushed the food. Plus the wait time for the food was an hour long.I will not come back ever again.
650;Firefly Seafood & Steak House is one of those very long lasting traditional HK style cafe restaurants, despite its history in Markham, I was very disappointed with the food and services in my most recent visit.I ordered a bolognese spaghetti which is a very simple food item on all HK style cafe menu and they could not make it any worst.  The spaghetti had no flavour and it felt like i was eating water boiled spaghetti with some creamy light red sauce on top.  The drink that comes with it was not good either, I ordered a iced milk tea and once again it felt like I was drinking iced water.Lastly, the service is horrendous, it took the waiter 4 times to write our order AND to give us the bills at the end.  There are WAY better HK cafes within driving distance and I would never come here again.The only positive about this place is their breakfast menus are still okay from what I remember, but maybe that went downhill also.
651;Bad service. Bad food. Stay away! We came in, giving this place a chance but was greeted with bad attitude. Looking the menu over I couldn't see the list of drinks available so I asked the server if he could bring over the drink menu, instead gave very snappy replies I didn't think much of it, & decided not to order any drinks. When our food came, we realized we were only given spoons. I also wanted another glass of cold water. The waiter told me, he'd get it right away, but he forgot. When I reminded him again he said, "you can ask someone's else, you know". I would have appreciated a 'sorry I forgot' but instead he tried to push the responsibility off of himself. The tables beside us never finished any of their food, & neither did we. This is a horrible place to go.
652;This place is very unsanitary.  Here is what you should look for when you enter any restaurant. The floors: a sanitary restaurant always keeps their floor clean at all timesThe washroom: sanitary restaurants NEVER neglect their washroom conditions. The environment: look out for any presence of insects.This place failed on all perspectives. Their service also fluctuates a lot - huge mood swings.  This comes directly on how the owner treats their workers.Not recommended.
653;If it was possible to give 0 stars, I would. I went to this location last night after calling there 6 times to try to place an order for 21 pitas. Nobody was answering the phone. When I arrived and explained I needed 21 pitas, the guy looked at my list and told me he simply could not make the pitas. It was about 7:30 pm, I asked him when they closed and he said 9. There was no line up, nobody in the parking lot, and no other customers around. Why couldn't he make the pitas for me? There was plenty of supplies there. This is absolutely unacceptable service. Go to Pita Pit down the road instead, at least they can actually do their job.
654;Worst pita place I have ever been to. One totally unfriendly, surly guy working during lunch. No thank you from him when paying. Totally skimped me on the meat and the toppings. Got the steak and cheese. When I asked for some feta on my pita he said no because there was "already cheese on the grill". There was barely any. When I asked for some fresh peppers same thing "You are already getting some on the grill". Barely any there. Gave me literally a pinch of lettuce. They only fill up the pita pocket less than 1/2 of what it can hold. At that point I should have walked.I paid over $12 for a drink and a pathetic little pita that I finished in 5 or 6 bites. Wasn't even enough filling to eat all the pita bread so I tossed it as chewing on mouthfuls of dry pita bread is no fun.I will go back to their major competitor next time. You can load up as many toppings as you like and the pita is literally twice the size and for less money too.Extreme Pita alright. Extremely crappy.
655;This is definitely one of the worst locations to get your pizza. Way too expensive ($30!?), missing toppings and way too dry. Have tried this locations couple of times, but definitely won't be coming back. I wish they learned to make real good pizzas!
656;Okay....so since my initial review and earlier positive experience, I've returned for other visits and have to say....I'm doing a complete turn around on this one. Since my first few orders that were stellar, I've ordered again and it's been awful every time. Not just bad, TERRIBLE. The pizzas are dry, like Sahara desert dry. The toppings are practically non-existent and the sauce is even dry which I never thought possible. Today I ordered two pies. I was only going to order one, but I didn't think that was enough for delivery so I got two since it was 1/2 price Monday's and I was feeling too lazy to go out for pho, which had been my initial inclination. I should have gone for pho. Both pies were extremely dry and looked like they'd spent a lot more than 6 minutes out of the oven (this is what Dominos pizza tracker told me had elapsed since the pies were done cooking). I had ordered extra cheese on both, I didn't see any extra cheese, in fact, I didn't see much cheese at all. The crust was dry, the pizzas l
657;So I normally order here and it takes 15 minutes max for pick-up. I usually walk over and works out perfectly. I was put on hold for over 17 minutes and when I arrived they told me they were understaffed and were waiting for mor employees. They could have told me this instead of being placed on hold indefinitely. Also no manager on duty.
658;Ordered from here the other night. My pizza crust was literally uncooked I mean it was still squishy malleable dough. I called back asking for a refund. They essentially told me to fuck myself.
659;Ordered 2 medium pizzas, each with 2 toppings. One was crispy thin crust - it was burnt to a crisp and missing one of the toppings. The other one was terrible, but appropriately cooked. Apparently, when you get cheese toppings, they give you like 3 extra pieces of cheese. A total disgusting rip off. Never mind that the driver couldn't manage to buzz the right apartment number (even though the buzz code was on the pizza box). I couldn't pay online, but could pay with credit card at the door. The machine wasn't working and needed to be restarted before it would accept my credit card. Overall, a total disaster.
660;Pizza was burnt, delivery took more than an hour. The delivery man was rude and didn't smile or greet me in any way, then he proceeded to called me a cheap ass when I didn't tip him. Not sure what he was expecting with that attitude ... but at least try to act nice and never ever criticize a paying customer. I don't know what wages he gets paid, but I work minimum wage too, and you are not entitled to my extra dollars just because the card machine asks for tip.
661;The experience was awful. Last week, I saw a deal for unlimited toppings for a large pizza, which got me excited! Waking up hungover on a Saturday morning, my friends and I decided to order pizza. It took 20 minutes to prepare and over an hour and a half to deliver. When it finally arrived, it was cold. I was expecting the cheesy goodness of hot and fresh pizza, but clearly I received disappointment. Will not be ordering from here again and I suggest the same to all.
662;Wish I could give zero stars. Ordered from this location and received a mildly warm, tasteless, bland pizza with not enough cheese or sauce. Never again.
663;This is based on my last visit few years back.Before owner was changed, it was my go-to-place.After then, forget it.I and my wife were impressed with their cutlet combo so we became quite regular here for long time.With our hefty complement over and over, we came here with my sister's couple and parents without knowing the owner changed meanwhile.Ordered cutlet combo, which comes with pork cutlet, fish katsu and hamburger steak.Then, got pork cutlet only so asked to correct it.Don't be too surprised with what happened.Waiter, who seems to be the son of owner, came back to me and asked whether I ordered correctly.Wow, what an excellent customer service... Really impressed!It wasn't the end of story.That waiter (yeah, it was him again!) took our dishes with angry inhale.He left pork cutlet outside while chef was preparing for other two missing kinds. When the dish was served, pork cutlet was really cold...As owner and chef changed, the overall quality was really bad, too.Absolutely MEMORABL
664;Probably the worst service i've had for years.The waiter was a disaster. We asked for small plates to share as he was passing over the food to us. The waiter smiled like a creep and said "Do I have four hands?" Is this guy FOR REAL? I am determined to never return and would warn everyone not to go.The food was okay. The price is high.
665;AVOID!!!!!Myself and a friend had dinner here, he ordered off the breakfast menu (ham and eggs) and I ordered the fish and chips. Service was slow to non-existent. meals were served without any cutlery and when I requested some, only I was supplied with any, my friend had to ask seperatly and wait even longer.Food quality was terrible, the ham was poor quality and over cooked and while the fish wasn't as bad the batter wasn't quite restaurant quality.That was the end of my dealings with Gabby but my friend went back the next morning to give it another chance. When he went to put cream in his coffee he found that the packet had expired and now half resembled cheese.Long story short if you are looking for a nice meal go next door to Fry Basket, if its a bar you want, there are many others around that are better.
666;First time trying this place, not many thai options around the area so I thought it would be worth trying a very simple dish. I ordered take-out, it was ready in 3 mins...I don't know if that's quality or just that they had it already cooked from a while ago. Got home, opened the container and it was packed full..and no, that's not a good thing. The food has zero taste, the veggies were soggy and the chicken was really gross. Do not eat here.
667;I have been craving Thai lately so had lunch today at Mr. Thai.  I'd been there a couple years ago and hadn't had a good experience but I thought I'd give it another chance.I ordered one of the specials ... Thai Spicy Chicken with Rice with just carrots and corn.  I ate it in rather than getting take-out and it was an extra $1.  It was really bland ... not even close to being spicy.  It was just okay and I didn't feel all that great afterwards. Ken was the server and he was buzzing around the restaurant.I won't be back.
668;I walked in around 11:15 - 11:20. The door was open but the restaurant was empty. I started looking at the menu as this woman walked in and told me that she won't open for another 15-20 minutes. I said that I don't mind just waiting until the kitchen opens (the tables were already set, everything was prepped). She bluntly said that she would rather have me come back.  She seemed annoyed and made no attempt to apologize, accommodate, or explain.     Wow. I've been in the service industry for over 12 years now, and as long as we have everything prepped we always welcome early birds. I don't know if she was just an employee, a manager, or the owner, but with this attitude this place won't last long. I'm not surprised other reviewers are not that enthusiastic either.
669;Food is crap- all rice, no meat or veggies, very bland taste. Brutal. There are much better Thai restaurants in the area with better food and prices. Guy at the front desk was also a nuisance. poor customer service. Don't bother with this place.
670;This place probably has the WORST FOOD in GTA! I dont understand how they are still in business. Hope they go down soon! They are a shame to Thai culture! They are not different than any SCAM or easy theft....!
671;I went here today at about 12:30.  I ordered takeout but had 15 minutes to waste before I had to get to work.  I decided to sit at a table to eat my meal and was told I had to leave and that was not allowed.  The restaurant was empty - all tables available.  But I was not allowed to sit and eat for 10 minutes because I had ordered takeout and that's cheaper than sitting in.  The guy at the counter told me someone would have to serve me if I sat down -- I don't see how that would be necessary when I had already received my meal and had paid. I will not be returning.  This restaurant fails to see that sometimes we can make exceptions to rules - especially for paying customers.  Besides that - the food was also lackluster.
672;Poor service. Hard to have a conversation over the very loud music, a/c and busser moving dishes. Will not be going back. Oh, and the 'Thai' food was what you'd expect from an office tower food court.
673;The corner of Yonge and St. Clair is a hard place to make a living. For every longstanding Seniors or Scallywags, there are innumerable Indian, Asian fusion and middle eastern spots that come and go. High-profile outfits like Terroni get chased away, and some new businesses are strangled in their cribs, shuttered before they see the light of day. Mr. Thai entered this dog-eat-dog corner about a year ago, taking over from the upscale Circle Thai, which closed for "Renovation" two cold, cruel winters ago. Remnants of the old place remain. The signature chairs are still here, in a space half the size of the original. The seats were painted shiny gold-green to reflect the new decor. The paint has largely peeled away. The chairs are comfy, and the menu is cheaper and cheerier. Service is less cheery. Water glasses are filled occasionally, and you're generally left alone-which is great until you realize you've waited 20 minutes for the bill to appear. Food is what you'd expect from a run-of-the-mill Thai joint.
674;Went to this place a couple days ago and ordered a Vegetable Panang Thai curry for take-out.What I found when I came back home was a bowl full of pieces of what looks like the stem or root of some plant (lemongrass? hard to tell). The largest part was at least an inch in diameter and impossible to chew (probably wasn't supposed to be chewed). That part of the dish was inedible and it took me a while to collect all these the pieces and put them aside.I tried to contact the restaurant to ask for explanations, they did not seem to care because they did not even reply to my queries.Will never go back here, even though it is steps from my apartment. I'd rather go to Lime on Eglinton to get a respectable Thai meal.
675;I ordered a peanut satay chicken noodle dish, but I was served a plate of boiled rice noodles topped with paper mâché-looking paste and a sprinkle of crushed peanuts.  My lunch tasted as it looked.  My coworkers' dishes were not as terrible, but we agreed that we would not return.
676;The food at this place is garrrbage.  Ordered tom yum noodles and the beef kebob. Overpriced, chewy, and very poor quality. Avoid. Go to a thai restaurant with real thai/ viet chefs. Avoid this Chinese-run craphole. What qualifies the owner of this place to even cook thai food? Garbage food.
677;Mr. Thai, you've disappointed me for the last time. I won't be returning.Initially, I learned to accept the quality here (I would have originally given it 2.5-3 stars) what kept me coming back was the convenience of proximity... But I can't justify supporting this establishment any longer. In my opinion, this experience has dropped Mr. Thai to below the quality of food found at Thai Express.Tonight's take-out meal consisted of a fresh salad roll and a red curry chicken. The salad roll was fine, other than the slightly-less-than-fresh tasting chicken within.But it was the red curry chicken that tipped the scale. It was grey (when it is usually a light pink here) and tasted decidedly watered down, as though they had begun to run low and simply added chicken stock and a thickening agent. I was not even able to remedy it by adding some of my own paste and fish sauce at home. Horrible.
678;No good. Very bland thai food, not authentic, no flavour, lots of oil. Skip this place.
679;Went here today with my valentine for lunch. When you come for lunch isn't there an expectation that the service is perhaps a little bit faster than at any other time of the day? This way you can get back to work in time. Or maybe it's just me? Regardless, there is nothing express about this place. The service is extremely slow We waited at our table for almost 15 minutes before we were served which made our lunch date extremely tight for time. The food was OK, but could have been better. Keep in mind that I ordered their burger. I will reveal the key to a great hamburger... The bun!!. If you want to make a great burger give me to great bun. Their buns are extremely dry.To their credit, we were greeted when we arrived and were shown where to get a menu to get started. It only went downhill from there. I would not recommend this place if you are pressed for time.I'm also not a big fan of restaurants that serve  ketchup in individual packets. I know, I know... You don't go to a Greek place for ketchup and
680;Found a hair in my food :( Service was rude, I asked the lady if they had any roasted chicken and got an eye roll (My bad though, thought I was at Jimmy the Greeks lol) The place reeked of dirty mop. I love Mr Greek but this location has got to be the worst one I've eaten at. I hate giving bad reviews, but I also can't imagine having anyone else come here without knowing first.
681;this place is great. If you're a hamster! smallest serving size for $15 a plate... This is in comparison to other Mr. Greek chains.
682;I have been to this location a few times. The food is just okay. For a Mr. Greek "Express," there is nothing quick about it. It wasn't too busy when I went yesterday but there were about 4 people waiting for food ahead of me. I couldn't understand why. But when I got my food and my sister hadn't received hers, I saw one of the three girls working drop the fries into the fryer.. the entire time we were waiting, they didn't think to start cooking my sister's fries.We got our food to go. When we got home and my sister started eating her chicken souvlaki pita, she noticed there was no lettuce. It was just tzatziki and chicken. Who forgets lettuce in a wrap?!?! The rice she got on the side was overcooked and 10% was dark and hard. Again, it was not busy and the three ladies working did not seem very attentive to what they were doing. I am not visiting this location again.
683;Yelp needs to allow a NO STAR rating!This place is the worst place I have visited in well over 30 years.  The service is horrific, horrific, horrific.   Save yourself the aggravation and go anywhere but here.  Very disorganized, no leadership.  All levels of management need to be retrained or fired.  Corporate need to pull the franchise if there is a franchisee.  Service here was always below par but the managed to lower the bar further!  A same, considering the food over all isn't bad.  Definitely not worth the wait!  At least they took the"Express" from Mr. Greek.I have attempted calling them to speak to a manager, but get a busy single.  Over an hour.  I'm sure the phone is off the hook.
684;Very slow service, also the store was cold with the drive door open. Food wait was 20 mins but at least it was hot, thats why i give it a 1
685;While I don't expect much service from McD's, this place really annoyed me recently.  We ordered two iced coffees and when we received them, they were as white as milk.  It looked like there was no coffee in them or an over pour of milk. So I asked the cashier nicely and said "is it possible to get less milk in these?" Her response was "that's the way we make them". Sorry, but I've never seen McD's iced coffee that white before.   I don't understand.  What if someone wanted their iced coffee black?  Do you still pour milk in it? Anyways, when we got them back, they were still quite white but I just said "whatever at that point". There was absolutely no coffee taste to it.  Maybe the owner/manager here is trying to pull a fast one over on customers or it was just an innocent mistake by the staff, but I'm still annoyed by "that's the way we make it comment". It's not like I asked for more. I asked for LESS milk. I could care less if it's not as filled, but I just want the coffee and milk ratio to be adequat
686;ive had to move on from this location, and it sucks. the last three times we have ordered for delivery, this location would call us within ten minutes of the order placed, to explain that they were out of a certain topping we requested on our pizza, with no compensation for the lack of food. on a positive note, because we cut ties to this franchise location, we've found other beautiful locations of pizza establishments to spend our money on
687;Depressing location with lonely people staying way too long for the free wifi.  Pizza pizza is the worst of all the pizza options in toronto, other than maybe 2 for 1..  drive to IL PAESANO for real pizza.
688;So underwhelmed with the food here and ridiculously overpriced.Bought siao Mai dim sum plus two wonton soups and was so disappointed. Siao Mai was $8.99+tax for 8 very tiny pieces that weren't that good. I could have gone to OCEANS for better ones and for cheaper.The wonton noodle soup was blah too. Flavour was almost non-existent. Like drinking water.  I remember ordering from them a long time ago (pad Thai) and having a bad experience with absolutely zero flavour and called to complain in a non-aggressive manner with the owner firing back at me in a very angry tone saying too late I paid for it and I can't return and get refund. Considering that, I actually gave them another chance (and my money) and tried out again. Officially the worst Chinese place I've ever been to ever. Don't even bother going.
689;If you're looking for tasteless Chinese take- out, look no further. Food is very empty in flavour and substance.
690;This location was one of the best in terms of crispness and well coating chicken.  Over the past six years since moving to Markham this was to goto KFC!  Something new has changed since approimately June 2015- the chicken is not coated enough with seasoning, is soggy with oil (including fries). If this is a new franchise owner i suggest they go back for training as sales will slowly decline as more and more get dissappointed.
691;Been here a couple of times and while I really like the vintage look and feel, the service and chicken are not up to par. On one visit the woman while taking my order realized she forgot to give the person ahead of me their medium salad. She had it in bag under her hand. Ppl make mistakes but it was her look and chuckle of "oh well" when she told me that really sucks. Shows how little she cared. Second time when I ordered a favorite bucket, all my popcorn chicken were burnt. If you are making this all day how could you not notice the chicken is a different colour and dried out?!   To serve it again shows how little they care. Im going to markville from now on for kfc in Thai area. Yes, I'd rather go into a mall than order here again!
692;Probably the worst KFC ever. Every time I pick up a fries it's cold, not even tad warm. When I tell them to make fresh one they act like they have seen a ghost or something. Today I ordered Zinger sandwich and it looked like they pre heated the same meat again it tasted horrible. I asked her to redo both fries and sandwich.  Sandwich was fresh but chicken was still raw and fries was still cold when I got home. I live about 3 min drive from there.  Anyways never going back again.  This place needs to shut down.
693;Got delivery from this store the order came 1.5 hrs late called up the store no answer the first two times I called.  Got through at 10:30 pm when the store closed and the store manager or owner was very rude, told her the matter and she hangs up on me. My first and last time ordering from KFC.
694;Yes I know. It's dirty bird. What do you expect? Well  apparently, even my low expectations were too high. The good, the bad and the ugly:The good: Great tasting but it's kinda like cheating on your girl with a $10 hooker. You think you're getting a deal but you'll just feel dead inside after its over. The bad: The food is cold and not fresh at all. The ugly: I asked if it was possible to order a bucket of chicken with no drumsticks. If it wasn't, then no problem. But they said 'sure'. She spoke to the "lady" in the back and she looked a little pissed and glared at me. I told her not to worry if she couldn't accommodate the request. The last thing I need is spit mixed in with the colonel's secret recipe afterall. But she said "fine". When I get home? You guessed it. Bucket FULL of drumsticks. In fact there was NOTHING but drumsticks. Now, I understand if they couldn't give me what I wanted despite being a paying customer and being a seemingly minor request. But to go out of their way to stick it to me? 
695;The only good thing in this location is the service. The chicken is getting smaller and smaller in these 5 years. And the prices is getting higher and higher. The food quality is going down to the drain. Even buy one get one free is not worth the money.
696;Honestly, it was just sad. back ribs and wings combo and a side order of "fresh cut fries"Fries: soggy, not salted, no flavor, seemed stale.Now, all you really have to do is deep fry fries, not that hard, so at this point we should have been worried.Wings: tiny, shriveled up, looks-like-they-bought-microwave-oven-wings-and-poured-muck-on-it wings, (of course, no flavour - not like BBQ sauce anywayRibs: Smelled rotten. Tasted rotten. A cup of muck to cover the taste on the side.Never again.(also what the hell is that website UX)
697;Ordered ONLINE delivery service for my husband late this afternoon.Food arrived in very good timing both myself and my husband were impressed with how quickly the order came.  Two chicken legs were the main course.Once he started to have the chicken, he got up to actually compost the chicken.  He, an omnivore, typically never does this with meat-based dishes.He couldn't, however, continue eating it - the taste of the chicken had been compromised, the cut wasn't a good one.There went our dinner meals.  Myself, I had just a side baked potato.  Plus some other homemade options, so I wasn't relying on the same chicken/meal.We had high hopes for tonight's meal.  High but realistic.I ended up calling SC's take-out/delivery number and spoke to someone in customer service.  Two choices were offered - to get the very same exact order again, although we'd have to get back into the compost bin to dig out all the chicken bits to give in exchange.  Or to receive a $10 credit.My husband will never want the
698;Ugh, why did I come here?  Coworker and I were sick of all the options around the Yonge-Bloor area and were looking for something economical.  We go out to lunch way too much and been to practically every place, so we went east past Church on Bloor and originally planned for sushi, but then we ended up joking about Swiss Chalet or McDonald's.  Somehow we actually ended up at Swiss Chalet.  I need to just shut my big mouth sometimes.Atmosphere: 1/5 - this Swiss Chalet looked like an old diner and reminded me of a Golden Griddle.  Yuck.Service: 3/5 - service was fine and nothing special.  No super service, just some nice women serving us.Food/price/value: 1/5 - I ordered a chicken sandwich and fries smothered in gravy.  The chicken was alright, but they even didn't even ask the option of white or whole wheat bread.  Are we living in the 90's here?  Where's the whole wheat option? No mention of it.  Also fries tasted terrible unless you smothered them in gravy.  This still costs me almost $12 with tax. My 
699;Three words for this branchDisgusting, Disgusting, Disgusting. I cant believe that Cara foods have not taken away your franchise and closed you down for tarnishing the name of Swiss Chalet.I moved into the area about two years ago and having since in the past been spoiled by possibly one of the best locations ever Dufferin and Apex shoutout goes to you I move downtown and tortured by this one location.Both the wife and I love Swiss Chalet, its not really a guilty pleasure except for the fries and is better than Pizza if you are not in the mood to cook.I have way too many stories to tell regarding this location but except if you love receiving french fries that have been scooped off the floor or other peoples plates that they have left behind this place is for you.  I have ordered countless times in hope my complaints would get me better food however complete hits and misses. I have been given free meals, replacements dinners etc etc because at first I would give the benefit of the doubt than like ever
700;This is probably the worst Swiss chalet you could order from, from my personal experience. I have ordered from this place 4 times and I had to complain 3 times. The food either arrive cold or is the wrong order. And this time, the manger basically refuse to communicate with me regarding the wrong order, simply because the restaurant is busy. Now I really do feel like I'm paying so that people who are bad at their job, people who bad attitude could keep being the same way.  NEVER AGAIN
701;Just spent $16 on a club sandwich that has no tomato or lettuce on it. Thanks guys, solid purchase. What a joke.
702;I had a quarter chicken dinner delivered from this location on Wednesday and I've been sick for the past three days. I've had food poisoning before and that's exactly what I have now. I will never order from here again.
703;I get it - the restaurant is closed for renovations - but the call centre claimed three times today that they talked to the restaurant to confirm that they couldn't deliver.  And the nearest store for delivery to downtown Toronto was Thornhill - over a 45 minute drive away.Don't order Swiss Chalet delivery for downtown Toronto - and whatever you do - don't call the call centre to try to get the problem fixed.  The worst customer service ever.  Call takers who can't recognize that a store is closed or that Toronto and Thornhill are not the same place.  I had to escalate to a supervisor after three calls and two charges to my credit card.  And the answer I got from him was - sorry that happened, nothing I can do.I have something that I can do though - I can never order Swiss Chalet again.
704;So here it goes .... Sad to see how this chain has gone down the drain over the years... Especially in the last 3-5 yrs.What a disappointment to what used to be a memorable childhood experience .... The quality of the food, the size of the portions and the overall experience just makes people want to stay away from this chain of restaurants. They have expanded their menus but what's the point when there's no appeal.I ordered the new chicken salad and the shrimps, and my friend ordered chicken and ribs. Ribs looked like they were few days old... The knife wouldn't even go thru the meat, it was that hard and inedible. There were plenty of salad dressings  ...I could only eat part of the salad... Shrimps were ok.  The only somewhat decent thing we had was the coconut shrimps. Service is ok, it's the same folks we know and have seen for years and they seem to try their best to accommodate you. (It's really a hit and miss). We sent the ribs back but we weren't even offered a full refund. Just too bad... We 
705;Yikes!  You might want to avoid this Swiss Chalet location. The place is very dark, dirty and uninviting. To top it all off, the service is insanely slow and you are rolling the dice on what food may arrive at your table.  Oh, and if you need to use the washroom, Don't!
706;Let me start by saying I usually LOVE Swiss chalet, however this was my first time in this location and it was AWFUL! so it started off okay the waitress took our orders and delivered the drinks and app fairly fast, however when it came time to deliver the food she set it down on the table didn't clear anything else off and that was the last time She came to our table until it was time to pay. Now our drinks were pretty much finished when she delivered our food and never offered to refill them, never asked how the food was which was practically inedible due to the chicken being so dry and having no liquids to help digest it, she would go to the table next to us and turn (we were in a corner booth) with her back to us at all times so we couldn't get her attention. Finally after finishing -ish our meals we had to find the waitress ask for a box, the cheque and a refill, when she came back to the table reached over an empty glass to refill ONE persons beverage and dropped the box on the table so we could put the
707;OMG. I bought a medium fruit salad & some banana bread for myself & my dad when he was at Western Hospital for knee surgery. My dad went to eat the fruit salad & it was spoiled! I ate the banana bread & it was fine. Anyway, I went back there to tell the guy who sold it to me about the spoilt fruit salad & he didn't seem surprised. He gave me my money back. I asked him if he had anything fresh & he said that's all he had. He didn't even throw away the remaining fruit salad in the bowl where he served me from.  Awful! Save your money!
708;I'm at the Toronto western hospital for my monthly appointment with the clinic. I didn't eat breakfast yet. So I thought I would buy a sandwich from this place. I had a sandwich from a different druxy's before and it was good. Well was I disappointed with this one. The lady was rude and every time she asked me what I wanted. Her back was turned towards me. I had to keep asking her what she said. I ordered a BLT on an onion bun. She made the sandwich and started wrapping it up. I was confused, because your supposed to pick out your topping. When I said something she seemed annoyed. She was in a rush to talk to a guy that was waiting for her. Well I tried eat the sandwich and it was the most horrific thing I tasted. The bun was old and dense, which should have been thrown out. The tomatoes you could tell where from the day before because it was watery and slimy. The bacon was microwaved and thin. It was disgusting. This place is a disappointment and it's a shame. When the food and costumer service is this b
709;During my four years as a high school student at Woburn Collegiate Institute down the road, this was a restaurant we frequented. Looking back, I have no idea why.Food isnt even mediocre. It's actually pretty gross. The rice is stale and dry, the chicken/beef/ whatever meat you get feels like it was made yesterday, and the sauce is pretty disgusting.The atmosphere is akin to the restaurant featured in the Godfather, where Michael Corleone shot those two guys. It feels grim and dark, and pretty ghetto. I legitimately wouldn't be surprised if someone got shot here.The hygiene of the place is great, if you're a director looking for a scene of a disgusting dump. Unmopped floors, smelly toilets, flies all over.Once, during lunchtime hours, when 12-15 students lined up for food, I saw a group of 3 students walk in and call the store owner some provocative names. The store owner then took a broom and chased them out, while yelling some not so kind words. That fiasco lasted over 10 minutes, and I didn't get my
710;These guys install a new order speaker to never use it . The waits in the drive through can be as long as 15 min .When they have free coffee the line goes to the road causing me and others to go to other locations to seem not to have this problem. This location is mismanaged.
711;Fake food, Perfect for fat canadians that are lazy to cook real food. Mcdonalds is pretty much cancer that tastes good but makes u feel like crap lol. By the way its not even cheap. Filled with Gmos
712;Cheap. . Lol... try the toothpick size breakfast burritos. Lol or the ice with pop to go.
713;The manager (assuming the one in the grey uniform) first rudely told me to take back the ticket that I temporary left on the counter because I'm lacing my shoes. When she handed me the older, she didn't even acknowledge me or thank me. The order she handed to in her other hand received a "thank you" and so did every other order before mine. I didn't even mention the part where I got cut in line just before the chaser and no one bothered to point that out. Is it because I'm Chinese? What a great way to start a day. Think twice before visiting this place.
714;I go to this McDonald's regularly and never had a problem. I went though yesterday and there was a dead fly in the fries. Inexcusable!!!!!
715;This Mc Donalds always messes up my order when I go there. The food is like any other Mc Donalds and the staff cam be quite rude.
716;Wouldn't even give it a star. Had to wait 30 mins for an easy order. Staff are rude and slow. Never ever come back.
717;If you want to be sure you got what you order through the drive-thru..... check every item in front of the server.... this place hardly ever gets an order 100% correct.
718;This place recently went under construction. Now the drive thru consists of 2 lanes for ordering that must merge into one in order to pay. Like being caught in a bad ass construction zone in rush hour where the lanes have to merge, (which I had just endured before I got to McDonalds)! I spent 20 minutes in that flippin' line, they almost gave me someone else's order, and I stated point blank I would never be back! I don't even like McDonalds that much, I was just in a hurry! What a mistake! What a mess they made of that drive thru. Drive Thru from Hell! The food tasted as it always does....but I'll figure something else out next time!
719;This is not a standard shawarma place, because you can do so much better almost anywhere else. They're very stingy with portion sizes, and fill platters up with rice. The meat is tough and too thickly sliced, the hummus is oddly grainy (not in a good way) and flavourless and the person making my plate tried to pass tabbouleh off as a mere garnish. Take a 5 minute walk in any direction of this place and you'll find much better shawarma.
720;I ordered the lamb with salad and potatoes . The lamb was stone cold . Brought it back and they heated it on grill for one minute . Was still cold but not only that . It is not really fresh lamb . It is some type of ground lamb (I think) made into a sausage roll . I could feel the ground bones left in the meat when I chewed it . Terrible . It is full of some God awful seasoning and MSG . I was sick the whole day and night after eating this stuff . The salad was old . You could see the wilted and brown edges of the lettuce . Don't eat here . Not good and not safe .
721;Walked in weds Sept 28, music blaring. Slowest McDonald's staff on earth. Messy, depressing. They need a management drop in, terrible.
722;Probably the messiest McDonald's I have ever eaten in. You can expect dirty tables, broken ketchup dispenser, full garbage bins, slow service and screaming and fighting local teens.
723;Came to this place with Bae not knowing what to expect. First of all, there was no hostess there to seat us! So we had to go find our own table. The only free table we found was dirty so we HAD to clean it. And then we waited almost 3 hours before a waitress finally came and told us they were CLOSING THE DINING ROOM?! EXCUSE ME? We could have had 3 meals in that time but now we're absolutely starving and being told we won't have time to eat?! Ridiculous service. Come to think of it, I don't even remember seeing any of the other tables being served either, and eventually all those people just up and left too. I've gotta say, maybe if the staff could up their service a little bit this place would be a hidden gem, the food on the menu looked pretty good. But for now, all I know is that its gonna be a long time before Bae and I decide to return here.
724;Ok, lets start with this..i've visited many locations across the world and nothing compares to my local mc d's. I'm convinced this location is contending to be the #1 worst! It doesn't matter what you order, they'll -A. Mess it up, B. Take eons to put it together, or C. B.S their way out, not taking ANY responsibilities that they are at fault. Unfortunately, i believe all who work there are quite special! Multi-tasking doesn't seem to be part of their training. As for the management, they are also quite useless! I haven't seen them to rectify or deal with any issues..instead they actually hide! How horrific!! This place definitely needs a spring cleaning from top to bottom..too bad the renos didn't fix the staff/service :(
725;We ordered take out and couldn't wait for our food as we were so hungry at 6:30pm on a Sunday night. The girl who took out order was kind and very thorough with taking my order. I ordered hot wings level four hotness, but my wings were more mild and very salty. Two double bacon burgers we ordered did not have any bacon in it the burgers were cold and dry. A chicken quesadilla we also ordered was soggy and falling apart like it was dipped in water. We spent about $70 on this order and it was such a disappointment as the food we ordered was worse than a fast food burger joint. You should've ordered from McDonald's. I have ordered from other wild wings before so I know it's not the company but the location that was terrible. We all didn't even finish our food as the food we ordered was so unappetizing.
726;WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! do not go to this location! I went there once and decided I wanted to wash my hands before my meal arrived to only find out that the restaurant had no SOAP. disgusting! waitress couldn't find soap in the restaurant and that was a major alarm so i decided to leave the restaurant. Before leaving, I asked the waitress how they wash their hands and she did not answer me, and then I asked how would other female be able to wash their hands after using the bathroom and she replied "I don't know" with a blank stare!! But I called the next day to make a complaint to manager by the name of "Nadia" and all she replied was "okay." I called again since i did not like her answer and then she replied "DO YOU HAVE A LIFE?!" with a very mean immature tone of voice! wow!! and she is a manager?!! unacceptable behaviour.  I made a formal written and verbal complaint to head office. poor health and safety practices here! worker's need to get trained better and management needs MANNERS!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE TERM
727;Came here with the softball team after the game and it was a regretful choice.  They did not inform us that they only had 1 deep fryer going and we had a group of ~12 people.  The waitress was clueless.  Basically, half of the group ate while the other half waited and then we switched.  We waited more than an hour to even get the first batch so it was close to a two hour wait for the second.  Then after admitting that there was only one fryer going, she offered us a discount but things got even more complicated she couldn't figure out how to split the bills properly.The wings were dry and the chicken wings were shrivelled.  Just don't go here, even if you have low expectations.
728;AVOID!  Wings were super dry and not well seasoned.   We returned a set of wings and received ones that were worst!  The owners of this establishment should be ashamed to charge customers for their subpar food.  They need to visit the other Wild Wing locations to see what the wings should look and taste like.  Don't waste your money, stay away!
729;This place should be avoided at all costs.Luckily, I was not subjected to the food, but I came here for lunch whilst my two co-workers wanted to try a sandwich.The owner/manager was making sandwiches with one rubber gloved hand and the other hand (not gloved) holding his cell phone while he spoke in Italian for the entire 20 minutes we were waiting. He took orders in between chatting on the phone and never once put it down.One co-worker was given her sandwich immediately and we waited patiently for the second. Waiting...waiting...more waiting. After 10 minutes we enquired about the second sandwich. Oops. He forgot about it.To top off the experience, both claim the sandwiches were fairly horrible. Roast beef consisted of: HUGE bun, not enough roast beef and way too much mustard.Good thing I didn't eat here.
730;Extremely disappointed. Placed an order for pick up, i asked for a beef souvlaki on a bun but for some reason that was not possible... so i got a chicken souvlaki on a bun, i asked for just lettuce, tzatziki and feta cheese which i was charged an extra $1 for. When i got home from picking up my order i was pretty upset cause they got my order all wrong... they gave me a chicken souvlaki on a bun with tomato and onions... which i did not ask for at all cause i hate onions and tomatoes (i know i'm picky) . Plus i don't live close to this place so i would not drive back. I do not recommend this place.
731;I've been to many different Greek restaurants before, it's my favourite type of food, I was shocked at the price and quality of Mr.Greek in Pickering. The meal came to $32 and all we got was a Greek salad with one small piece of souvlaki, and 2 souvlaki pitas. The pitas had nothing to them, 2 pieces of tomatoes and a few onions, the souvlaki was so small a child would be hungry after eating it. My salad was dripping in dressing, to the point that I could not consume the bottom as every piece of lettuce was dripping with dressing. The souvlaki reminded me of Marc Angelos package meat, not authentic at all and I guarantee everything was pre cooked. The restaurant was bare no one was in there and I went at 1pm. It won't be long till this restaurant closes. I will stick to Jimmy the Greek, and Milos Greek in Pickering. So many regrets I have not going to one of those places today for lunch, I'm currently eating chips and dip as I left starving. Total rip off!!
732;I'd read an article about this restaurant in the "Toronto Star" a couple months ago and have been meaning to try it.  Today was the day!For $10, I got the large container and a bottle of pop.  Yes, you can fill it with WHATEVER you want as long as the lid closes.  I filled mine with veggie rice, black bean beef, sweet and sour pork, General Tao chicken, a couple wings and a couple honey garlic ribs.  I had lots of food and there was still room for the lid to close.I tried a bit of it all and left a lot. The food isn't very good. The quality is poor and nothing tastes like it was supposed to. The black bean beef, wings and ribs were blah and the pork and chicken were sickeningly sweet ... the veggie rice was the best thing. Everything had a funky texture and was kind of cold.If I was ranking this on quantity, it would be 5/5 ... you can jam a lot of food in the large container for $6.99!But ranking it for quality, I've got to give it 1/5.In this case, you get what you pay for.  I won't be back.
733;This review is for the location at DAIRY QUEEN BRAZIER325 Central Pkwy W #52, Mississauga, ON.The store is dirty and old, homeless people sleep on the bench in front of the store, and the Blizzards always taste terrible. I will never be back!
734;I usually go to the one in brampton but was close to this one so I'd try it. I ordered a chocolate extreme blizzard. Asked for extra pieces well because I wanted to. I get the blizzard doesn't look nothing like the blizzard I asked for. I was very annoyed. It was vanilla ice cream with chocolate brownies and chucks they didn't even add extra which is what I paid for. I complaint but they told me this was it. I will not be going back to this one. They were in a rush to take your order didn't even give me a receipt and they don't even care about customer service. Such a pain in the ass. Don't go to this place.
735;Not sure how the chain is still alive.I went in placed my order no smileThey where to busy being kids .Order was ice cream it was $5.25I over paid because it was that bad.......They once where the giant but have gone down hillWill never go back to that chain..
736;Disgusting. Even the picture here looks disgusting. Not at all like the Sbarros in the US which are actually decent maybe Canada shouldn't have Sbarro. Pizza tastes like plastic and chemicals and pasta is obvious at first sight as being not cooked in the tradition al dente way and even might be processed or something. Food is lukewarm and sometimes even cold. Do not waste your money here. And oh yeah, bringing me to my last point, it's horribly overpriced. Employees are stupid. A pathetic pre-recorded voice machine announces "Hey there, welcome to Sbarro" to attract patrons passing by who I hope don't bother. Just don't.
737;If you like to eat cardboard instead of pizza, eat there. No customer service, they messing up the orders, overcharging your bill. At least, they are well trained at fooling the customers.Do not go in weekends.
738;I've been here like 3 times since it opened and have not been impressed on any visit. once you select a slice they make it sound like you have to get a combo because "the side and drink are free"... If I say I ONLY want a slice don't make it sound like a combo is my only option then talk up the "free" sides and charge $10.50 once I get to the till... I feel like their workers are forced by management to upsell to customers their expensive combos. I could've gotten chipotle across the street for less and I consider that a treat as far as fast food goes in between classes (I'm a Ryerson student). the food is cold and bland and overpriced, you're far better off getting pizza anywhere else close by. I've had sbarros in Wisconsin and Chicago first (which is the only reason why I tried this location) and it was cheaper and better quality. you should leave Canada if you aren't going to honour the standard set by American franchisees.
739;Bad customer service especially the cashier. She is so RUDE to the customers.  date: June 27, 2017 1pm
740;This was my first experience with Sbarro. Will not go again. I ordered two pepperoni slices. They were not hot whatsoever when I received them. There was no sauce on it and barely any cheese. It was basically just dough with pepperonis on it. The check out lady was not friendly, did not ask me how I wanted to pay - she assumed it was debit and walked away to do something else. I waited for her to come back to tell her it was cash and she was visibly annoyed. Terrible experience.
741;Ugh!  Someone at Sbarro should've apologized to me for selling me this awful lunch!  I ordered the "special" Chicken Parm meal. Price not advertised.  Ended up spending $12.50 for wort pasta ever with barely edible chicken, garlic bread stick and small 7Up.  I didn't even eat 1/4 of it.  Terrible!
742;Overpriced and not good.Had a pizza craving and ordered a pizza slice from here. The bottom crust was soft (soggy) and the slice couldn't hold it's shape or toppings the whole thing fell apart before I could even take my first bite. It was stressful trying to eat it and tasted extremely disappointing, definitely did not do anything for my pizza craving. After googling other pizza joints, I realized pizza pizza was only 5 mins down the block from dundas so went there to get my pizza fix instead
743;Did not enjoy my experience here at all. Yes, I understand that it's in a mall food court so technically I shouldn't expect much, but all the other food places in the urban eatery are much better than this.I went just after 8pm where they advertise buy one slice of pizza, get one free as an end of the day special.  The girl working there almost didn't want to give us the special even though it was clearly after 8pm....kinda confusing. She just had a weird attitude and lacked any customer service skills. Anyways,  she warmed up 2 slices, and both tasted really bad. Dry, no flavour, it was almost hard to get any motivation to eat it....I mean, I think I would've preferred getting a slice if pepperoni pizza from 7-11 for much less! Even with the bogo free deal, I wouldn't recommend it, definitely not worth the $5.
744;Yeah, this was pretty bad and a waste of as starving to death and loaded up with spaghetti w/ meatballs and a slice of pizza to chase it down. The spaghetti was very soft and the meatballs were maybe 3/4 cooked. The pizza was subpar and had looked like it had been sitting around all day but wasn't, it was straight out of the oven. The meal wasn't cheap either, over $20. I can honestly say I won't be back.
745;5.20 for 1 slice of pizza is overpriced to begin with. It doesn't help that it was so overseasoned It tasted like I was eating pure onions in oil and nothing else.
746;It was mediocre at best. Had a Stromboli, which was massive to begin with and then they tacked on two breadsticks for the combo. I'm not sure how they expect someone to eat that much dough. Only managed about 50% of the Stromboli. The quality just wasn't there.
747;This restaurant may be called "simply delicious" but their food should be called "simply unfathomable".  I've eaten so many different dishes on the menu (not that I had any choice in the matter) and each dish tastes like mulligan stew made in the back of an alley by some hobos.  If they offered their food to the malnourished kids in Madaya, Syria, those kids would probably take one bite and say, "no thanks".  Every dish is basically mystery meat in a puddle of oil along with some rice, and I bet if Morgan Spurlock made his next 30-day diet movie eating at this restaurant he wouldn't live to tell the tale of it. It's easy to see why they have to price their food cheaper than McDonald's. I would not recommend eating here unless you actually want to have the "mulligan stew experience". Consider yourself warned.
748;I wasn't here by choice, meaning I didn't select this as the place to cater the food. Did the cooks even go to culinary school?Pilau was mediocre, pieces of stew beef not tender rather chewy. Channa curry was the most bland saag I've ever had, my girlfriend can cook better, curry packages taste better than this.Oh and a little side note, the entrance to this place was vandalised overnight before we arrived. Some thugs threw rocks the size of basketballs through the glass windows. Glass wasn't cleaned up by the time we arrived, rear entrance was opened with very high stairs, no ramp for seniors. We helped some up before I got pissed enough to tell the manager they need to open up the main entrance.
749;How do you give Ruby Thai zero stars with this app?It is sooo terrible, horrible, no good, a very bad restaurant. I started eating here years ago. It was fine back then. Then a couple of times the won tons in the noodle soup tasted off. Like it was kept too long but they wouldn't throw it out. So I stopped going for months. Until today. Switched to the beef with noodle soup instead. Bad mistake. When you taste food that has too much salt, they are trying to hide the rancid meat. The beef was salty as a Kardashian tweet war.  And the meat is just as rancid. Please avoid this food poison inducing scam that's not fit for a food license.  And if even one soul avoided eating there because of this review, then you are welcome.  I've saved your soul.
750;Okay, so I had the pad Thai noodles, which were quite dry and stuck together, and the "Thousand Islands" fish.  The fish was disgusting, in a slimy batter with some kind of salad dressing poured on it.  I am not fussy and will normally eat anything but I will not ever be going back to this place.  On top of the awful food, the service was not friendly at all.  It was like they were doing you a favour spooning out that slimy stuff.  Asking for a bit of sauce on the dry noodles got me ignored.  One star is too much for these guys.
751;This place is awful. The food was cold, had no flavour and was super dry. I tried it because it was different from everything else I usually get but I am beyond disappointed. In fact I'm forcing myself to finish it right now just so that I don't feel like I wasted a meal. I wish I was over exaggerating.
752;I normally do not write reviews for food court places but this is worthy of my time in hopes that all readers reading this will avoid eating here wasting your time, money and health.I eat in the food court everyday for work and have had eaten here over 15 times for convenience.  The ladies working here are SO rude, I would sum it up to the rudest people I've met in my life and the food is not good.Example 1)  They ask me how many items and I reply 3, rice, vegetable and beef.  They rudely correct me saying that's 2 and laugh as if I cannot count.  But since when does rice/noodles do not count as an item because it's certainly not free?  She could have just told me that the rice/noodles doesn't count instead of her rude tone.Example 2) The last wonton in my bowl was sour with a spoiled flavor.Example 3)I told the lady I wanted spicy chicken but she grabs me the spicy shrimps so I correct her and she doesn't even apologize and just dumps the shrimps back and then slams my container on the counter har
753;They're getting a two for bad customer service. Usually they would start their '$5.99 End of Day' sale around 8:15 pm, same time as the other places in the food court. Around 8:20pm I saw that they didn't have the sign stating that the sale has begun so I asked one of the employees. Now...  If the sale didn't start or was postponed to a later time,  a logical person would of said "sorry, but we haven't started yet.  Please come back at a later time".  Instead of that, I got a woman shrieking at me "I DON'T KNOW! LATER!" then walked away. Needless to say, I know when my business isn't wanted and I have no problem to comply.  The only reason why I'm even giving it 2 stars is that the food is passable, but there's better places in that food court. Update: went back and got awful service and my meal was 80% rice.  I'd give them half a star if I could.
754;u did me dirty Ruby Thai.  I gave you a second chance two years later and you got me good.  The general tao chicken looks good--everything looks good here...but everything tastes gross.The taste/texture is too controversial. Constantly pulling jiggly bits outta my mouth saying, "oh what's THIS now?" is not my idea of an enjoyable meal. The only seats available at the time were the ones next to the garbage cans. Pause.  Foreshadowing perhaps?I also had a co-worker eat here with me, and she said, "this is just nasty."  This food was garbage long before we held a fork to our plates. The breaded meats are at a 75:25 bread-meat ratio and that's so rude. I have a pic of the remainder bread bits from the general tao chicken and the hard rice. Yeah, HARD rice. HOW do you mess up rice in 2015? Bourbon St grill was right there and I was a fool to ignore them. You did me dirty Ruby Thai. Dirty.  Oh, heads up, the coconut shrimp is DISGUSTING. There's also an abundance of breadedness and the coconut milky paste makes
755;0 stars!!!!DANGER, DANGER WILL ROBINSON, DANGER.I visited here on Saturday, 31 October around 2pm and ordered their noodles and BBQ chicken, as did my friend.By Saturday evening BOTH of us had stomach cramps, and this is the only thing we ate all day besides oatmeal for breakfast.Both of us came down with severe stomach cramps/food poisoning that lasted for DAYS after.  I was having severe cramps 48 hours later!!!Such a painful, horrible experience.  I only started feeling better by Thursday, some 5 or so days later.Friend reported this place to public health.Bad bad place, should be shut down ************They clearly don't know food hygeine, and or don't wash their hands.EAT HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
756;My friend got food from there and found cooked pieces of some plastic wrapper mixed in the food, and a dead bug with weird legs in one of the spring rolls. (I WOULDNT WANNA EAT ROLLS WRAPPED WITH BUGS) The first time it was only the plastic wrapper so they gave my friend the same thing but "new"... Then we found that there was the bug the second time so it wasn't gonna cut it. They gave my friend a refund. Worst customer service as well.. I came and asked for 6 PORK SOUP DUMPLINGS.. and the lady kept telling me to go on the opposite side so I did and then I told a different lady and she told me to go back and this happened like 4 times where I had to walk back and forth cause they didn't friggen understand english. I DONT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.The Szechuan place at urban eatery is way better. Im not saying every time you'll find something in your food but one time is enough. Pay attention to where you eat, and what you eat.Id be careful eating at Ruby Thai. I think public health needs to pay them a v
757;This location is always causing traffic backup, with lines out the parking lot. This is a safety hazard. This location should be moved. It is too popular and it will cause car accidents. Don't say I never advised you store manager.
758;Service is so SLOW and TERRIBLE! Being sick, I had a guilty craving for McDs. I went through the drive through and ordered burger and fries. First window: pulled up to pay, the guy couldn't mutter a single word to me - no etiquette or customer service here. The only "thank you" here was the one that came from my mouth getting my change. Second window: Pulled up to the second window to grab food...and waited...and waited...and waited. I want to say I stood at the window for ten minutes (realistically it was about 7 minutes). No one bothered to come to the window and apologize for the delay or to let me know what was taking so long, despite the fact that an employee was standing right beside the window filling a coffee and spending a lot of time just looking up at a screen.  I guess they'd rather spend ten minutes ignoring the customer than bother acknowledging them or giving them an explanation for the delay - a simple "it'll just be another moment" would've sufficed.At this point there was a long lineu
759;Every time I used the drive through, they asked me to park in  front of the store and wait for the food. In several occasions, it wasn't even busy. To top it all  today we were given the wrong order. Worst location in the GTA.
760;I don't do reviews and I went through the trouble of making this account and writing a review so that I could express how much I was disappointed. This meal was very disappointing. My partner and I ordered the crazy spicy salmon rolls and the crazy spicy butter fish rolls. Some of the rolls didn't have fish in them and they were not spicy. We did not get all of the food we ordered. The service was below average. The mango pudding tastes absolutely terrible. My partner, who eats everything, couldn't bring himself to eat it. We also overheard another customer complain about it. The only thing I enjoyed was the salmon pizza, banana tempura and the vanilla ice cream. I will never come here again. And I would not recommend this place to another person. It's not worth my money.
761;Worst delivery man I have ever met. Short bald guy. My condo has asked him several x not to park in the reserved parking. He insists on parking there even after they spent money and put up signs. He actually took up two spots today and wouldn't move when asked by owner of parking spot..no respect whatsoever. I have not ordered food here and never will
762;Worst sushi I've ever had in my life. Not only was there at least three times more rice (size-wise) than there should normally be for sushi, but the rice is super densely packed that it's almost like mochi. Gross. Have they never had real sushi before? I have to wonder, because I could barely taste the vinegar in the rice either. Super bland rice super bland fish. But the horrible "service" really topped it off. Very rude and even condescending. Oh and they include mandatory tip in their bill, despite not giving any friendly service that would be worth it. I guess they don't have to work for tip so they don't even bother anymore. Don't waste your money or time and go to any of the other multitude of sushi joints in the annex area. I don't even want to give them one star.
763;I don't even know where to begin.....I have probably been to over 30 sushi places but none has been as terrible as Noka.  First of all it took us very long to get seated, the restaurant was almost empty and there were plenty of seats in clear view. Once we got seated, our food didn't come until 45 min and out main courses came before our appetizers. We asked them when out food is coming but they were very rude about it. I'd expect people working as servers to have at least decent customer service. I am never coming back here ever again, I've actually never encounter such a horrid sushi restaurant
764;I was very honoured to have been invited for a tasting meal at NOKA and didn't want to pass up this opportunity for a night of creative presentation, japanese cuisine and any other surprises along the way. On the menu were 8 different dishes showcasing hot and cold, seafood and meat in addition to original dishes, homemade sauces and demonstrations. Watching the chef make their in house salad dressing, I was surprised at the # of ngredients put into it... however, no diary products which was a positive. I must say that the taste of it was very similar to other dressings I've had at other restaurants. Next was the soy sauce taste test. We were offered 3- regular store bought, low sodium soy, and their in house soy. I'm  a fan of low sodium and the verdict  still stands. Their homemade soy sauce was too sour for me, with more vinegar than the norm. This came with the first course - 3 pieces of fatty juicy sashimi - cut beautifully presented in a little wooden box, with a dollop of in house wasabi. Every bite 
765;If there's a half star, that's what i would give this restaurant. I dont normally go to ayce japanese, but its easter sunday and there weren't a lot of places open. O god what a bad choice!!!Service? Girl forgot lots of our order. Ignored us for the 1st half hour til we had to flag her down to give her our order. Then, after reminding her twice that she forgot our miso and spider roll, she still forgot!!! Food? Its ayce...what do u expect?!? But on top of the ayce, we did order spider roll. It was the worst roll ever. I couldnt even describe how disgusting it looked. Just dont come here!!!
766;No sushi for you!My son wanted to go to the restaurant next door for his birthday, but it was closed because they were moving, so we decided to go to Noka. The decor was nice. It was loud, so we had a hard time hearing each other. With 2 teens and a preteen, we ordered a lot of food. The cooked food came out quickly, but then we saw a waitress wandering around carrying around a bowl of edamame. Hey, we had ordered edamame and ours hadn't come yet. The waitress tried to deliver it to a couple of other tables, they didn't want it. I waved at her as she passed by our table, but she didn't even look at us. We never got our edamame. We didn't get most of the sushi or the udon we had ordered either. An hour after we had been seated, someone started to clear our table, including my daughter's medication. After I complained that we were still waiting for our food, they brought out 7 pieces of the sushi we had ordered. After 2 hours of waiting, and still not getting several dishes we had ordered, we asked for the 
767;The service is "worst" in Toronto. I don't wanna go no more. So disappointed. Quality of here is 3/5. However, amount of rice in sushi is more than 1.5 times than another restaurant. I didn't care before waiter warned us. He said if you remain the rice one more, no dishes for next time. What...? They don't know how to say politely. Why don't you guys reduce the rice? They are not deserve to get automatically included 12% tip. It was first time to get angry after eating in Toronto.P.S When you enter the restaurant, you may wait 5 min even there is only 2 teams in. Waiter is missing.  And watch out, server doesn't like question and lunch last call is not 4:30, "real time" is 4. .
768;Before I get into my review, I'd like to say I order sushi on a regular basis and have never been compelled to write a review until now (as I'm lazy, and pretty easygoing about food).Sushi places with a similar price point, to be clear. That being said - DO NOT GO HERE.Delivery:The ordering process for my small order took a very, very long time. Despite speaking in a slow and clear manner, I had to repeat myself multiple times to multiple people. I get that it happens, but it took over ten minutes to order 2 specials with zero substitutions. I felt that was far too long for such a small order.Ding Dong (except not really because I don't have a doorbell but ok):Items arrived 45min later. Delivery person didn't say anything to me, just held a white bag with food. I asked for the receipt and he didn't 'do' anything.. like respond, make eye contact, make a noise, anything.. So I tore my receipt off myself. Tipped him, I don't know why. On the phone they asked me twice about tipping the driver though. Messag
769;This was the worst restaurant experience of my life. My sister and I had gone in and we were given extremely rude service from the beginning. We proceeded to order food and after the first round the server a female very rudely informed us that we would be charged for left over rice that my sister had taken off the sushi because it was too thick. We are glad to adhere by the rules of AYCE but the manner in which we were told was humiliating and degrading to say the least. After asking to speak to the manager a group of males approached us from the back room when one of the proceeded to physically threaten my sister. He came close to her as if he was going to hurt her. I quickly asked for the bill and left before the situation escalated into something worse. I have never been treated like this and I am shocked that this kind of thing happens at this place. If you want to save yourself the humiliation please avoid this place! They are rude and don't know how to operate a customer orientated business.
770;I placed an order for delivery through Orderit.ca. my order was:1 The Bomb Roll add soup and salad2 5 Pcs. Sushi 1 9 Pcs. Sashimi 1 Shrimp and Veggie Tempura Dinner Combo Delivery took an hour and 20 minutes. The tempura was soft, and had a floury taste. The fish used in the sushi and sashimi tasted old, and fishy. We ended up throwing most of it out. I'll never risk ordering from here again.
771;The food is nice, the service is so-sothe only shit i can't stand is they add 12% tip in advance every timealthough i always tip around 12-15%, but still don't think service fee should be mandatory
772;Everything in the business owner reply is completely made up by the owner.  Nothing in his reply actually happened.  I will never go to Noka because I don't respect lying business owners.
773;I feel as if it is my civil duty to warn everyone about their customer service. On my second trip to this restaurant, my table was yelled at by a waiter who did not even serve us. This happened after we ate our dessert and I asked for the bill. This staff member literally started yelling about wasting food and ordering too much. First of all, it was half a plate of (overcooked) chicken katsu, 2 pieces of spicy fried chicken, 3 pieces of sushi (half a roll), and a spring roll, so it wasn't as if we left an absurd amount of food. I hate food waste and this obviously was not intentional. If he had felt so strongly about food waste, he could have asked us to bring the leftovers home or HE SHOULD NOT WORK IN AN AYCE BUSINESS. We weren't even refusing to pay an extra charge or anything. He honestly suddenly came up to our table to yell at us. I felt as if I was being scolded by a parent and it took everything in me not to say "Yes, dad" so I settled for "Yes, sir" in a rather sarcastic tone. He ranted incessantly a
774;Buyer beware:  you may or may not receive your order and will not get a refund.  I ordered $50.00 worth of sushi from this restaurant the other day and when it did not arrive, the restaurant refused to issue a refund and deferred me to "just eat" to deal with the problem. They insisted it had arrived and would not help rectify the problem.  "Just eat" could not get them to refund the money and I was left having spent $50.00 and wasting over and hour of my time.  There are plenty of sushi places in Toronto that have excellent customer service.  Don't waste your money here.
775;Absolutely the worst. Went in on a Sunday just to try out different restaurants on Bloor as I'm new to the area. Me and my dad have gone to hundreds of AYCE Japanese places and this is no doubt the worst. We came in at 8pm, left at 10pm and we only ordered 1 sheet of paper because instead of focusing on the patrons in the restaurant they were too preoccupied with their deliveries. So as we waited 15-20 minutes for each dish, we watched as a delivery guy would run out of the restaurants holding 10 bags of food. Similarly everyone else at the restaurant was complaining at the service. Finally to top it off after the worst service of them constantly apologizing that they lost our order or saying "its on its way".. they had the nerve to charge us for gratuity as per their policy! Insane to think people actually go there considering they're directly beside the best sushi resto on bloor...Sushi on Bloor.
776;This place used to be my favourite sushi place until the other day when I went for lunch with my boyfriend and a friend.They removed a lot of items from their AYCE menu.  I like going for AYCE at Noka because they had a variety of choices but their menu is a lot smaller now. The service was crap.  The waitress only had 2 tables (ours and another table of 2). She gave us a table for 2 but didn't bring us extra plates, chopsticks, napkins for the third person. I had to ask! I had to ask for water refills. We didn't get wasabi and pickled ginger.   We had to ask for that too.  We had to ask for things that should've automatically been done.  Our plates were piling up and took her forever to come around to pick it up because she was chit chatting instead of working and would stop by our table every 5+ mins. They had an ok vegetarian option. Would like to see a few more on there.We were so disappointed in the service, we didn't tip her well.  What disappointed us the most was the service would've been good
777;I went here on a first date back in early December, 2013. Bad idea.There was no wasabi or ginger served to us, the fish had an off taste, too much rice on the sushi, and the beef did not have the texture of beef. Made me question whether it was cat, dog, or even human. I've never had that texture of meat in my mouth before. So creepy.Needless to say, neither him nor I returned to this "restaurant".We both left with upset stomachs, but at least we had a bonding experience. How romantic.
778;My first clue that walking into this place was a mistake, is that Chinese are running this place!  Exit !..... Fast!  Last thing I need is kidney failure!
779;This is the worst ayce sushi in toronto. Its a rip off! The bald guy waiter is unfriendly and on the rush to give our bill and dont even bother to fill our cups with water. Food is not good if you want a decent ayce sushi buffet go to sakura garden in avenue road. I rate this place -5
780;I came one night past 10pm. Sushi on Bloor was closed so I decided to try this establishment out. What a mistake! I order Salmon Lover ($9 before tax) and the quantity was so little. It is definitely the smallest roll I have ever had at any sushi restaurant. It probably weighed little more than 100g. The taste is just no different from any other place but you get so little bang for your buck. Do not come here, you are better off somewhere else.
781;Sushi was decent, although I did second guess the quality of the Yellowtail. The service was horrible. Our waiter essentially tossed the plates and wasabi bowls on the table and took off while I was in the middle of asking him a question. Our mains came before our appetizers and after a half hour we had to ask where our appies were a 3rd time. Such a frustrating dining experience.~ In response to the owner's question, I do not recall the server's name. It was late afternoon September 1st, 2014 and the server was male and fairly tall.
782;I never write reviews but people need to know NOT to come here... Really hungry so walked in without looking at reviews and that's absolutely my bad... not that I was expecting good quality sushi but even for AYCE standard this was horrendous.  Soooooooooo much rice in the sushi and rolls.  Salmon was super cheap salmon (obviously not sushi graded).  Mackerel was really really fishy.  Automatic 12% service fee for bad service.  :)
783;OMG. Where do I even start with this place? There were so many things wrong with my dinner tonight. I am actually writing this review while still in the restaurant just so I don't forget the numerous culinary horrors that I have succumbed to. Well that...and I am doing this to actually avoid eating more food in hopes that my boyfriend would eventually make rest of the food disappear. OK....enough romance, here are the problems:1. Misleading menu descriptions: I ordered some chicken fried rice because I love the buttery taste of hibachi style fried rice and the menu promised that it was going to be a small bowl.  What arrived was a mountaneous plate of MSG fried rice.  It was like booking Kate Moss for a fashion show and getting Rosie O'Donnell.2. Sashimi was warm and poorly cut.  There was actually a small piece bone that was still attached to the salmon belly (which is "salmon toro" on the menu - something like this is really insulting to customers' intelligence). 3.  All grill items were overcooked an
784;I think these guys are going broke. As someone with celiac disease, I would go here for their gluten-free soy sauce. Today they told me that it would cost an extra dollar for both my friend and I to have this "special" sauce. I can buy a whole bottle for $4. I spoke to the manager and she said, "Well, if you don't want to pay for it then you can just use the regular soy sauce." -- right -- because that works for someone with a severe allergy. Then they delivered one bowl with wasabi and ginger...so I'm guessing money's tight? I wonder if they're cutting corners in other ways...won't be going back here. There are a million better sushi places -- I'll just bring my own packages of gluten free soy sauce!Bye bye Noka!
785;Ugh, I don't understand why some people do service based jobs when they clearly don't care. We have been ordering from here since it opened and it was generally ok in terms of consistency. But tonight we had an experience so poorly handled that we are taking our business elsewhere.We put in our usual order via Just Eat, as we never have had an issue with them. But after 90 minutes our meal still hadn't shown up, and when we got ahold of the manager - we called twice - he was so completely indifferent (despite aknowledging that we are regulars) that we ended up refusing the order (I had already started cooking something out of desperation). He didn't apologize, but tried to blame the driver and placate us with a free order of the cheapest appetizer they have. It was downright insulting. And short sighted, considering the number of sushi joints in the city.So, bottom line: avoid like a Nickelback tour. It's in your best interest.
786;We went here because everything else was closed at 11:45am. The cooked items were ok. The agedashi tofu and karaage is just normal fried tofu and chicken. Super limited options on their lunch menu- ex. They didn't have shrimp tempura which is pretty standard. Owner was talking on the phone loudly in an unpleasant way the whole time and the waitress wasn't very responsive. They make the maki and nigiri gigantic with way too much rice so that you get full faster. Normally at another AYCE sushi place we could order a lot but here we only did one small round because the pieces were so ridiculously big. We had to take out over 50% of the rice but they wouldn't give us more sushi unless we ate it all which was impossible. Just paid and left- won't be going back.
787;Don't go here!I've gone here several times over the past two years and this will be my last visit. They raised the lunch AYCE from $11.99 to $12.99 which wasn't a big deal but they also started charging $2.00 for their sashimi during lunch which use to be included with the base price. We decided to not have the The rice and salmon ratio on their sushi was absolutely pathetic. My friend and I had to cut a third of the rice off in order to even have any taste of the salmon.When asking for the bill, they tried to charged us $2.00+ each for leaving some of the rice behind because we "only ate the salmon" bits. When explaining to the server that we only took off a bit of the rice so that the sushi would even be edible, he had the audacity to question how my mother raised me which was definitely not necessary.The server then offered to void the charge if we eat whatever was left. I don't know what happened to this place but their sushi is a mess and the servers only care about trying to cheap you out and 
788;I never do reviews... I made this account just to say their food at this restaurant is EXTREMELY disappointing. Not only is this place dingy looking but their customer service is poor!! I ordered a chicken tempera, spicy salmon roll, salmon hand roll and a shrimp tempera roll. The chicken tempera tasted under-seasoned, the spicy salmon was messy, the seaweed of the hand roll tasted stale with way too much rice and the shrimp tempera roll was absolutely sad. Also.. When I informed the waitress (Anna) that I didn't enjoy the food she bragged and said "well.. we are very popular". How unprofessional is that?.. Not even an apology! DO NOT go there.. There's other sushi restaurants around!
789;Noka sushi on Bloor is the worst sushi I've ever had in my life excepting sushi purchased from a drug store. Rubbery, slimy, grainy sashimi, some of it still had ice on it. Gummy, stale rice, even the seaweed salad tasted wrong somehow, not a single dish was good except the miso. It was a challenged to eat not because we were full but because it was all just awful. The only edible food was just deep fried and bland but at least it wasn't screaming "possible food poisoning" at me like their fish selection and it certainly wasn't worth the $85 they charged us for 2 adults and a 4 year old had 2 pieces of tempura, a few bites of chicken teriyaki and a scoop of ice cream which they charged us almost $15 for. They added a 12% tip to the meal on top of prompting us to tip again when paying. Service was more or less ok but the food was awful and it was almost $90 for 2 people (plus one domestic beer at $7.50 and a 4 year old who literally had 4 bites of food). As if all this wasn't enough we witnesses a fellow diner
790;I haven't eaten on this strip of Bloor in years and was completely taken by surprise by the number of Japanese restaurants.  It turned out to be a coin toss as to which one we chose and with hunger having a good grip on us we chose Noka since it had seats available.  Now I know why.Aside from getting prompt service when taking our order I had to flag down servers for anything else.  The roll we ordered (Noka Spicy Salmon) was a mushed up salmon mix piped on top of a lackluster roll of rice, pollack (the fake crab) cucumber and I can't remember what else.  Way too much rice in the roll for my liking, and not much for flavour at all, even when eating only the "spicy" salmon topping.  It was hard to tell if the salmon was fresh, though I'd bet it was old, hence making it a mixture.The fish slices on the sushi were dwarfed by the massive rice boat it sat upon.  I was not partaking in the All You Can Eat menu so was perplexed as to why they'd still serve it this way.  I ended up slicing half of the rice off, a
791;Went here on a whim with my boyfriend when we were both craving sushi. The experience was so terrible that I don't even know where to begin with this review...1. Terrible service. After being seated (the server simply pointed to our seat without even a greeting) we were neglected for most of our meal. Service was extremely slow and they even forgot to bring out some items we ordered. They also neglected to refill our water, take additional food orders, or bring out the bills when we had finished.2. Quality of the food was the worst I've ever had. The pork gyoza and spring rolls were very greasy (all you could taste was grease, nothing else). Taking a bite of the grilled eggplant was like eating oily mush. The sushi and maki rolls were warm and mushy. It definitely was not fresh. The avocado they used looked like it was going rotten. (Also note: there is a warning on the menu that some food items may not be fully cooked and could lead to illness. If that doesn't ruin your appetite then I don't know what will
792;Avoid this place at all cost unless you don't mind paying the 12% mandatory gratuity!Boyfriend and I were being adventurous, instead of going to our usual AYCE sushi joint, we went to try something new, came home completely disappointed and furious.I would give 3 stars for their food quality despite the sushi rice was a bit sour than other sushi places. Shame, I liked how fresh their salmon sashimis were. The restaurant gives out a weird vibe, we felt pressured enjoying our food there, it felt like you were constantly being watched and judged because the waitresses were so worried if you are going to waste the food. At a point, they refused to serve us food we ordered because they think we will not be able to finish, hmm excuse me? They did not check back often to refill waters, you can hear someone kept shouting at the kitchen as well. Horrible service.We ignored the fact with them judging our appetite but what made me mad was the 12% mandatory gratuity! We ended up spending $70+ for 2 person AYCE, ima
793;No surprise that they have 2 stars. Just walked out after they refused to serve our table because not everyone was planning on getting the all you can eat option. They were also very rude about the situation. We've been to many other sushi restaurants that have all you can eat and normally my son and I get it and my wife and daughter get something off the menu because they are not big eaters. If you like rude service and only having one option of all you can eat then this is the place for you.
794;I give it 3 stars because of my friend who loves this place. I would have rated this 1 star like many others. The food is not bad, but the service has improved, from horrible to acceptable. Therefore I generally say: 3 stars A-OK. The service was ridiculously bad, borderline insulting, when I went a few months ago. Bad service destroys my appetite. So I vowed not to go again. But my friend doesn't give a damn. He can still enjoy the okay food under any circumstance. Anyway, I joined this friend again recently because I still like sushi. Surprisingly, the service actually wasn't that bad this time. They didn't screw up the order much, didn't threaten us to be careful how much we order, and didn't treat us like crap. Huge improvement, but still it's pretty obvious the manager doesn't care about service. If he/she did, then I think this place can reach 4 stars easily.----Update: Went there this week. Editing rating to 1 star. Yea, there's still that tall asian dude working there that treats you like dirt.
795;We ate here at lunch time, even though there are lots of other sushi places we thought we'd try it because of it's variety.   Worst time ever !!!They didn't finish our order, I had to request/ remind them for our food. The rolls were thick ie. Too much rice. Our neighbour was pychotic, I don't have anything against real pychosis, but it makes for an interesting lunch.
796;This place is dismally bad. I thought I had the worst sushi in my life when I was in Prince Albert (in northern Saskatchewan) at Sushi House. Noka may have surpassed sushi house in poor quality. While I liked the idea of pumpkin sushi, Noka's version of 'sushi pizza' is probably the worst thing I've ever made the unfortunate mistake of putting in my mouth (I was hooked in by the idea of it including seaweed salad...). The salmon was horrible, incredibly fatty and just generally poor qualityIn short, you probably shouldn't eat here
797;We ordered about 100$ worth of sushi from this place. The tuna tasted like it had gone bad and was minced to cover the taste. Called the restaurant to let them know and they couldn't of cared less. Never ordering from here again and you shouldn't either.
798;Went a couple days ago with friends and was severely disappointed. Food was mediocre and in many cases we had doubts about its freshness. However the worst part was the service. Our waitress just dropped food in front of us and was extremely rude. When we came in we immediately asked if it was alright if there was someone in our party who wasn't eating and we were told it was. When the time came to pay they charged him $15 and all he had was a glass of water. Overall I will not be coming back and I do not recommend unless they get new staff.
799;What a disaster.i had eaten at Noka before and remembered it being pricier than other spots on Bloor and of equal quality. passing by this weekend and seeing a "$12.99 AYCE" sign, my dining companion and I figured the deal was too good to pass up.we headed in and waited ten minutes for a table. no big deal!once seated we promptly filled out our ayce menus. and waited. Finally i waved a server down and gave her our menu. after 15 minutes, not even our miso soup had arrived.DISCLAIMER - i'm not an unreasonable person. for a $13 ALL you can eat experience, you tend to expect rough-around-the-edges service (which is too bad. all businesses should care about their customers, even when they're offering a deal. but in toronto, i just don't expect a good deal and good service to overlap) time passed....every time it looked like food was coming to us, it came to the table(s) surrounding us. THEN, food started coming in high volume to the table next to us, that had arrived about 10 minutes AFTER us.still no s
800;The sushi is ok, the service is less then desirable. Ordered take out twice from them First time I ordered it took an hour to receive my food. The second  time I ordered it took two hours. I called and they said it was very busy. Ok I understand, but if your running that behind pick up the phone and call your customer to let them know it's running late. Won't ordered from here again. Lots of sushi places in Toronto to choose from. This place has lost my business.
801;Not very good. Over priced for the quality and portion size- especially compared to what is available in the area. Not the greatest service and they know it: an automatic 12.5% gratuity is added
802;The music was blasting way too loud. In the upstairs lounge-ish area, the music was loud to the point of being extremely uncomfortable. How does one lounge in this place? The downstairs dance area was even worse. It looked like a concrete hideout/cave with outdated and wimpy laser-type rays of light pulsating to illuminate a small gathering of dancers who seemed like they were on something. May I have my hearing back?
803;Place is nice and has a great ambiance.  I love the Thursday night band, Jumple and went to see them play one of their regular sets.  Crowd was great and the music rocked.Why the 1 star review?  $2 for a highball glass of water with more ice than water.  They charged this despite the fact that I had paid for other things at the bar and my friends had spent a fair bit on drinks as well.As much as I love the band and as much as I would love to make this a regular spot to hang out, I can't go back to Lily lounge for this reason alone.
804;Absolute unpleasant and rude experience! Attempted to visit this neighbourhood restaurant with a Buytopia deal for 3 course meal. The deal was stated for Thursday - Saturday only, and since I am only available to get out on Thursday nights due to my household schedule, I thought this would be perfect! Since they only open at 7pm, I left a message with my reservation. I eventually got connected to a woman staff member who told me that they do not work on Thursdays and that I can only come on Friday or Saturday. Upon inquiring about the Buytopia fine print, she turned very rude and instead of kindly explaining the situation to me, she rudely told me that it's not her problem that I can't come on Friday or Saturday.  Although the fine print may have been a mistake on Buytopia's part (I don't know), they staff person was extremely impolite, refused to provide me her name so that I can at least try claim back the near $80 paid for this no cash-back or credit-back voucher.Although I never had the chance to step
805;hello everyoneok so i eat out a lot and go too many different places. i was here saturday night and i must say thissssssss place by far is a ok restaurantnotnotnotnot!!!!this place was the worst place i have ever been too. the good was horriable . the waiters were not bad but the management was the worse. this place looks like its a cover up for some shady stuff. the owner was very very rude and disrespectfull which made me feel like he dosent care about what the restarunt reviews are but more whats going on the backround!!i suggest everyone to run run away from this place!!!
806;Went there Sunday 1am for dancing (bar hopping).  The place was not busy at all.  The staff was not pleasant.  They charge cover charges. The place was dirty. Floor was sticky. Young small crowd. The music wasn't to my liking.  The only thing I liked was that the dj enjoyed himself a lot. Very happy and into the music.  We left after one drink.
807;I was extremely disappointed here, they had booked other djs at a private party, on top of the dj that was scheduled to be there months ahead of time. The managers made no apology and often dissapeared instead of dealing with the problem. If there is one place I would never step foot in again its Lily Lounge.
808;Ughhhh... so... Li'ly...This place is bad. I held a group event at Li'ly, party of 20. Called in 2 weeks in advance and asked about the menu, space, and pricing. Everything sounded good and they claimed to have served larger groups before, so this was a good sign.Ohhh boy, it was much below anyone's expectation.To start, we were the only ones at the restaurant. The space was fine, big  enough to accommodate larger groups and some dancing after wards. The bar was long and the bartender/wait staff were friendly.Drinks were expensive, 7 for domestic beers and more for import. The menu looked fine in print, but extremely disappointing when presented before our eyes. Although we made this reservation weeks ahead, they didn't seem capable of handling our orders. The appetizers arrived 45 minutes after ordering. I remember this because I had time to walk over to The Spotted Pig (a restaurant a block east on college) for a few drinks before returning, just to wait an additional 7 minutes for the food to appear
809;If I could put zero stars I would this guy is a scam artist he goes around ripping off anybody he can . he goes under several different names his convertible tops are so cheap it's unbelievable and they don't fit . beware don't be fooled by the warranty because there is none how he is getting away with this I don't have a clue but I guarantee I'm calling the Better Business Bureau consumer protection! I'm sure they know who he is! People like this ought to be ashamed of their self  taking people's money and selling junk I just wish I would've read some of these before I bought off of this company! Big scammer!!  And the bad part about it he don't care!! No conscience whatsoever! I just hope he gets what's coming to him one day and I'm sure he well
810;Bought mustang convertible top June 1, 2015. Now by November 19, 2015, top is beginning to tear and is showing wear from window rubbing. AutoBerry will not stand behind their 6 year warranty. They claim to use Haartz sail cloth, but the fabric seems cheap and thin compared to the original top that lasted 10 years and was still good except for the rear window glue failing. After three calls and nearly ten emails I have given up knowing that I have been ripped off by a purveyor of junk. My mistake paying attention to the 6 year warranty advertisement. Look for a higher quality product.
811;I received the boot I ordered quickly. Was very excited to put it on. However, when I went to do this something wasn't right. I informed Autoberry right away that I had received the wrong year. I own 1983 Fiat this boot would fit my old Fiat that was 1974. They would not even consider that I was correct. Just kept saying that it was 100% correct and I didn't know what I was doing. They never offered any assistance telling me this product didn't come with instructions. The only thing they offered was that they would take care of it if I took it to an upholsterer and they agreed it was wrong. So I did take it and they did agree it was wrong. Still Autoberry insisted it was correct. The 1983 not only has different hardware on the car but it is in a different spot. Their is no way for this to work. They did refund my money but not the return shipping. I felt they should pay it being that they sent me the wrong product.
812;Used to be really good. But now toppings are rarely used and it's too much bread. Barely a pizza
813;Can I give this place a minus star rating. Please heed my warnings. The pizzas weren't good at this location. Not all Ginos are bad.
814;WOW. Worst pizza experience ever. We will never order from this location again. Poor quality food. Poor service. and language barrier. We are very disappointed.
815;This was the worst pizza I have ever had! Purchased a Chicken Club slice and it was dry and tasteless. I was better off going hungry.
816;This is a terrible restaurant.  After having been a few times, thinking that it may have been just a bad day to be there, I now know that this is their standard of performance.  Staff have no idea why they're there.  Food is warmish at best and seems to be left over and sitting there for hours.  They constantly have menu items that are not available due to "running out".  There are food chunks in the heavily watered down gravy.  The chicken is floppy and definitely not freshly made.  And yet it takes FOREVER to get the order and is always missing items.  How does one miss putting fries in a meal combo?  Save your money.  The Colonel would be disgusted.
817;The costumer service here is awful. Last time we ordered delivery.. they messed up on the "hot and spicy" (ordered 8, got 6 in "original" style). No napkins were included, same goes for the hot sauce. It's like no one bothers to pay attention when finishing the order. Oh and they fuc*ed up on the special instructions too. Specifically asked to "Call first, come to side door", which was completely ignored as the delivery guy disturbed the cranky physically-impaired lady upstairs. Why am I paying $5 for delivery when they don't even bother to do it right or even READ?! There's places that do delivery for free and gets it right. Not a dime will be spent on food from this place again.
818;Terrible customer service. Didn't send items on two occasions. Last time I'll order from these incompetent people. KFC, you're going way down in service. Keep it up and you'll be out of business at this location before you know it.
819;I have been to this KFC 3 times now because my husband takes me there and I have just had it.  It is just so disgusting there.  I told my husband to never take me there EVER again.  The chicken is always lukewarm - not fresh at all.  And every time I tell the cashier to make sure it's fresh and they just ignore you.  And it always feels dirty inside.  And there washroom was absolutely gross - piss on the floor.  Very dirty.  Gross.  They can't even make the place respectable for their customers.  Huge thumbs down!!!!
820;The fact that this franchise keeps popping up all over the place is a testament to the fact that people have no freaking clue.How desperate are you for Thai food that you have to suffer through the  globulous mess that is their Pad Thai? What is that brown sauce they put on it? It tastes like warm, brown dessert syrup.The curries are not much better.The Tom Yum Soup is marginally do-able if you put enough lime and chili oil in it, but it's not winning any awards.Just say 'NO'.
821;I'm usually fair when it comes to reviewing spots but in this case I just can't be. The older asian guy that was cooking the food was constantly coughing into the food!Will never ever return and gonna report him to the head office. Sadly I can't leave 0 stars. Disgusting don't come here!
822;I'd be cautious about eating here if you're at all concerned with sanitation and health codes. While the place itself is new and in a beautiful building, the employees were clearly not following any form of sanitary procedure. I asked for tap water and they said they were all out. I asked how they washed their hands, and they said they didn't and laughed. I also saw them playing with their phones and then putting food back in the pot with their hands. Disgusting.  I ended up leaving.
823;My friend ordered a spicy tofu pad thai and it ended up being way to spicy like burn your lips off spice. The tofu is also different at this location which begs the question are they even using the supplier that is required of them? The workers are a little intimidating here, they could use some customer service training. Restaurant was also dirty. My friend instantly regretted not getting hotstar instead.
824;Worst Thai express ever. The workers were too busy socializing with the other employees to notice people in line. Also the food was terrible. The meal was so over cooked. Ended up throwing it away. To add to that all, the place also was very dirty. Will never be back to this location. Take the walk to the location at the urban eatery if you want good Thai express.
825;tldr: Don't go here.You may think that you know how blah Thai Express usually is, but this particular location is worse than usual.The staff makes sure you know that they are completely indifferent to you. When they mess up your order it should come as no surprise.  Food is mediocre quality and is very pricey for a fast-food place.  There are many Thai places around here that are better in every way, for a comparable price or less.The only good thing that can be said about this place is that you will get your food fast because nobody is ever in there.
826;I'm reviewing the Villa Madina half of this restaurant.  Shame on Yelp for not distinguishing the two for the search process.  Because of this, it looks like I'm giving Thai Express a bad review. Half an hour before class (again) and I needed something to feed my belly close to campus.  Last time, I went into this restaurant and walked right back out because I realized I had eaten Thai Express for the last 3 weeks and could not get enough of it, but didn't really pay much attention to Madina. So this time I thought I'd give them a whirl.  Since I like Mediterranean food, it took me a while to decide what plate to try out.  I went for the oddest one I could see, which was the Sujuk plate.  Sounds weird right?It's basically a mix of your choice of rice, salad, potato wedges and some all-beef sausages with some garlic and hummus.  Mmmm this makes me hungry just typing it.  Anyway the lady behind the counter seems to be in a rush and I caught a hint of a mild language barrier between us, but what can I sa
827;Ehh, go somewhere else. Thai express is bland and not what I would call Thai food. The chicken in my Tom Yum was hard and obviously previously frozen. The soup flavors were disjointed, nothing blended well with the other ingredients. The shared seating space is dirty and not well maintained.
828;pretty terriblePad thai is just noodles and some meat, and tiny flecks of green onionWrong kind of noodles, no peanuts, fish sauce, lime, peanuts, tamarindsweet thai-ish sauce gives it a reddish colourbut you're better off getting a burger or shawarma here than Thai
829;This was truly the worst food I've ever eaten in Toronto.  I got veggie korma, ate about three bites, and threw it out.  It was inedible sludge.  This restaurant actually has newspaper clippings of positive reviews in their window.  How is that possible?
830;The worst halwa poori Nashta ever, she cooks fries and poori and every thing else in the same oil.
831;The food here is something you should have on a last resort. The burger is just mediocre. A frozen Zabiha Halal beef patty that's been doused in ketchup and lettuce is not my idea of a burger. The fries are never seasoned with salt so they're not worth it. I had their Philly cheesesteak once. It was literally a hot dog bun with a few thin strips of steak and some low grade mozzarella cheese. Second grill made my first philly cheesesteak experience a horrible one.The menu is too large for them to handle, no clue why they expanded it in the first place. Stick to burgers and fries, develop a decent product and then consider adding relevant items on the menu.
832;Ordered Halwa Puri. I was specific before placing my order **DO YOU MAKE HALWA PURI OR IS IT STORE BOUGHT** The guy on the phone tells me " we make it and freeze it to preserve". Not being able to comprehend this madness I asked to speak to someone else. The lady also get's on the phone and tell me that puri's are NOT store bought and are made fresh here.  I drive up there to pick up my order. Not only I can clearly see that these puri's sandwiched between table napkins are store bought but there happens to be the transparent translucent plastic paper that divides the store bought poori's sitting next to where she was making my puri's. I am like really? You still want to stick to that story?. I than again got BS that somehow they go through a methodical effort to make their fresh home made puri's to look like $1.99 pack of store bought ones. I figured these guys are a bunch of liars and this will be last time buying anything here. I gave the guy 2x $5 bills. Right then I realized I have change in my car and I
833;Never again. Very unfriendly. The food is bad just plain greasy. They keep their cooking spatulas next to the garbage can
834;had high hopes trying this new McDonald's location. Supposed to have new high-tech ordering features, but was I disappointed. Starting from the counter where you order we waited 7 minutes for someone to realize there were four people in line waiting to take order. Then we couldn't find a table that wasn't sticky or dirty or have napkins and other peoples garbage on it. When we do sit down and begin eating we hear the overhead music that's playing in the restaurant is some type of ghetto rap, with lyrics that say sitting alone at home on the bathroom floor hungry have to have sex with a man for a little bit of money! Somehow I don't think that is a Ronald McDonald theme song, just my thought as for the food hamburgers had very little amount of condiments hardly any ketchup onions they were almost there, the Italian tasty that they were selling the chicken was dry and dark and hard I would not order it again
835;McDonald inside Walmart extremely dirty. From drinks to serviette area has trash over flow. Ketchup all over the counter. NONE of the table at seating area is clean. The only good thing about this location is no line up.
836;Terrible. BEWARE the coat check! I was only there for an hour and they gave my jacket to someone else who described it. The food and drinks was overpriced based on the service and the ownership was particularly surly. Not worth the time, not worth the money. Plenty of better locales in that area.
837;NEVER AGAIN....I went here a few weeks back with friends who know the owners and kind of call this place their's....now I have a wonderful time with my friends and was even treaded to my meal, but if I had to pay I would have screamed.The only thing that was good was the wine...and they didn't make it (eek!)Each item is a-la-cart and the sides are served up family style almost.  I had the Shrimp with chorizo  on a polenta bed.  I had the massed potatoes as the side because the waitress talked me into them....cause they were SOOOO good.....not in my books.....the whole meal was lacking in taste and substance for the price.  The potatoes tasted like a box, the chorizo was chewy and over cooked and the polenta was hard to cut....I thought polenta was to be creamy.  My friend steak was cooked from frozen and tough to eat.  He also ordered it with no onions, but it came with no mushrooms.For after dinner my buddies ordered Espresso...I'm not a fan, so I just watched as they went through 2 rounds of sending
838;Church Street is definitely NOT the place for fine dining, and Voglie is no exception. Food is disgusting. Coffee is disgusting. Don't go here for lunch, dinner or anything.The only time it's somewhat ok to go here is late night on a Friday or Saturday when there's music. Usually the music is decent but it's not great. Drink prices are nicer priced than the neighbouring lezzy bar Slack's.The only time I go here is if my friends insist on going here and I have nothing better to do... which is rarely the case.Daytime service is absent and sometimes rude, especially during Pride when they're automatically guaranteed the business so they don't feel like they have to be efficient or nice. Serving the two gay men that came in after me BEFORE they served me seemed a bit odd since I was in a lesbian bar (and I guess kind of expected my female privilege to come into effect).Sometimes it smells like vomit (but only if you're lucky).
839;It's just a disaster, my shawarma sawich was destroyed, it messed up every where and now i am hungry. Do not waste your money!
840;I had the worst chicken shwarma of my life here. It was so skinny/tiny and flavourless. Hardly any toppings inside. I couldn't believe it compared to the shwarmas I've had everywhere else in the city. After reading the reviews I'm glad to know I'm not the only one.Wish I'd seen the post below about a past insect infestation. Disgusting. I'll never go here again.
841;I feel extremely ripped off.  I paid for a 2 kaftas combo (#6), paid $10.50 and took it to go back to the office after a dentist appointment at Yonge/Eglinton.  I get back to the office (Yonge/Finch) to have my lunch only to find that the 2 kaftas are missing.  WTF!!!Then I find their phone number (416.544.1212) on the website and it's not in service.  WTF!!!I sent their head office a complaint.  Let's see if they reply.Too bad Yelp doesn't allow zero stars.
842;This place is a travesty of a shawarma/falafel place. Even at lunch, the food tastes stale and old. Servings are small and the food is overpriced and bland. It's a real shame, the location at the Eaton Centre is actually pretty decent as far as mall food court Middle Eastern is concerned. At the Eaton Centre, the food tastes fresh and the supply of salads is plentiful. The Yonge/Eg folks could learn a thing or two by taking a subway ride down to Y/D.I'm not expecting a lot from a place in the Riocan Centre food court -- but some semblance of quality would be good for the price.
843;Getting a salad is the same price as elsewhere but you can only get 2 toppings -- whereas most other places you get 4-6. 2 vegetables on a plate is not a meal or filling. The tabbouli had very little flavor too -- more like just parsley then the refreshing, lemony dish you normally get. Overpriced for the quality of food you get. There are much better options right near by.
844;After my disappointment with Villa Mandina I tried Kabul Kabob and Shawarma located at street level (30 Eglinton W.) a couple of days later and discovered my destination for Shwarma!  Their food portions are huge, price is reasonable and service is professional.  With a place like Kabul Kabob and Shawarma just next door why would anyone go to Valla Mandina?
845;Warning warning warning: This place was CLOSED (Red Card) By the City of Toronto July 9 for an insect infestation, then tried to hide the notice!Avoid.
846;I ordered the falafel pita for lunch and was sooo disappointed with it.  I use to go here all the time as I work in the area, but I think I am going to give up on it.  The falafel was cold, they skimped on all the toppings.  They must be trying to cut costs, but its not working for them.
847;Worst Subway I've ever been to in my life. Got food poisoning from a 6" "chicken" sub. Missed 2 days of work and was violently sick for nearly 36 hours straight. Contacted the owner and he took zero responsibility but offered me a free meal on him! SPEECHLESS. Subway corporate didn't even bother to address my concern. I'm done with Subway for eternity. If you're still a Subway fan, good luck, but my advice is AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COSTS.
848;Thee was only two parking slot, that is Okay.Seems it is family business there, the young guys(son) was really rude. The father wasn't clean, he didn't change plastic gloves for each of customers ...
849;Don't recommend this place, the lady offered a promotion that if buying a chicken shawarma plate , it will come with any free drink. I saw a bottle of green tea I wanted therefore I got it. When paying, the cashier said it only applies to CAN drinks, and bottles were upgrade of $1 more. Very misleadingThe chicken was dry and the potato was old and sandyPlease see pictures.
850;I usually go into this location for a quick meal on my way to work for later. I always get the chicken shawarma plate because I want veges and the garlic potatoes. The food is alright for what it is. There are better places but it is close to where I live.Today I ordered my meal in line after a woman who asked for a chicken plate. I said I would also like a chicken plate and was told to wait 5 minutes. I figured the wait was for the rice so I stepped to the side. I looked at my watch and realized I didn't have time to wait before I had to be at work. I told the owner I was going to leave because I didn't have time and to cancel my order. Turns out the lady before me ordered souvlaki chicken instead of the shawarma I thought she ordered. The man had already put the meat on the grill. I said I was sorry for making the mistake and that I didn't realize she ordered something else. The man (who I assume is the owner) became quite angry and aggressive with me, angrily telling me that he already put the food on 
851;Shite, 12 bucks for a salad with some dried up shawarma meat..no thanks
852;Poor value for money! $14 for a shawarma plate? Ridiculous!Many other options in the area where you get much better food for less. Don't bother!
853;It was awful but I ate it all because I was starving and is the only reason why I finished my chicken shawarma with extra disgusting "garlic sauce" that tasted like oregano. It was such a let-down and did not deliver the taste of garlic which is the true hallmark of any shawarma, after the meat. The meat was also lacking, it was boney mush garbage when it wasn't super dried-out and crunchy (which it's also not supposed to be). The girl ignored us for a couple minutes upon arrival while she scraped the grill that was already clean and seemed very pointless, and this was maddening as we were standing there waiting and waiting and waiting and starving. Bad business training plus rude. I got the feeling that mgmt made a big deal about a clean grill. She was a nice kid though. I don't want to put them out of business as there's not many QSR's at Bloor/Sherbourne so I guess I should have gone to Timmies next door instead. You eat to feel better, not worse which is how I came away from this establishment and will be
854;Went in there for lunch yesterday and we'll what can I say ? The staff was nice but the food was bad. The meat was dry and tasteless. They charge an extra 25 cents for corn, cilantro and other stuff.
855;The absolute worst chicken shawarma I have had in a really long time. First, it's stupidly expensive, there's so many better  middle eastern options that are 5 minutes walking distance away along Yonge street. Second, they count the number of toppings they put on. One extra pickle or tomato slice will not make you go broke - but it will get you a bad review on Yelp. Not a fan of this franchise's food quality or quantity.
856;Bought tomyum soup and chicken smells as it was rotten. Returned the food and they gave the money back. Can't believe they actually serving rotten meat.
857;I just had the grilled chicken wrap and I already feel a little queasy. Do not eat here
858;Disappointingly rude service. The one guy who wears a hat is constantly rude. He seems to hate his job and the customers who forces him to actually work.The food is cheap but tastes cheap. I think I got sick from eating here.Avoid at all costs.
859;Shopsy's is now down to 1 star and if I could give them none i would. My most recent visit was the first day of school and everywhere was busy.  There was ONE server for the entire patio.  ONE.  I felt bad for the waitress as she was run off her feet and did the best she could.  Group of 4 arrived at 1:10 and didn't have anyone take our order until after 1:30.  We only had until 2 pm.  We ordered drinks and nachos.  The waitress could order the food from and iPad on her arm so the  kitchen got the order immediately.  The drinks however..... Apparently the bartender was MIA and so she couldn't get those for us.  We finally got our beer at 1:50.  Had to guzzle a pint very quickly because we had to go.  We paid the bill before getting everything just so we could leave on time . Shopsys - you should be embarrassed.  This is rediculous poor planning and tie waitstaff deserve better.
860;Worst service EVER.  We were seated at the back corner on plastic chairs (felt like BBQ clearance chairs) and the  waitress carelessly gives out menu and left.  Didn't bother to offer WATER or ask what we want to drink.  Never came back.  We waited over 15 minutes.  I asked another waitress who SAID she will ask the server to come by as we where ready to order waited another 10 minutes... We left.  We complained to the host and she said sorry.  Avoid AVOID AVOIDWe went to Pad Thai Express instead.  Good food, fast, quick.  Shopsy's you are blacklisted and we complained to the head office as well.
861;I walked in here today and my request to be seated on the patio, preferably under an umbrella was clearly too difficult for the hostess to accommodate so she said 'I'll let you find your table' and then handed me the menus to carry over. What now? Why yes, I'll find my own seat AND carry the menu to my table as well. Should I take my own order while I'm at it? That's just terrible customer service right there and it's really turned me off the place.
862;Service was terrible. Place was empty. Waited 30 min for a sandwich. Paid for food and left it on the table. Never going back.
863;I was really excited about this place once I saw that they had a full bar! I usually come to school straight after work and it would be nice to grab a bite to eat with a drink every once in a while. Well that was a pipe dream. Customer service: I came here within the first month of it opening. It was busy but I was seated immediately. The seating isn't that comfortable and there isn't much room to out your bag or jacket. I was dining alone so I put it on the chair opposite of me. It is noisy but I don't mind that if the food is good and the drinks are flowing. My waitress was friendly and had some knowledge of the menu but she was sick and it was disgusting. You can't have sick severs sniffling and coughing. If it is visible that your staff is sick you need to send them home it just appears so unhygienic. Food: I blame myself for ordering the lobster Mac and cheese. This place seems more like a burger/ht dog joint but I've been dying to try lobster Mac for so long. Well let me start by saying the lobster 
864;McDonald's... How hard is it? 1st...why is your coffee at Erin Mills 10 cents more expensive than the McDonald's in toronto?
865;Most useless McDonalds ever. Went to the drive through for breakfast once, I get home and notice two of the meal missing and went back to get them, they end up forgetting half of each meal, so back again, they end up telling me my next meal is free.Next time I went to Mcdonalds, They forget half of my order.  Went back still forgot stuff.Actually I have never had my order right in the last 20 times I have been here.
866;This location has the worst service I've seen. The employees argue and mess around in front of customers and it takes 15 minutes to get a coffee. I used to visit this location regularly but now drive further to another location to get better service
867;I usually go here because it's a convinient location, but the service is terrible......I once had to wait a good 10-15 minutes just for a small coffee and muffin.If you're in a rush, do not bother coming here.
868;This is the worst McDonalds in the chain.  I cant believe that all 3 times i have been there i had a problem.  First time i went there with my son and we got somebody elses order.  Second time, i went to the drive thru and got a coffee and they got that wrong too, not to mention it was only 3/4 of a cup.  Last time i had a problem and had an argument with the manager who is a complete idiot and i will never go to that location again.  The manager should be retrained if not fired for arguing over something so small with customers.  3 strikes you are out, now when i pass by that area, i keep passing by.  There are plenty of other options.  Avoid this location if possible.  Not one intelligent person works there.  Not one professioal to be found
869;What a DISGUSTING place.I ordered the "most liked" Tonkotsu Pork Soup. Most liked by who I want to ask? The broth was not hot and the taste was vomit inducing, the egg (which is half the egg) is just a boiled egg, but since it's hard to make that wrong it was the only ok part of the soup. The ramen noodles were OLD and as a result had this strange smell and tasted awful. And the pork, boy was it dry and lacking any taste.   Had this horrible aftertaste for at least 5 minutes. Ewww.I wouldn't serve this to a kid who's about to die of hunger.
870;I went to Liberty Noodle two days ago and ordered the tonkotsu ramen. The portion wasn't impressive as it left me hungry and unsatisfied. The flavour was bland and the the pork didn't taste fresh. Within an hour after my meal, I was feeling nauseous and since then, I've been stuck at home with stomach issues. I wouldn't suggest eating here. There are many other choices in the food court.
871;Not coming back here ever again. Don't ever eat here again. The food isn't the greatest and it's never consistent. The noodle was undercooked and lots of sauce that drenched the entire bowl.  The cashier was unfriendly and didn't say hello or thanks and their was a miscommunication with what I order. It was ridiculous how the cashier wanted me to pay for a new order when I realized the cashier misunderstood my order. Wanted noodles instead of rice and it cost the same price. The cashier was quite rude and defensive about it and demanded I pay for another meal. I explained that I wanted noodles instead of rice and there was a big fuss about making me noodles. I wasn't going to eat the rice and 15 mins later they eventually gave me noodles. There was a miscommunication with what I did or didn't order however it was the same price. I would have gladly paid extra if the noodles cost more  but if it was the same price it didn't make sense how the cashier demanded me to pay for another meal. Rude customer servic
872;When I saw the menu from a far, it looked good so I went to purchase  the beef pho  noodles. The cashier girls were rude and not very friendly.....they don't  seem like they wanted to be working there today. ....I had bought the pho beef noodles   &a coke . ....fine I waited  and when I received  my order I the soup was warm, there were  only five slices of cooked beef in the noodles  and not enough  soup to cover the noodles  thus making the noodles  cold. Also I had noticed that I did not get my coke, so I went back to the cashier  and let them know that she had forgotten to get my drink order . .....the reaction that  I  got was she started  to roll her eyes   and said to get it my self which was in front of the cash register . ....I thought  shouldn't  she  tell me this when I was placing my order. Anyway not worth the money.....for $7.99 go to a real Vietnamese  pho restaurant  and will get a real bowl  of pho noodles  with lots more ingredients . ....will not go back again for sure......learned  my less
873;Honestly the worst pad thai I've ever had. I wasn't expecting much. I knew I was in a food court and it wasn't going to be great, but it was SO flavourless, and the veggies and tofu were actually cold, despite me seeing the guy fry it all up in front of me.I'm not really one to waste food, but I ate three bites and that was all I could do.
874;SAVE YOUR MONEY- DON'T EAT HERE.I have never written a yelp review but had to for Liberty Noodle- because it was just that bad. I got the sesame beef noodle stir fry (because they were sold out of everything else I tried to order). I took one bite, and it was SO GROSS. Soggy noodles soaked in very salty sauce. The meat tasted boiled and devoid of flavour. I tried to eat a bit more because it was such a waste, but realised forcing myself to eat it was the bigger waste. In case you think I was expecting too much: I eat a lot at food courts, and that's all I expected. Honestly, this was like some kid over boiled some noodles and beef, then dumped a jar of cheap sauce on top. I wish I had read the reviews beforehand. Hopefully I can save someone else their money and disappointment.
875;Comparatively cheaper than most of the other soups/noodles you can get in the Eaton Centre foodcourt.  We got a pork ramen and was surprised to find the broth in such a dark colour! The leeks seemed undercooked and too crunchy still, the broth was far too salty, and the meat was pretty much half fat.
876;Please do not eat here, eat anywhere else but here.  I ordered the stir fry chili chicken udon noodles and it was cooked so poorly.  It wasn't even cooked properly, undercooked, temperature was barely even warm.  I didn't notice the issue until I had got back to my office and not worth another 15 minutes to go back and get it done right.  I was the only customer there so there wasn't a rush to rush to cook my order so this was a clear case of the cook simply not caring enough and just to expedite his work.  The taste itself is bad, the sauce they cook the noodles in was sooooo sweet it tasted like it was sweet soup noodles.This place is easily one of the worst in the food court here.  A colleague of mine informed me awhile back she had found a maggot in her food.  That should have been my red flag but human nature always lean to give second chances, but not thirds.
877;If you like Asian noodles even a little bit, do yourself a huge favour and don't waste your time or money at Liberty Noodle. I made the mistake of going here not once, but twice, and ordering the Tonkatsu Ramen since it was a cold day and I didn't feel like freezing my ass off down the street.The broth was weak and the noodles tasted doughy and undercooked. Pork was weirdly dry in some places and very fatty and sloppy in others.Then, forgetting this bad experience, I ordered the same thing again. When my memory kicked in, my heart sank as I remembered the unfortunate ramen I'd had before. Fool me once, shame on Liberty Noodle. Fool me twice... well, you get the idea.Even if it happens to be cold, walk just a little bit further and get something decent, because the ramen here is very sub par and not worth staying indoors for.Also annoyed that people leave their garbage and trays all over the place in this food court. Slobs! Pick up after yourself so that others don't have to!
878;Tried the chicken chili rice and it was greasy and boring. The sauce made everything wet, and I got tired of the flavour in about 2 bites. Many other places that would be better.
879;They get one star only because you have to give one to write a review.The most disgusting spring rolls, miso soup and sushi (Dynamite roll) I have EVER tasted!!Ridiculously expensive-don't waste your money.
880;We decided to try liberty noodles because we were looking for some Japanese ramen. We ordered the tonkatsu pork noodle soup and shoyu noodle soup. The bowls were huge but we got less than half a bowl of soup, not to mention the way they just threw the broth in, it was dripping down the sides. Not a care in the world. It was hugely disappointing, in the bowl you get half of an egg, tons of corn and a few pieces of pork/ beef. The broth had almost no taste in the tonkatsu dish. Not happy with my meal especially since it cost $8.50 and was more expensive than the shoyu dish ($7.75) but had less flavour. Avoid this place at all costs, you can literally walk outside the mall down queen or yonge and find better ramen shops for a lot cheaper. It was an experience I will not repeat! 1/5
881;So I had the pho cravings at the Eating Centre. I see Liberrhea Noodles have the pho so I order. Doh meh. Basil leaf taste like the used tea leaf. Cow beef taste like the soggy dog brains. No spring onion. No soup base. This not the Viet style.If you like the pho, Uncle Sam suggest the Chinatown one. So authentic you hear owners signing along to the Vietnamese musics.
882;This place is terrible!  They bring you in with their modern esthetic but the final outcome is, for lack of a better word, gross.  I ordered a noodle dish with ramen noods and sesame beef.  I received a huge bowl of food but it was basically noodles and a greasy sauce with tough pieces of beef.  I could not finish my meal because it was far too oily.  There are so many other GOOD options in the food court at Eaton's Centre.  AVOID.
883;Incredibly salty! Ordered the Sesame Beef Udon Noodle Stir-fry... Will never come back again. A complete waste of money as it was inedible. Very pricey too.
884;Do not go here for lunch.   It took 30 minutes for me to get my order since they missed it and did not even apologize.  I ordered the spicy chicken lo mein ...it was average.  My sister ordered the beef bulgogi and it had a weird taste to it.  I'm definitely not coming back.
885;Don't come here! The food is gross. There's a maggot in my noodle!!!! I am reporting it to the Dine Safe program run by Toronto Public Health.
886;I do not recommend Liberty Noodles. I decided to try something new at Urban eatery and I regret it!The fast food joint seemed to be decently busy as there was a short lineup (not comparable to the lineups at the usual fast food establishments). While in line I saw their pre packaged gyozas and it was definitely a warning sign as those dumplings did not look appetizing- sadingly I missed the signal and ordered the Tonkotsu ramen. When a menu item has a thumbs up and it looks like a noodle bar..you think they would  know how to cook decent noodles right?! Unfortunately not, my noodles were undercook and it was borderline inedible. The soup base was bland and boring and nothing like a good bowl of ramen. The condiments included bamboo, thin slices of cha siu, half an egg (not runny), seaweed and corn. By the sad looks of the bowl, it was lacking something....For the price of this ramen, I would definitely just go and line up for Santouka, Sansotei, or Raijin in the areaAlso to note, my fiancée ordered a spic
887;Ordered a ginger chicken soup noodle. It's the worst tasting noodle I've had in my life. I would give a zero or a negative if I can. I didn't expect much from a food court place but this is unbelievably disgusting. The soup tasted like water and the chicken tasted like card board. Honestly a three year old can make it better than them. I had to eat something else to rinse away the disgusting flavour this noodle soup left in my mouth. If you can't cook, don't open a restaurant and waste precious food. My advise: don't go there, not even if you're starving.
888;I sent back my sesame beef noodle dish as it tasted like fish only to receive a second noodle dish (they selected it for me without giving me a choice) that was equally dissatisfying (overly sweet chilli chicken udon). The staff was condescending and did not believe me that the first dish tasted off, even to the point where the staff member tasted my noodles in front of me to see if the fish flavour was really there!  I will never eat here again, lesson learned!
889;Not going back! No idea how much salt (or MSG that isn't 'added') is in their food, but I was left with a migraine and feeling incredibly irritable and unable to concentrate for nearly an hour after I'd eaten it. Should never have deviated from Urban Herbivore, which is my usual Eaton Centre go-to.
890;Just horrid! Ordered beef chilli ramen that I just could not eat. You can see the food prep area and I should have took a hint as I saw they are chopping veggies without even washing them  ...
891;I wanted a healthy soup. And I love soups. I asked what was ramen made of and the nice lady said egg. I then asked if any flour was used and she said 'no it's only egg'. Over the dinner I looked this up online and couldn't find any 'only noodle and no flour' soup. I went back to clarify and she said that's all the staff are told and didn't have any more info as it was all egg only. I asked if someone could call me and clarify, negative. So i was given a business card. Is it that simple ? I am on a special diet where I can have rice but not wheat. Had I been informed that yes egg ramen has wheat I would have just gone for the rice noodles. When I asked to speak to someone senior she said I should come back tmrw. (?)Really, is that what customers are to do? First we got wrong info and then zero process to fix. Yes I was offered a refund or another meal, but I really doubt that's happening again. Pretty crap, I'm sorry but this doesn't cut it for good guidelines or information or service.
892;Meh. Fast service but my stir fry was really really really salty and tasted nothing like bbq pork. Even hours after eating it, my mouth is still begging for water. Also it's expensive compared to what you get from other places around Eatons and Ryerson.
893;THIS PLACE DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE 1 STAR. Seriously, do yourself a favour and don't go here. SERIOUSLYYYY! I've never been so serious about anything in my life. If you go, at least stay away from the chili chicken udon. SERIOUSLYY!!
894;As a glutard, I'm always on the look-out for new gluten free lunch options, so I was  optimistic when I saw Liberty Noodle's menu proclaiming almost any menu item can be made 'gluten free'. The cheery cashier confirmed that indeed the Chili Chicken I so desired can be made gluten free! Well, be warned....most  dishes can be made with rice or rice noodles, but will still contain soy sauce. Cross-contamination in the kitchen is also a real possibility.Hey Liberty Noodle, if you are going to  jump on the GFree band wagon, great---but then you have an obligation to be responsible.Needless to say, I am having an uncomfortable afternoon.
895;The curry pad thai says it's "liked" on the menu. Stay away from it! Sauce tasted the ketchup. I couldn't taste any curry.I'm willing to try something else there as maybe it was just a bad sauce... but by all means.. don't get the curry pad thai..
896;I always come to liberty noodle, all the way from Vaughan to eaton centre to eat the best beef pho. Today I order the same thing for me and my mom and we find our soup all red, dark and cloudy . I've been having the same dish from that same place for months and it's always a clear beef broth. And that's even what the picture shows on the menu. Nothing should be different about it. Even the meat was very dry, overcooked dry. When I went back to ask the girl at the cashier and the one who prepared it, they were very rude and they just said beef pho is always like that! I've never had a beef pho that bad.I'm disappointed in the quality of food as well as the service. Employees are rude
897;Terrible service!!! I placed my order (cashier asked me twice what I wanted) then waited 30 mins because she forgot to place the order!! I also got a miso soup with my meal which they poured too early so it was cold by the time I got my actual dish. Once I was finally able to eat my food I was hugely disappointed. The miso soup was too salty and the bacon kimchi stir fry had a weird smell to it. Don't go there. Save your money.
898;Went to eaton center to buy some Christmas presents. We were hungry so went to the food court to get something to eat and I'm craving for some noodle soups cause is cold outside. Saw this place liberty noodle seems ok cause there is some peoples line up to buy food there. So I ordered the shrimp Tom Yum pho for like $10 something. It only comes with 5 shrimps, noodles,mushroom and cilantro. Noodles is too soft and soup doesn't taste like Tom Yum at all. This place is not recommend for any pho lovers. Eaton centre should find a better company to take over this stall so that people's don't get rip off.
899;The worst ramen noodle I ever had. Since this is in food court, I didn't have high expectation. However I didn't realize it was that bad. I was surprised it was still in business base on here it has a huge Asian community. The food court is great nevertheless but this noodle house needs some work.
900;This was the most DISGUSTING food I have ever eaten. FULL OF MSG!!!I got the curry pad thai which was the only option that could make vegan. The chefs had no idea how to make it vegan even though their menu clearly stated that they could make most options vegan upon request.   Their website said that their food is healthy but it contains a horrific amount of MSG. I have a severe sensitivity to MSG so I became incredibly ill. When I explained to the cashier that my meal was disgusting she did not do anything to rectify the situation. WORST FOOD IN THE WHOLE FOOD COURT. NEVER GO THERE.
901;I think the head office needs to step foot in this restaurant and fix the service before the name is ruined. I've been to tons of East sides and the Whitby location is awful. I live in Brooklin and will drive to Oshawa instead of this location which is much closer. Service is terrible, food is awful. It use to be good, now it's just plain awfulYes I have tried this many times just to see if it's an off day but it's not. As many reviews have stated it's unfortunatly gone way down hill.
902;If you like waiting for a table, this place is for you. We waited one hour and twenty-five minutes before my wife spoke the manager (male manager).  They finally sat us in the bar, why didn't they give us a table in the dinning room is baffling to me. It was a little late to say anything to them since they had sat an other family that arrived after us in the dinning room. The waitress came by and skipped my wife completely.  Was it because she spoke to the manager?  We don't know! Then when the waitress came back my wife told he what I don't get anything to drink?  The waitress then went back and started pointing out my wife by pointing at her saying she's a......  this upset my wife, she then approached the female manager but all she could say was I'm going to call the police. Then the male manager came back out and spoke with my wife and she explained the waitresses behavior. He said he'd take care of it. We got an other waitress. At this point my wife and I weren't hungry so the kids ate and we didn't. Our
903;Ughhhh I really want to like this ESM but they're consistently crappy in terms of their speed of service. We've ordered delivery more than once and waited OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF for our food to arrive each time. What????The last time, our food arrived hot but my cappeletti were half hard on the inside and my salad had brown edges. Like really? I used to work at ESM in Pickering and I was in charge of delivery service and I would have NEVER sent out brown lettuce. I also consistently get the heart of a head of lettuce in my container - that's not edible and I don't want it on my plate. Seriously ESM, get your act together! Stop sending out crappy food and get faster at it. I don't care how busy your dining room is, 1.5 hours plus for delivery is UNACCEPTABLE when we're ordering basics that take less than 10 minutes to put together and salads that are already made. We'll be avoiding this location from now on and I suggest you do the same.
904;Not like the old days. The food generally is AWFUL, and the service can be spotty and done by inexperienced staff. I take the odd client there, so I do have to go a few times a year. But I think this is regurgitated Franchise Food with no passion, very little taste or seasoning, and it can stand a big-time improvement in this area. Not for me.
905;It was very busy we went on a Saturday night. The only good thing was their all you can eat fresh bread, although we got one that was still frozen in the centre so that was a little off putting. Their Cesar salad had LOTS of dressing and the croutons are extremely hard. Over all it is similar quality to a Macdonalds salad or some place similar. We both got the penne broccoli alfredo and it was extremely bland. The broccoli was very watery and obviously previously frozen. Overall the service was quick and the food came out fast but it is massed produced and probably came out of a can, so big whoop. Overall it is a more expensive fast food restaurant. There are much better Italian places in the area!
906;Ordered an arabbiata chicken w pasta dish for dinner... got  food poisoning. The ensuing 8 hours is definitely amongst the worst nights of my life.
907;Bye bye East Side... looks like this chain is in freefall. After a terrible Take Out experience a few months ago (based on under training and under staffing) we went in for supper. First, they have killed their Coca-Cola deal for one with Pepsi. Never a good idea to give up the Number One Supplier for the Number Two - looks like Pepsi gave them a great loss leader deal just to stiff Coke, knowing that it won't last long, so it won't cost them that much. Second, portion size is slashed by at least half on the lasagna (you can have the second half back for an extra $5 - basically taking the cost of the original size meal up by over a third).Third, the taste is off. Using cheaper ingredients and less skilled staff can do that.Fourth, table service was terrible. So that's take out service and table service that have taken a bad hit.All of this points to a desperate dive to the bottom, slashing costs and portion size and service level to an totally unacceptable level, to try to stay alive. Bye Bye East
908;I feel like this place has gotten worse and worse. I used to go there sometimes for lunch and even though the food is overpriced it was decent enough quality. Last time I went I paid $17 after tax for a combo and the rolls were terrible. Even with the lack of good sushi options in the Path I'll skip this one next time.
909;After walking past this place for a year, I finally decided to go in.  It took me so long to try out this new sushi joint because I thought the menu looked a little overpriced.  This day I decided to treat myself.  I ordered the Seafood Ramen with Tonkotsu broth.  The portion was pathetically small, and the broth was bland.  I inhaled it in 5 minutes and was nowhere near full.  To be absolutely fair though, the ramen had a good variety of fixings.  It had shrimp, salmon sashimi, imitation crab, half an egg, bamboo shoots, seaweed, bean sprouts and tofu.  TINY, TINY pieces of the above.  I went back for a sashimi combo.  It's fast food sushi so it was just sashimi in the clear clamshell - normally I'm too good for sashimi in a box but I thought it looked acceptably fresh.  The selection was boring.  Salmon, tuna, some white fish that was probably tilapia, and imitation crab.  The soy was cool though.  They have their own special Sushi Shop blend.  It was slightly sweetened, so I didn't even mind that it 
910;Great food and great value? Not really! What happened to their chicken now?  I ordered two leg dinner.  They've gone smaller.  Fries were oily, soft like they've been sitting there for hours.  My order came in raw inside.  How can they not cook small chicken properly?  I told the waitress and she said she can have them cooked more.  My husband's order were perfect and not red inside.  She took my plate and re-grilled both chickens legs.  I got them back tasting like the greasy grill and dry. I didn't eat them and said just pack them.  No one wants to eat them at home so they went in my green bin.  They look so good in the picture.  Plump big and juicy...beautiful fries. But in reality, a total disappointment. After all, I didn't get good value for my money.  When I receive Swiss Chalet coupons in my mail, they go straight in the garbage.
911;Horrible service. Bad attitude. Won't accommodate a car seat and stroller. Not a family friendly restaurant. Won't be coming here anymore.
912;Hmm not a fan of this swiss place. I had the chicken from swiss chalet usually I have better chicken. This time not really . salad was not fresh and seemed old so I am not a fan of it. Servers omg where do I start they have old servers like come-on hire something younger. Servers were not bad but I would expect something better for the eyes. Over all I hated the place Cuz it did not meet my expectation of swiss chalet and I am not a big fan of swiss chalet in general as nothing is special about them. Their special dip is ok.
913;The service us horible my children got cold food and all of us got food pose Ning never came there since
914;Two weeks ago, we decided to grab swiss chalet for dinner because We missed their chicken and fries. After we were sit, we waited for twenty mins, and no one came to us. We just left the restaurant. This time, we think it might be better if we do delivery, so that we can get the food we want without getting ignored in the restaurant. To be honest, the food quantity has gone down. They didn't even get the order right. They got one of the side and the drink wrong. Also, missing one set of utensils. Don't know what they are doing. The sauce looks less than usual. We won't go there, or even order online from them again. I still like swiss chalet. I have tried the one in DT location. It is much better than this location.
915;Ordered take out for the family. Quarter chicken weren't not cooked properly and had blood in them. Pies were cut so small. Told the Manager his response was "it is what it is." What a jerk but I told the customer service number and they fixed the order. Still what a terrible manager.
916;Ugh I really can't stand the food. In any Swiss chalet location! It's so bland! And boring and extremely over priced! I'm way better off getting a rotisserie chicken at any longos or Cosco and be much happier with a much Juicer and flavourful chicken! I can even get organic for less $$
917;Over-hyped rotisserie chicken. We are all familiar with the ads, jingles, and the rotisserie channel. I fail to see what's so Swiss about it.I came here because I got coupons by mail. Chicken is bland and not well cooked, I had better rotisserie chicken at multiple grocery stores. Gravy is slightly less meh than KFC's. I ordered the salad with my meal but I wish I got fries instead as the salad was not fresh and very disappointing. Service was quick but I would much rather wait a little longer for a well cooked chicken and a freshly prepared salad.Feel free to check it out if you have coupons. Personally I would much rather grab a rotisserie chicken from Loblaws along with a bag of salad mix.
918;What just happened?  You really need to make me feel unwelcome and horrible to receive a  1 Star from me.  It just happened today.After wanting to try Nando's and not wanting to wait forever for a seat, we decided to go to Swiss Chalet.Sat with one of the servers we have seen for years...I do mean years.  She was there for almost a decade and we've been coming here for almost 17 years (including when the old location was on Weldrick and Yonge.)One not so advertised specials is a CAA deal. Two quarter chicken dinners for $15.99 - a saving of $3.49.  It's not much but why not take the discount if you're ordering it anyways - right?We have a new account from CAA.  For now, we have a temporary card + an account number in the event we need their service.  We ordered the deal and a couple of other meals.Before we even got our drinks, the manager came by demanding a card or the account number.  He did not even introduce himself and was aggressive.  We were told that the deal can not be processed without proper 
919;This place is just horrendous. Years ago i remember coming here as a child and actually enjoying their chicken. I had always ordered their quarter chicken dinner with a side of fries. I had remembered it being tasty. Upon going recently and ordering a childhood favourite, it looked like the chicken had shrinked making it a 1/8th chicken. It was bland and tasteless. Yuck! I definitely do not recommend this place.
920;I wouldn't go any of their restaurants. Menu card is poor and chicken they serve you can get from metro store is similar. I would expect better quality. While I was sitting in the bar it took nearly 10 minutes for bartender to ask if I would like to order anything. I would assume most of appetizers is pre cooked and they basically just warm it up.
921;Ordered a mango juice with my food they gave some random mango pop which tasted rotten. When I went back to ask for an exchange they were very rude about it and refused to either give a refund or exchange the drink.  I am extremely annoyed and will never go back here.
922;Absolutely disgusting! Don't order the Persian grill, it is not comparable to real Persian kabobs. The meat is just flavoured junk, not real meat! If you really want to try it order something that's not ground up so you can actually see the meat!
923;I ordered a vegetarian plate and they gave me chickpeas cooked in bone broth! I will never ever go back.
924;Paying $6 for a bowl of spicy salty nothing is not exactly my favourite way to go. Furthermore, as I work in the building I have run into the owner more than once in the food court and hallways. Not only is his restaurant dismal and flavourless, but he himself leaves much to be desired. Pro tip: don't have ignorant, intolerant conversations where the world can hear you. No wonder your employees look miserable. I can only imagine what they have to put up with, considering the things I've heard come out of your mouth.
925;If you want bland tasting soup, this is the place for you. Usually I stick to my other soup provider, Soup Nutsy, but it was late in the day, my lunch wasn't filling enough and this place always has a line up at lunch, so I figured that they must be good, right?Wrong. I ordered their small beef barley soup which smelled good but the taste didn't match up. The consistency of the broth was thick and gelatinous, it didn't taste like beef at all. I paid for $4 for something that wasn't even appetizing and that I couldn't even finish. Disappointing and a waste of my money.Plus they don't have Interact - what an inconvenience! I had to go to the nearest bank machine to take out money to pay for crappy food. If I could give this place no star, I would. It deserves it.
926;Maybe the mistake was in getting a sandwich at a place called "Soup It Up". I've had their soup though, and it wasn't all that better...I choose places with freshly made sandwiches because I'm a little picky about what goes on them. Today my bread was sliced with a knife that already had mustard on it. Unfortunately, mustard and I are not friends. The guy at the register offered to ring through my sandwich while I was waiting. Nice. Except, when I turned around to give some direction as to what went on my sandwich - it was already wrapped up and in the bag, with no question as to what I might have wanted on it. Fail.They had a basket of bananas at the register. FYI - they charge $1.14 for a banana.  I can get a rip off banana at Starbucks for $1.00, thank you very much. Apart from all of this, it was probably the most offensive tuna sandwich I have ever tasted (like spit it out in a napkin bad). And I heart tuna, but I did not heart that sandwich.
927;I wish I could give it a zero. I decided to give it a try today since I'm vegan and not a lot of places offer options for me. They had a deal for $8.29 for a soup and a sandwich and I though I would give it a try. I got a regular size vegetable soup. Then when it came to the sandwich all the put was lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and asked me what else I want to add...I look and there was nothing else, but beets. How do you offer a veggies sandwich and have nothing to put on it. then they asked me for dressings...I asked if they had anything vegan and what appeared to be the owner said...oil and vinegar! I had to say yes to that as I was not going to eat my baguette just with lettuce and tomatoes. Then when it came to pay, they charged me $12.30. I asked why and the owner said my soup was premium. How can a simple vegetable soup be a premium soup? Then he went on to argue that if the guy next door (kupfert and kim) can charge that, why cant he and that vegetables are very expensive? At the point I just stopped 
928;I know average service is okay for a fast food restaurant in a food court. But missing the items customers ordered and asking them to go back to the tail of the line to reorder is NOT acceptable, especially at lunch time.
929;Just going to echo what other reviewers have said. This place is terrible and had no business charging me $10 for a "veggie sandwich" with three THIN slices of cucumber, two thin tomato slices, and rubbery lettuce. Should have read reviews before I went. Absolutely disgusting and waste of money.
930;just had the vegan vegetable soup - very bland and salty. also, how is a vegan soup with mostly carots and a few beans a "premium soup"? def not worth $6 for a small. will be sticking to soup nutsy.
931;bland and overpriced. much better souvali you can get from other greek places for the same price.
932;This place just scammed me by overcharging for a gatorade. I hate business owners who make up prices on the fly. I get even more livid when I see them doing this to poor kids. Disgusting.
933;I went here the other day with my boyfriend. The owner deceived us into getting two souvlaki chicken dinners when we weren't that hungry- he told us one wouldn't be enough. He was very nice about the whole thing- even made it seem like he was throwing in salad and stuff for free. When we go to pay the total came up to $45.. without drinks or anything. Just two sticks of chicken souvlaki and some potatoes and rice. This guy needs to stop robbing people, or at least make the food worth the outrageous price.
934;I went in for a Greek salad one day and he made it, it was small and it was priced outrageously.  I should have asked the price beforehand.  I made this mistake twice.  I went in late after a pub crawl with my husband and we ordered pitas.  The prices are not listed.  As we were waiting for our order I confided in my hubby that I'm pretty sure I was ripped off before by the place.  He asked the price and the guy wouldn't give him an answer and just kept saying "what does it matter?"  He charged us $20 for 2 pitas!!!  What could we do?  We went to pay debit and he tried to charge us $40!!!!  Yeah, we'll just take care of that in cash, buddy.  Never again and highly advise against this place!
935;Unbelievably bad and disgusting.I honestly cant believe the owner thinks its suitable to serve what he does.  I went into this place on a sunday evening and ordered a souvlaki on a pita.  There is a a grill in the place, stove, etc.  So I was expecting to see him throw some chicken on the grill.  No.  He went into the back popped some disgusting monstrosity into the microwave and stole $9 bucks from me.  Yes $9 for a souvlaki on a pita...that was microwaved.  Now i realize I should take some blame for this, once I heard that microwave going I should have asked what the hell was going on but It was late and I was hungry.The worst part about this ordeal is when I got home to eat it.  So I'm thinking maybe he had previously grilled it  because he didn't want to cook anymore that night, which is absurd to begin with.  I open the thing up and realize it was never grilled. For some bizarre reason this place makes their souvlaki in the oven.  Oven!  Not only that, it was drum stick and thigh meat, dark meat for 
936;I was craving something greasy, so grabbed a poutine from Wing Machine and took it home. I wasn't expecting it to be anything special...I'm glad I didn't have high expectations, because it was awful. Still, it was greasy so I was reasonably happy.Until I was half way done, and noticed dead flies floating in the gravy at the bottom.
937;Some time ago, we ordered from Wing Machine and got their (entirely mediocre and forgettable) wings. That would've been fine, except we were double-charged on our credit card. I called them several times, and ended up even going in to the restaurant -- twice -- to talk to the manager, but never got a response.The first time I went to the restaurant, the person had no idea what to do the second time, the manager took my receipt and promised to look into it, but never did. In the end, I'd spent so long trying to get a refund for the double-charge that I couldn't even contact my credit card to do a chargeback, so I guess they "got away with it."If you're looking for mediocre wings and indifferent service, go for it. Otherwise, look elsewhere.
938;I've been in the food business for 42 years. What I received from the swing machine was pre-cooked barely warmed up I could not tell how long they have been sitting they were so dry they were so tasteless. I phoned and they gave me. Five dollars off of my next order they should've come and replace them right away. So that five dollars is useless the kids I will not order the wing machine ever again
939;Decided to take a chance ordering through Uber Eats as it were only 1/3 that were open at the time. We got ribs, onion rings, and garlic bread with cheese because we didn't expect much, and you can't really go wrong with onion rings and bread. Gross. We were wrong. The ribs were like frozen No Name ribs with some sauce drizzled over them. The garlic bread with cheese was actually inedible. Thinking about it again is making me feel queasy. It was a 12inch sub SLATHERED in butter. It didn't not taste like garlic nor was it toasted. It came in a sub bag that was full of grease and when I took it out I realized they melted the cheesed then closed it so when I opened it only one side had cheese. Truth be told, I think they slathered butter on it, cheese, closed it and then heated it in the microwave in the bag it came in. I wish I checked out these reviews first!
940;We were very excited about the prospect of wings tonight and turned to yelp.  Sure enough: wing machine delivers.  The wings unfortunately were disappointing.  The were small, dry and tasted a little rubbery.  For the price - $48 before tip - (assuming 1.5lbs/person and fries) there are far better wings to be had in the city.  We had a handful each and tossed the rest.
941;This nightclub/restaurant which adjoins the Staybridge Suites on Hurontario, seems to function reasonably well as the former and not at all in the latter category.  A Friday night found a pretty chilled environment with two DJs who, although they had enabled the "AUTOMIX" function on their Ableton Live software, picked the right tracks to keep the smallish crowd dancing.  Drinks were good, if a little pricey.  Service was slow and pretty much devoid of even the most basic of pleasantries.The true nightmare comes to the food portion.  If you go DO NOT ORDER FOOD.  No, it's not the worst food ever - but every single dish was just - off.  As in - not at all right.  Not bold choices by a chef, rather someone with ADD flipping the pages on "Cooking for Dummies" waaaay too fast.  If you do go, eat first - you'll thank me.
942;Same person serves as hostess, server, bartender, bus boy (and maybe chef?) so service was slow even with less then 8 people in the entire place. Decor was nice, didn't bother to eat - just drank - at the suggestion of an earlier post.  Drinks were strong!  If I weren't staying in the hotel next door, I am certain there'd be no reason for me to ever come to this place. I expected Gordon Ramsey to enter at any moment for a Kitchen Nightmare episode. Place needs a refresh.
943;Great atmosphere, decent food and thats about it. Food came on time, but we waited almost an hour for the bill. Finally when the bill did come through, they messed up the bill twice. Then the manager or owner, decides to come to our table and very rudely ask "What's the problem?" Would never recommend or come back here again.
944;My brother and I paid a LOT of money for two pasta dishes while on travel here: a mediocre penne arabiatta and a funky, unhygienic linguine pollo y fungi. The latter dish actually came out tasting like it was spoiled. I generally would let it go, but I feel that for a restaurant that charges such high prices, this is really unacceptable. My dish wasn't even safe to eat. I will be calling this restaurant to get my money back. In the interim, I would warn others to be careful and avoid this place.
945;Hi everyone I went to albertos tonight to watch a leafs game.they have a lot of sports chanels. They also had a deal for wings buy one lbs get one free but only for football games so I was lucky I got one lbs of honey mustard wings full price since the football game didn't start they gave me 10 wings. They weren't the best I've had. I then ordered the deal they had and they only gave me 8 wings in each lbs  and to top it off I seen the owner munching on wings now I wonder what happened to my missing wings To summerize crappy wings Crappy dealsCheap and fat owner
946;What I'd give to have the old John Anderson's on Yonge Street back, with Vic and his great crew!This particular location, on the border with Scarborough, is one of the last remnants of a once popular dining destination. It is small, has limited seating, and is mostly geared toward take-out orders.I passed by one day, and having had so many great memories from my youth of the old location on Yonge Street, I decided to give it a try.What a mistake!Feeling extra hungry, I ordered a Banquet Burger with Fries, Onion Rings and a Coke. A simple order that not only took 15 minutes to complete but that they somehow got wrong. After actually having paid for the meal (and while I was waiting for my order) the staff told me they made a mistake and had me pay extra for the bacon on the burger. Not sure how they messed up one of their signature dishes, but they did.Trying to explain to them that they were the ones that bore the onus for their own mistake turned out to be fruitless. Apparently, they think that t
947;Went in about a month ago with my sister. Blast from the past as We ate there frequently growing up.  The decor is the exact same the food is horrible.  Ordered a souvlaki and fries (to share). We were the only people in there and it took 25 min. The place is so dirty, I was almost afraid to eat the food. I should not have. It was disgusting.  Should have been a clue that we were the only ones in there
948;I've lived in the area for over 20 years and this place has become terrible since John Anderson sold it to the new owner a few years back. The burger patties have gotten thinner as well as the portions for all the options I've tried recently. The cheeseburger I ordered was a joke for almost $5. The prices have steadily gone up with little justification as the food is now terrible. Won't be coming here anymore.
949;Horrible customer service also the salad and meat not fresh  had a tummy ach after eating their food.
950;I ordered the number 9 off of the menu overtop, which is the falafel plate, but they gave me the mediterranean salad plate instead. I think something went wrong with the staff's training, because they did not know the menu, and the cashier kept on telling me I made the wrong order. She said that the number 9 is the mediterranean salad, when the menu CLEARLY states that it's the falafel plate. After I pointed that out to her, she tried to fix the situation by giving me 2 falafels instead of 4. She would NOT offer me a new order, which is what she should've done.The falafel was burnt at the bottom and it was also hard to eat. It was literally so hard. The falafels were a waste of money and I just finished the salads.http://www.villamadina.com/en/menu Their website shows you that the falafel plate is last on their menu, which is NUMBER 9.
951;Don't eat here on the weekend. Why you ask? Well with one bartender who evidently must so room service man the bar AND the restaurant, it's impossible to get any type of good service. Your food ends up cold by the time it arrives, you'll wait 20 min for your check and by that time you just want to leave....
952;Couldn't tell you what the food is like here, because after over an hour of waiting and trying to place an order, I gave up and went elsewhere. Fortunately there are other food options a short walk away.
953;Was pretty excited to try this pizza. Ordered the classic sausage and cheese. Since it's online only, it couldn't tell me when it would arrive other than "ASAP" ... it was about an hour later when it arrived. It was smaller in diameter than I expected for 36$ after hst and a mandatory delivery fee and it wasn't hot. I don't think I'll be ordering from here again....even if the pizza tasted pretty decent.
954;Have been wanting to try this pizza for a while, but waited so that the place could iron out their kinks and get their delivery and timing of food execution in order.  We were hungry but were unsure of the size of the pizza, so we played it safe and ordered 1 pizza and a few sides just to make sure that if it was smaller, it would be ok because of the extra sides.  Here's what we ordered..  1 classic deep dish pizza     $25.001 order romaine hearts         $12.001 order of garlic bread           $10.001 order of crispy artichokes  $12.00Subtotal  $59.00  Discount  $0.00  Delivery  $6.95  Credit  $0.00  HST  $8.57  Total  $74.52tip for driver $8  MANDATORY ON BILL!!!total = $83Everything came on time, which was a blessing after dealing with orderit.ca last time, and we were excited to try it!When we opened the take out bags the disappointment was evident..First the salad was super uninspiring, very few pieces of "burnt" pancetta, some romaine leaves, a few croutons, and some shredded P
955;$70 dollars for 2 apps and 1 deep dish pizza was nothing to write home about. the end.
956;Terrible service, below average meals, and disinterested staff. It took our table of 12 nearly 30 minutes to have our bills settled up, all while our server complained loudly about the system they're using. I felt particularly bad for the single gentleman at the next table who was ignored for 30 minutes before taking his coat and leaving with an empty stomach. Management here stinks, and it shows in all facets of what they offer their customers.
957;Food was not good. Packaged and heated and obviously so. The waitress was nice enough but it didn't make up for the food shortcomings. Not a restaurant I would recommend, or revisit.
958;I don't really like the chicken but friends wanted to go to this restaurant, so I ordered a roast beef sandwich. It was a mash of beef scraps, not fit for my dog.  They have a really good food stylist, the picture looked delicious. Very disappointing.
959;Let's just say there's a reason why there are such LOW ratings for this Swiss chalet location - and boy do they live up to it! Earned every subtraction of a star - if I can give zero I would. I'm almost ashamed to say I've been here a few times. My last xperience before this one was bad, it took everything in me to not be short with the unprofessionally immature waitress that tabled us. But I figured I will let it pass since my family actually enjoys Swiss chalet and this is the closest location to us. However, our most recent experience has made us realize driving to Any other location will be better than going back here. The service just got worse. It was the worst sit down experience I've had in any food establishment much less a respected chain like Swiss chalet. The waitress was a nightmare and the manager (I later realized) is just as bad. Our party had 4 kids and a few adults,  all of which ordered their individual meals. The kids ordered drinks with their meal but only two arrived.. no re fills.. 
960;Just like any other person I would need an annual dose of Swiss Chalet but since there's one in the neighborhood it would be sooooo much more convenient... alas it isn't so. First visit was in December, it was newly opened and not really organized. The portions were definitely zapped by a shrink ray! The service was non existent. Actually complained to the manager and received a voucher. I felt bad but what could I do?? I left still hungry and bad service?? Come on now! Second visit was to use the voucher and to my dismay same stuff..Unfortunately I will no longer be returning..there are greater experiences to be had out there!
961;Horrible management of a restaurant! One young waitress serving half a restaurant with the seater having to leave lines of people waiting while she helped. Poor girl was literally running from table to table to kitchen, but it was impossible to keep up with all the complaints of waiting undue lengths of time for menus and water and food, and of being charged for items that should have been included with the meal. Five stars to that waitress who had a smile on her face and apologized profusely for the delays. But it was not her fault, management gave her no help. They probably pay her only minimum wage, and so even though we were disappointed with our experience we all generously tipped this girl. BECAUSE SHE DESERVED IT!!! However, I will never, never return to this location or recommend it. For shame treating your staff like chattel to line your pockets because you are too cheap to hire adequate help. Absolutely disgusting!!!
962;Food took over 45 minutes and it staggered in one dish At a time. The wrap was dry and bland, no dressing for my salad. Service was slow...it was awful
963;The worst place to eat. Servers tried , but we're overrun  by all the returns and complaints.Examples:cold food (including soup)                  Dry overcooked chicken                  Plate with incorrect items                 Charged for undelivered drinksOverall the worst Chalet in T.O. Save yourselves ,don't be fooled by their ads &specials .
964;It started with the Swiss Chalet ordering campaign, advocating the consumer to try something different that pizza. So I did, and the first order went okay (Sept 17th). The food arrived semi-warm, and without utensils. It wasn't a complicated order, a veggie burger, salad, some fries and sauce.The following week I was stuck at work last nights and didn't have time to cook. (Sept 24th) So I ordered again. Same thing, not a complicated order. Again, the food was not warm when it arrived. It took over 40 minutes to get here, and my fries were missing. Being a mild-mannered consumer I took it with stride, called the Swiss Chalet customer support hotline and advised them of my missing fries. I didn't mention anything about the cold food, didn't want to cause a commotion. I also didn't want to inconvenience the story by having them drive back out again for an order of fries. So they added a credit to my order.The following night (Sept 25th), again, late night working, I knew I had the credit so I decided to or
965;Sunday August 16, 2015 11:50amChk 9868Drivr2I ordered via phone and my order arrived at my door missing my Caesar salad.I called the order line who then referred me to the store manager. The store manager said that it was impossible that I did not get my Caesar salad..basically calling me a liar. Refuses to deliver missing caesar salad.I hang up and called customer service who give me a $10.00 credit and order the store to deliver a Caesar Salad....Fast Forward next day....Still NO Caesar Salad..WOWCalled Customer Service to let them know and Customer Service gives me another $10.00 credit and apologies. I use to order Swiss Chalet min 2 times a week.Imagine I'm / anyone is called a liar over a Caesar Salad!
966;The coffee's the same as other Starbucks'. Locations is good, lots of parking spots. BUUUUUUT, the stuff is freaking LOUD! Been here for 20 minutes and I couldnt focus on anything, they just yell and laugh, covering the nice music thats playing...mmmyeah, not my location
967;Came here for the Unicorn frap and there was a long line up - nothing unusual for Starbucks. After paying and waiting for 15 minutes, the barista tells me they're sold out. Literally just looks at me and tells me they're sold out and says nothing else. Ummm, okay... Can I get a refund? I don't quite understand why I'm solving the issue here. Usually they are supposed to ask if I want a free substitute or give me a free drink card. Call me entitled but I used to work at good ol' Sbux so I know the problem solving process. Also, the long lineups here are not without cause. I counted 7 employees behind the counter, but only one was on bar making drinks. How does this even make sense?With so many stores around the cit, I probably won't come back to this location.
968;Twice after midnight now I've had the same blonde girl with the same terrible attitude. It's the end of the world that she has to serve you. And don't ask for ketchup because she will hand you two as if it's being rationed. Zero customer service.
969;If the Kiosk screws up your total $ to pay, the manager will lie through her teeth even though my receipt is OBVIOUSLY miscalculated.Her reasons were "rounding." I know rounding, and we both know how much tax I'm supposed to pay.Turns out the kiosk didn't apply my coupon, even though it said it did. I don't mind the mistake, but the LYING MANAGER definitely crossed the line. I'm not coming back to this branch.Food: Normal McDonald's food, usual quality.
970;Prices here are outrageous for special orders. They charge a whopping $4.79 plus tax for a McDouble made "like a mac"--that burger costs only $1.69 made the regular way. The owner should be ashamed of themselves for ripping off customers like that.
971;This is a 24hr mcdonalds which gives it the one star. Other than that the people who work there are incompetent. When you askfor a straw they can't even give it to you through drive thru. They simply forget the specifics and common sense of your order
972;I visited this restaurant for the first time last week after looking for a Pho restaurant in the area when shopping. When it came down to it the Pho and the Vietnamese coffee were good, however, 2 of our main courses were not as tasty as we were hoping for unfortunately. I myself ordered a curry chicken which was gloopy to say the least and my significant other was also disappointed by her vermicelli dish in which the noodles were not properly cooked. I don't think I will be visiting back anytime soon considering the other options in the area.
973;The previous restaurant used to be a good local Vietnamese restaurant, but ever since the place switched owners a few months ago, this place does not stack up.I ordered take out, lemongrass grilled chicken on rice with two sides of beef soup. A real Vietnamese restaurant would give you the soup as part of the rice order but I had to pay for it.The chicken had no lemongrass, it was super salty and doused in soy sauce. The rice did not come with the fish sauce that is supposed to be standard. The soup was very salty and did not come with the standard onions and scallions. Just plain beef broth loaded with MSG, it appeared. I don't want to know what their pho tastes like.I didn't even get utensils or napkins!I will have to find a new Pho restaurant to go to locally. Not ever going back to this place.
974;We came here this evening for take out. The resturant was very tastefully decorated and was very clean. All the tables were empty, no one was in there eating, and we were about to find out why. We ordered our food, went shopping. Came back 15 minutes later to pick the food up. The food was very poorly packaged. They put very very very hot soup under a container of heavy noodles - the soup container buckled because the plastic got so hot and the soup ended up spilling in the bottom of the bag. When we got home we opened everything up. My boyfriend got spicy chicken soup. The soup had spilled in the bottom of the bag, so he took what was left and poured it into a bowl. The chicken and noodles came in another container. The chicken was just small pieces that were boiled, there was no seasoning on them at all. He said the soup was bland and boring, well what he got to eat of it. Most of it was still in the bottom of the bag. I got pork vermicelli. I couldn't even eat the pork. It was seasoned with some kind of 
975;My lemon drink was more like a regular lemon soda. It wasn't salty and sweet as most Vietnamese lemonades are: no sour plum, no salt. My friend and I asked about vegetarian options before we ordered, and the server said she could make anything vegetarian. That always makes me suspicious, but I didn't think much of it.  We ordered 2 different tofu vermicelli dishes, but when they came out they were EXACTLY the same, even though the server insisted on pointing out that one had coconut milk, when clearly it did not. It took a long time to settle our bill, as the server was having an argument on the phone with someone the whole time. That was really annoying. I would not go back to this place or recommend it to anyone.
976;The young waiter sent our entrees to the wrong table. Then after we ate them, he served us two dishes that were meant for another table. I started eating mine and then realized it was completely the wrong dish and told them to take it back. My friend noted that it looked like the re-plated the dish and brought it out again to the right table. When he finally did serve me my main (some kind of brown coconut curry beef on vermicelli), it tasted bitter - inedible. I had to pour fish sauce over the curry to cancel the bitter flavour. I paid for it later with indigestion. My friend couldn't eat his pho either. I am amazed. How do you ruin pho? We asked the girl at the cash if the waiter was new and she sighed and said no - I wish. Stay far away. There are plenty of good Viet places in Toronto. This isn't one of them.
977;Hanoi Bistro to a Real Vietnamese Cuisine, is like a NoName Frozen Burger to a AAA Angus Beef Burger from the KEG Steakhouse. In addition, the second time I went I found a baby cockroach in my appetizer soup I left right away, disgusting. I went to food inspection website of the city of toronto and discovered that this place had problems with pest control about a year ago. I guess they did not learn from their experience. I would bet this restaurant will be out of business within a year.
978;On a weekend evening we were the only couple there. The tv was playing foreign news channel, which is terrible in my opinion. Should at least turn off the tv and turn on some foreign music would have been 10x better and welcomed!We were not served tea! Terrible, we had to order tea separately.The soup in the pho tasted good but I had too many noodles and not enough meat. Overall it was the wrong balance of soup, noodles and meat, wrong ratio.Spring rolls were okay, nothing spectacular.Later the tea came, green tea I ordered but got a tea bag. It had no taste, very obvious it was old and expired tea bag. All flavour was gone. I notified the waitress and she was kind and friendly and was nice enough to bring me another cup and new tea bag, but that was probably from the same expired box, no flavour. I didn't bother asking again.We will not go back.
979;Service was terrible! Only three people in the restaurant and still bad. Server/cook/host/owner(perhaps) was very abrupt when we asked the meat to be changed to beef instead of pork. It's not a fine dining establishment by any means so we didn't think a simple switch of the type of meat would be an issue. Also, considering the place was empty on Friday night! We ordered the vermicelli with pork, spring rolls which is supposed to be served, as it is in any other Vietnamese restaurant I've been to, with shredded lettuce, beam sprouts in a bowl. Meal came on a plate so the flavours did not come together as they should. Also, the price at 12.99 is much higher than places like Pho Hung for not as good quality or flavour. Never going again!
980;This restaurant has really inefficient service.  They don't work fast enough to even bring the bill to your table. Furthermore, they don't even spit the bill for a small group of people - ridiculous.  Finally, they take the liberty of giving themselves 20% gratuity. I understand that its not easy running a restaurant, but this place is substandard.The food is just OK, but does not deserve the amount of business that the restaurant currently attracts.  The place is only good because of its convenient location and space.  I will not be planning group lunches to be hosted there again.
981;This is a tip to Toronto Police: I seriously suspect his restaurant is involved in some kind of money laundry.Why? How else does a restaurant stay in business with such poor tasting food and service, while being on the second floor?We were the only table served during the hour we were there 6~7pm Friday. There was another couple sat down but left after not being left along for 20 minutes.You think pho somewhat fast food and can't really go wrong, right? Not here, it's probably the worst tasting pho I've ever had.Btw, the price is even higher and portions are smaller than your average pho places too.
982;WORST PHO EVER.No flavour whatsoever. In fact soup tastes kinda weird. I was seriously wondering if it was actually pho. As another reviewer said, the soup was not even hot, it was lukewarm. Seriously? YIKES!!!! Even the meat wasn't good. Pretty expensive even if the food was good, not to mention that it was horrendous.
983;This place is pure garbage. In my mind, bad service can be pardoned if the food is good. There was nothing to excuse the bad service here. A slow and rude waitress awaits you here. She doesn't seem to want to take your food to you even though it's sitting on the counter and you're the only customer here. Ask her a question and she rolls her eyes.Onto the food.. mediocre and not filling. If there was a contest to use as little meat as possible in a rare beef pho bowl, this restaurant has won it. Not only that, it's pricier than other nearby pho restaurants in the city!
984;In short: overpriced, bad proportions, bland taste, and awkward ambiance. I came here at the recommendation of two members of our 10-person party, looking for a place close to the U of T campus. We were seated immediately, and no wonder it was around 6:30pm and the restaurant was entirely empty. The reason for its emptiness became apparent as I looked at the menu. Pho: $8.50. Spring rolls with vermicelli: $11.50. I can get these in Chinatown for less than 3/5 of the Hanoi Bistro price, and for much better quality. I ordered pho with beef and beef balls. What I received was 5 paper-thin slices of beef and 5 beef balls, barely covering a gigantic, tangled mass of rice noodles. I wound up finishing the meat quickly and eating the bland rice noodles on their own. The flavour of the soup was lacking as well. It in no way resembled the rich beef broth  at other restaurants. The beef broth is supposed to be simmered with beef bones, chunks of beef, spices, onions, etc. Instead, I got some sort of MSG + wate
985;Should of listened to the reviews. Arrived at 1220 for a quick lunch order received at 120. Server was friendly and competent but  restaurant appeared to be understaffed.Bacon Mac and cheese was anything but cheesy and creamy, oily and dried out....Second bad lunch experience at a Kelsey's Too many other choices available
986;If I could give this zero stars I would - I went there I didn't even get to order before I took off pissed off. We were starving: last time we were here a few weeks ago the service was good the food was great and we were excited to go back. Tonight was different. There was Absolutely not one customer in the restaurant it is 10pm. We waited about 5minutes with no one coming to seat us before my boyfriend started looking around. A man with a name tag walked by with something in his hand in the bar area. My boyfriend went in and spoke to an "off shift new employee" who advised him he didn't know if they were still open. About 5 minutes later my boyfriend asked this employee if someone could come seat us. The Man with the name tag came back and my boyfriend asked what time they close and he said midnight. He looked like he had no interest in serving us so when my boyfriend asked me if I wanted to stay I said no let's go. If you have no customers maybe there's a reason like your attitude and lack of attention to y
987;Came here in weekday lunch, only 2 tables in the dinning room but took it more than 40 mins to get our food. Ask the waitress just replu us they only got 1 chef this afternoon.The food is bad, my wife order a shrimp curry bowl, you never feel there is curry taste, actuall no taste at all. will never come back here
988;The worst service I've ever had in my entire life. Sat in the bar (with about 10 others) for 20 mins waiting for a server to come they never did. Absolutely pathetic. How does this place make money? Never again. Save your time. Go elsewhere.
989;Brutal service !! If you love being forgotten about. This is the place !!  Have wanted to leave 3 times so far.  Decent food & drinks when they finally bring it to you.  Paid at bar because waitress never came back. Manager gave my $ to the incompetent waitress who still couldn't make change. Total gong show. Waited & waited ... For everything.  And it's only a Tuesday night w/ very few customers.  Unless you maybe sit AT the bar on a dead night. Forget it.
990;If I could give this place a ZERO rating I would!!!!Not a good meal to be had here!Salad lettuce is always wilted. Steak is always over cooked and tasteless. Chicken is that fake stuff they inject to pump up and the grill the crap out of it. Pasta is soggy and greasy. Vegetables are rotten (I actually had to spit out an avocado it was so rotten). Fries are cold and been sitting under heat lamps. Beer taps NEED to be cleaned. Over priced for crap food, what happened to this place? It used to be really busy, I think the next time you go there the doors might be locked! The servers are rude and your lucky if they even notice you.  Having been in the service industry for years I find it unacceptable to have bbq sauce served to the table that the jar lid is so gunked up that your not able to open it. The ketchup bottle exploded one time opening it, it was fermented! Shot out and hit my daughter in the eye, she cried ketchup for half an hour while the server laughed and said she did it herself!
991;Today's experience was unreal. Got there after a movie, was told a 25 minute wait....which was no problem.... It's understandable for a Saturday evening. Got a table.....waited for about 10 minutes before a waitress came over.....and just as I was about to give her the drink order she announced that the restaurant was out of ribs.....I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE STARTED WITH "WE WERE THERE FOR THE ADVERTISED ALL YOU CAN EAT RIBS" ... the waitress proceeded to tell us that the group of 10 that was sitting beside us have all ordered the all you can eat ribs and that as a result they were out. UNREAL....how can a chain restaurant that is actively advertises something like "all you can eat" be out so early in the evening.... I guess poor management and planning... the waitress apologized but that was it... No "here's a discount for next time" or any other kind of compensation for their screw up....believe me, it's the last time visiting this location.
992;There's not a no stars option. It took 15 min alone to get drinks and was given 4oz glass of wine instead of 8oz. The glass was wet like someone had already had a drink. Another 20 min I got my food that was overcooked/reheated and had massive amounts of salt poured into it. The portion size for corn bread and sides was ridiculously small. The service overall was terrible and slow, food horrible and management completely unconcerned. Couldn't care less. I will never  return to this establishment, I suggest you venture elsewhere.
993;Mess. Been waiting for our food for 1 hour and 33 minutes. We ask the hostess what's going on and she said there is a "meltdown" in the kitchen. Ok.. Then the server comes up to us and told us not to feel obligated to stay bc he has no idea how much longer it'll be.. Wow. My drinks better be free.
994;Terrible service. Waited five minutes for someone to acknowledge my presence. Waited another 20 minutes by the pool table because I put two dollars in and only got one ball. I told two servers about my predicament but both said they would get someone else, no one else showed up. After finally being seated 30 minutes later, we wait 20 minutes for a server to come talk to us. By that time we just left. Spend an extra 10 bucks at SOCO. Right across the street. Seated and eated within 20 minutes.
995;Never had eaten at this establishment but it being so close to the rogers centre, decided to try it out. Food & service were good but the manager on duty was unbelievable. He was rude as soon as we got to the front door. We had a guest inside waiting for us and he basically called us liars and said the resto was full. We walked right past him to find our friend. Tons of seating available inside i might addCalled him over to speak with him & again he was rude, unprofessional and a poor excuse for customer service. We will NEVER EVER return to Hoops. What a disgrace
996;Horrible crappy food. Crappy layout. Crappy tvs. Stay away. They have daily specials but don't honour them on game night. The location I'm mentioning is the one closest to the ACC. Seriously. It's awful. Everything about it
997;Horrible place.. Do not go.... Service sucked and the food was worse. When I walked in I asked the hostess if they got the NFL games... I was told yes and my wife and i seated at a booth with its own tv... Ordered drinks and waiter said he could change the TV.... Ordered dinner and got ready to watch the Raiders v broncos...Oh yeah we don't get NFL package. The salmon was gross. Dried and fishy... Wife's salad not much better... Manager didn't give a shit... Maybe he should do something other then walking around....When I left I told the hostess that when someone asks if you get the NFL package and you say yes and you don't that's what I call in the USA lying....Don't go here.... Go around the corner.....I wish I could have given it no starts
998;AVOID THIS PLACE.  We went to watch the Leafs game here and it was such an awful experience we won't be back.  Once seated at our table we were ignored until we flagged down someone to ask where are server was.  I expect to pay more for cider, but not $8.15.  On game nights there is an event menu with WAY higher prices, not cool.  The food was meh for such high prices.  And the bathrooms are unclean and not stocked.  One stall in the ladies washroom went from 6-10pm with no paper, even after I brought it to their attention.  And my husband was drinking a beer that was advertised as part of a contest.  When we asked the server for details she had no clue.  We had to ask several times before being given a ballot.
999;I would give it no stars...It's my first time here... this place is gross. The fries were soggy and the chicken fingers were undercooked. Our waitress forgot our drinks and it took her 20 minutes to bring a pitcher of beer. The only reason why i came here were because the other sports bars were packed and the raptor's game was about to start. I'd rather miss the game than come here. ArghUpdate: just found a fly in my beer.....
1000;Blehhh this place is horrible. Bad service. made us wait 15 min to even get seated. No air condition inside. had to sit inside because it was so bad. server outside was running around - forgetting stuff all the time and did not even care about us. food was eh - forgot half of what we requested. Then she made us wait 30 min to give us our check....
1001;When I heard  about the real sports bar, I soon realize what a fake sports  bar is .. welcome to hoops... the service is kindna slow, food is horrible.. my tequila came from  mexico... hence why it took 15 mins to arrive and got taxed 8 ways... $16 a shot.  The fish is dry, the fries are soggy, n the calamari.. well.... the only thing Cajun  about them is the dirty water that they came from... mic drop
1002;Slow service! Terrible waitresses I ordered a 'buffalo chicken sandwich' and I got the sloppiest sandwich I have ever seen ! Two skinny chicken fingers on a bun?! Ew I told her I wanted to order something else and the waitress said sorry it's going to take alongn time so I didn't eat any of it and she still billed me for it. Obviously was not goin g to i think McDonald's would have been a better option. Save your money it's overpriced and gross!
1003;The service here was absolutely horrible. The food took forever to come and the main dish came with the appetizer. The food was dry and horrible. Overpriced. Next time will head over to real sports.
1004;I have been ordering take out from this location for years and the service and food quality have be on a strong decline. To avoid cooking dinner on a Friday night while friends were over, the following was ordered:2 orders of Chicken Wings (honey garlic and medium):-in the past we would get 8 wings per order but this time we only received 6-when I pointed this out to the server upon pick up, she said "oh, I don't know what to tell ya." -both orders were overcooked (I mean REALLY over cooked)Hoops Deluxe Nachos-the order was half the size from previous orders I have had (not exaggerating 50% smaller)-again, when I mentioned this when I picked up the order, the server didn't seem to care. She did proceed to tell the other 3 servers sitting down behind the bar about it and they all just shrugged their shoulders and continued chattingOnion Rings-did not come with the dipping sauce listed on the menu-i didn't notice this until I got homeSpinach Dip-it is meant to come with pita chips for dipping.
1005;I'm writing this review so the rest of you do not WASTE a single cent on this place.Long story short, (my honest opinion) seems like they are struggling for business, place was empty - considering there are tons of other options nearby and for that reason they seem to be cutting corners with food. They seriously water down everything, the sauces, dips etc.. I guess they have to make inventory stretch but no! it's unacceptable for the prices they are charging.I stopped here thinking how could you screw up fries, burgers and snacks you know? Boy I was wrong. My friends order the burgers which had a cold middle and my $10 poutine was a joke. It was almost rude to charge $10 for it, I would've been happier giving McDonalds my $10 for a small fries and give the cashier the change. And avoid the spinach dip, they basically take it out of a jar, grate some cheese ontop and bam, there is your $15 dip and if you don't eat it fast enough youll see the water start to build ontop. gross lol. You would think considerin
1006;Visited here for my husband's birthday on a regular summer Friday night. We waited a while to be recognized in the dining area. Pitcher "jug" are pretty flat. Food feels like it may have been frozen for a couple of months prior to being served. Service is nonchalant and slow. Go to real sports for a couple bucks extra. Cheers
1007;Service was decent. Lots of extra charges.. Even when we tried to return luke warm food. We were told the wings were great. They were mediocre... Wouldn't come back. Even the music was the a buzz kill. Not a good alternative to Real Sports Bar... We can see why it was empty.
1008;This is a great example of a time when Yelp should allow 0 stars. I don't normally like to put negative energy out but I feel like I can save a lot of people disappointment by suggesting avoidance if you want to enjoy your food. We had a really great server who was only doing their job, but otherwise our experience was not one I would like to recommend to others. Their "that will be extra charge" bit gets old really fast. Go to real sports or jack Astros and eat edible food and remember this yelp forever
1009;I am going to echo some of the other reviews of this place by saying DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE. what kind of sports bar has ELLEN on not just one but many TVs??? Oh and they sat us in a booth with a tv that didn't work. In fact many of the booths had non functioning televisions. Server had no idea what a domestic beer is. Where do I start. Hmmm how can you screw up pub food? Nachos is pretty easy, no? Well... they couldn't make nachos. If they couldn't do that what else are they incompetent with?  The nachos came out not as I ordered. So when I requested they rectify it they brought out the same nachos with cold toppings on it. Manager insists that's how they do it? Nachos and cheese go in the oven and then everything else goes on top. Ok some may agree that's how it's done but when the server tells you 'careful the plate is hot' and it isn't hot, and the cheese is partially melted, the skepticism begins to brew. My Chili for the nachos was served on the side. So it's nachos with a chili di
1010;I opened this Yelp account just to write this review.If you are looking for service of ANY kind, do not go here. Stopped by after the Leafs game on Halloween night, well before the "post-game rush". The place was practically empty. We grabbed a two-person booth in the bar area. We were sitting there for 10 minutes and not one waitress acknowledged our presence. Plenty of them walked by, but not one of them stopped at our table. One of them was just standing right at the end of the bar with a sour look on her face, a few feet from our table, I can only assume she saw us sitting there. After 15 minutes we got up and left, but not before voicing our displeasure with the service. We walk to the front of the restaurant and discover five or six waitresses all standing together talking. Again, the place was practically empty but not one waitress came over to serve us. Obviously they were too busy talking to each other. When we voiced our complaints to them about the service, all they could do was stare at us with 
1011;After some sightseeing, some friends and I stopped at Hoops because it was nearby and cheaper than the shit they sell at the CN Tower. It was hardly the experience we were hoping for. They sat us down and then proceeded to take 15 minutes to bring us drinks. We were so close to walking out and in hindsight, we would have been so much better off doing so. After waiting some more, they took our order. I had the chicken fingers with a side of gravy and my wife had fettuccine Alfredo. Waited forever again. Brought out the food and they had forgotten my side of gravy. That's fine, maybe they just forgot to write it down. What's worse though, is that their fettuccine Alfredo was neither fettuccine nor was it Alfredo. It was more like spaghetti. She said it was cold and tasteless. The whole time we're "enjoying" our meal, the section next to us is filthy. Not a single person came to clean it up the entire time we were there. All the waitresses were talking at a table in the back. Not once did they come to see if our
1012;I'd give them no stars if I could.  The bartender was good.  Please close soon so someone else can come in.
1013;Let me just say this. It's a sport bar, so your going to get pub food and drinks, but in saying that I have never had a great meal at this place and it's not cheap. The pool tables in the back are also tiny and are hard to play when there's more than 2 people. The service has historically been spotty but has been okay recently. Only reason I return is due to its proximaty to my condo and ease for a drink after a game and the pool tables, however I would check our Real Sports, St. Louis , Jack Astors, or loose moose. Food- 1/5Service - 2/5Location - 5/5Pool tables +1TV quality -1
1014;Ok....this is my 2nd review of this restaurant. I was here in 2014 & the owner "Richard" assured me they were upgrading the place. So I decided to go back.....NOT GOOD!*The restaurant was dark & dingy*The chairs that I tried were all wobbly. I looked for a non-wobbly chair but to no avail. Even the waitress couldn't find a non-wobbly chair!*The table was sticky, like it was wiped down with a sugar water *The chicken in my chicken fajitas was clearly not fresh. It had the "reheated taste" too it*The fixings that came with were bad. The lettuce was wilted, the cheese had that greasy look, meaning it had sat a room temp for a while & the overall quantity was insufficient to cover the fajitas shells All in all this was my 2nd bad experience at this restaurant. This place should just close down & reboot as a better restaurant. This is NOT a "do over", go to another restaurant there's better close by.
1015;Chose this place because of how close it is to the CN Tower and Aquarium and wanted to grab a quick bite. By "quick bite", I was thinking easy pub food, enjoy the patio for an hour and be on my way. Hoops is not the place I had in mind. To be fair, we were seated quickly, and had a n amazing view of the CN Tower on the patio. Drinks were taken relatively quickly. But from then on it was a downward spiral. Cons: 1. Dirty tea cups. Lip stick stained and my mother actually had to get up and hand the dirty cup to the waitress for a new one.  2. Customer Service. Many of the waitresses mumble, rarely give eye contact, and not very polite. Gives an unwanted feeling to the guests. 3. Waiting time. Only 4 of us seated and we all ordered basic pub food, burgers, wraps, chicken. But almost an hour wait for the food. Not sure what happened there. Overall, Hoops doesn't have slam dunk potential. Go for the booze.
1016;What a Shit Hole!!!Service is subpar, how does a restaurant run out of food and offer no substitution or accommodate requests???Steer clear of this dive!!!I will never come back here again were a table of 6 and 3 of our orders are screwed up and/or the kitchen refuses to accommodate requests and allergies.
1017;Horrible bar and grill. DO NOT GO. Got scammedHeaded over to this bar after work (6ish), and the place was half full inside. Immediately noticed that the place is really warm, probably in the high 20s with a lack of air circulation. Asked to move to the top fmfor more ventilation... no issues. After we sat down and asked ordered a beer with wings special, the waitress came back and told us that wings are not discounted during 'busy hours'. No where online or in the bar shows this restriction... and that we had the pay original price... should have told us BEFORE you served us our beers or even sat down. The bar wasn't even full and there weren't games going on at acc or rogers centre... Service was mediocore but place is way too warm and I felt scammed after that experience. Restaurants cannot just make up a rule all of a sudden...
1018;As I was sitting down to eat dinner in my condo, my building erupted into flames. A friend passing by on the street phoned me to say that my fire alarm was legitimate and so I promptly evacuated the building. Thirsty from my 42 story descent, my friend kindly offered to buy me a beer at Hoops next door. I happily accepted and we took a seat at the bar. Later I was joined by two other displaced neighbours and we ordered a second round of beers.Having missed my dinner due to the conflagration, I grew hungry and asked for a food menu. Realizing wings were on special I reviewed the sauces available and was intrigued by the last sauce "teriyaki and jerk." In a classic case of confusion brought on by the lack of an Oxford comma, the waitress informed me that those were two separate sauces and not a unique Japanese-Jamaican fusion. Saddened, I ordered wings with a different sauce.Sitting with my fellow evacuees we drank our beers and I waited for my wings. We hypothesized how long until we would regain entry to 
1019;If you drink beer, I probably wouldn't go here.  The staff are super nice though. If you would like to know more, sit at the bar at the raps and watch the show.
1020;My First yelp review as a "Toronto" Yelper!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and sigh... I'm giving it 1 star- what a rough start. Not to mention that I moved back to Toronto from Vancouver to watch a Game 6 Stanley cup playoff game too. What was I thinking not to book my flight one week later?Anyways - back to my experience at Hoops.From the moment I sat down, I felt like the waitress was hounding me for my order. I felt rushed and uncomfortable. There were crumbs in my water, which is never a good sign.Their bar rail (house hardballs were $4 after 7) options didn't include caesars, but I was not informed of that information. In addition to that - their menu needs to be up to date. Being particularly picky yesterday, I wanted the Amsterdam Blonde in a bottle - she brings me back a huge glass, which once again, I was not told it was not in bottles, and if I had known, I would've gotten something else.... I was in a bad enough mood already.The quarter chicken dinner I ordered was...
1021;I can only review service and quality of "cocktail" I ordered.  I wish I could give 1/2 a star.  My hubs needed to use the washroom, so I thought we might order a drink to use the facilities here - color me completely stoopid :/We flagged down the bartender, from chatting up her fellow employees, as she had her back to the bar patrons.  When I got her somewhat divided attention, she was perplexed by my order -- margarita on the rocks with salt.  I had pull like taffy from her, which tequilas she had to offer.  Once I got the list of two (I can't make this up), she wanted to know if my "on the rocks" margarita was frozen.  I thought explaining "rocks" just meant over ice cubes, it would help.  It didn't.  I finally got a tall glass full of margarita mix only for $19.  Add $3 for my club soda.  I couldn't even drink it, as you would imagine syrup over ice would go down.  Another 10 minutes to grab her from wandering aimlessly staring at her feet or hands and we paid the $22 for leaving a full drink on the bar 
1022;This place got everything wrong. First we tried sitting inside but it was 30+ degrees and the music was ear piercing loud. We then moved outside where we were kept waiting for a very long time before we could order drinks. The experience continually got worse - very bad food, got my order incorrect as well. Overall displeased. The only reason this place stays in business is their location.
1023;Flat beer and dirty glasses.  It's a "sports bar" will extremely loud dance music.  I guess it's a "sports bar" Toronto style....
1024;1 out of 5! I do not recommend this place! Only positive is its usually empty so you can always drop in for a quick beer with friends!
1025;Location is this place's saving grace. It's still open because it's probably the only thing close to The ACC that isn't always jam packed (Real Sports) or super expensive.Came here yesterday before the Leafs game as of course, Real Sports was full and The ACC didn't open their doors till 6:30pm. Forced to go here due to proximity.Like what most other people said, there's no freaking AC at this joint. WTF guys! I was sweating my face off.. in mid October!I ordered a pint of Keiths and it came with 1.5 inch of foam at the top.. and the pint glass itself was one where the entire glass filled to the top would be a pint. I didn't bother complaining because, to be truthful, I wanted to eat and get out. I ordered the Hat Trick burger. Overcooked, and bland. The fries were okay though.
1026;Came back again against better judgment. Such a surprise that this place is still in business.Was downtown in the area with coworkers, my manager, and a few others. We were all tired, hungry, and had a hankering for some drinks and basic pub food. My manager saw Hoops in the distance and recommended going. I told him about my past experience, however I did state that it could have just been the day or the waitresses on duty therefore it may be a completely different experience this time. Boy, was I right in the worse way.When we arrived, we were told a table for five wouldn't be available for about twenty minutes as they needed to get one ready. No problem, it was midday on a weekend so it's understandable. We sat outside enjoying the sun for the time and went back in to be seated. The hostess told us that they have yet to clear any tables. Straight behind her were FIVE customer-less tables with the tables unclear. We asked if she could please get just one cleaned up so we can sit. We were told to give he
1027;Went to Hoops just before a Jays game. Was really hungry, so I ordered a slam dunk burger. Umm.. No.There was no flavour. Even with the bacon and cheese, still bland and not worth the price.  Some of my coworkers had their poutine, which they said was pretty goodThe wait staff were great, however they might want to check id.Turns out one of my coworkers was underage and was served alcohol.
1028;Wow talk about service ... Apparently the day was too busy for the server to remember my order... I ordered sweet potato fries and we were going to order deserts but they ran out. The server came back and got my friends drink orders and didn't follow up with my food, but I didn't pay it any mind. The server suggested cris cut fries but totally forgot bout it because they didn't have any deserts. When the server came back and gave my friends their drinks, I followed up and asked for my sweet potato fries she said I didn't order fries from her. I saw the original server and asked her where my order was. This person said they completely forgot to pass it on but yet they had the time to suggest the crisscut fries. They both looked at each other confused and said I can just place another order. Why would I want to when my hunger already passed. On top of that they were not sincere nor did they care. That made me loose my appetite. Moments after they came with the girls drink and no apologies. When they cleared the
1029;Bad service, asks half the table what they want to drink and since half the people asked for water she just said ill get you water and left without asking the rest if they wanted a drink.  Brought out triple the amount of cutlery as needed that took up space.  I ordered the spicy BBQ chicken wrap.  The chicken on the wrap was cold and the BBQ sauce was so spicy I couldn't get through it.  (I've eaten scorpion and ghost peppers I can handle heat)  Wouldn't go there again.  Did I mention I almost fell through my chair as the chair cushion had detached from the chair and was half off the chair.  Fun times.
1030;Went in after Jays game, seated right away and then the wait was on... 20 minutes later I asked a passing waitress if she was our server, she said she was and left without taking our order... So we left! Then politely expressed our concerns to the manager and he just gave us the long stare! A 45 minute waste of time. Can't comment on the food or the drinks, sorry!
1031;I felt compelled to leave my first Yelp review!Came here after Jays game with friends because website said Thursday night was 1/2 price wings.  After ordering and receiving 4 pints was told wings were not half price because it was an event night.  You are right next door to Rogers centre.  When is Thursday night not an event night?  The website does not say event night exclusion.  Server only kept repeating "I only work here".  No apology or agreeing it was BS.  Just a robot reply.  Ended up going to real sports bar... at least you know what you're getting... good food but pricey!  I'll take that over scamming me everyday!!
1032;Completely and utterly insulted by your waitress. ...whenever I pay a bill with my debit card I always leave a cash tip...so when I paid my bill and didn't leave a tip on the machine she asked me if there was a problem with the food or the service,  I responded no...she rolled her eyes and I pointed out to her that the tip was cash in the table....she rolled her eyes again and walked away....my husband wanted to take the money back but I left it there...I then tried to wave her down to get the manager and let make them aware of my horrible treatment. ..but she wouldn't come back...I waited by the hostess table, no one showed. ..should be 0 star rating
1033;Disgusting. After being disappointed with comicon, i came here with my boyfriend. Ordered a pitcher of Heineken which was flat. We ordered a burger meal with fries. The burger tasted horrible and the bun was falling apart. The fries were a total waste. Not worth the price at all. I would never visit here again, much less recommend it. I wish i read the reviews prior to coming here.
1034;If you happen to be coming from where I was and walking towards the Rogers Centre by way of Bremner and want a beer and a bite, you're a bit stuck. Hoops is one of only a couple of options. The service was mildly attentive, the interior obnoxious to even a big sports fan like myself (how many TVs do you need? One at the table? Ugh) and the food way, WAY overpriced. A pedestrian ravioli dish for $17.99? Yikes...I'm a lousy chef and I could have replicated it pretty easily. And what's worse, it doesn't seem as though they even feature their full menu before games. They have something called an "event menu" where my first and second choices (I looked online beforehand) weren't available! So for at least 163 nights of the year (Jays, Leafs and Raptors games) you're stuck with this limited menu? And I'm not even counting concerts, lacrosse and whatever else might constitute an "event". Now I may be wrong and perhaps this only pertains to baseball games, though I somehow doubt it. In any event, it's still pretty 
1035;this is the worst place i have been in my life, they stole my personal property, and ruined my id, i am from out of the country and this is completely unacceptable behavior from a supposedly professional establishment. i would never suggest you try this place if it could have zero stars it would. terrible food, awful drinks and beyond the worst service i have ever experienced. do not try this place!
1036;My review in August stated a poor experience in quality, wait time and service. Thanks for the comments Dave but I find it ironic that my review was about quality and waiting and it took 3 months for you to respond, and you're response was as bland and generic as the food. I will return to Toronto but not Hoops. Sorry
1037;"Un-Happy Bowel"The Korean Beef Bowl is a mucky mess of touch beef, woody greens, slimy kimchee, and a sauce that's somehow 100% sugar, 100% soy sauce, and 100% garlic (yes, that adds up to 300%... Because it's 3x as underwhelming as it could be).Skip it!
1038;This must be the most disgusting Korean rice bowl I have ever tasted. The rice is undercooked so there are little hard pieces. The beef is way over cooked so it is like cardboard.  The sauce is too salty and they put in way too much. I am thinking now should I try to finish this off or just write it off and be $11 short.
1039;Happy bowl used to be really good when it first started... Good price, good value, perfect portion... Most importantly, they served very healthy food.  I just revisited happy bowl yesterday, the food was very oily, portion was only half of what it's used to be and very expensive.  Very very disappointed. I will never eat at happy bowl again.
1040;Worst food that I've ever have in my life. ordered a noddle soup, the broth taste just like Mr noddle!!! and they only put 3 slices of beef in there!!! and it's $10!! I will NEVER come back and not recommend anyone to try it!
1041;Terrible pizza. Got my order wrong. Delivered wrong drinks. Too expensive for quality of food.
1042;The worst pizza I have had in my entire life -- took two bites and through it out. No flavor, canned toppings. Tasted like a bad frozen pizza.
1043;So the Minion toys are out @ McDonalds causing a frenzy!!!!!I have about 20 unopened happy meal toys that I have been saving up & waiting patiently for the Minions to swap them.I've always been told if my child did not like the toys I could swap them later if they were unopened.I have had success swapping the toys @ 2 other locations in Toronto.Today I tried to swap @ this location & they would not allow me too because the Minions are SO popular.I found this unacceptable! One cashier was going to do the swap for me & another cashier spoke up, they went to the manager Naseem & she wouldn't either.So poor service from my part from a loyal customer. I stood in line for 20 mins to do the swap. Disappointed!!
1044;Terrible. So off the Hakka game. Ordered a chilli chicken, it took twenty minutes for me to get it and on top of that it wasn't even decent. Chilli chicken house is way better by a long shot, and that's not even the best Hakka place out there. Honestly, I so wanted this place to be good, which made the letdown that much more upsetting. I made give this place another try, but definitely not the chilli chicken.
1045;Overpriced and the food was like Chinese McDonald's...Horrible quality. Eddie'e Wok and Roll, Ming Room and Chill Chicken House are all way better options. I wanted this to be great since there isn't Hakka nearby but it was a serious lunch bag let down.
1046;Terrible, horrid, awful.I think they added some kind of chemicals and food coloring, I got the general Tao and it tasted like medicine
1047;Horrible service! Waited 45 minutes for our food and they talked like we weren't even there. Clearly forgot to make our order of rice while the rest of the food was done and when they faced us they said "It's very busy". I told them to be honest and just tell us they forgot to make one of our dishes and they just nodded. Absolutely no organization or structure in this place and everyone waiting for their food got quite frustrated. At one point we had to start helping each other figure out who's food was coming out because they had no idea which dish went with which order. AVOID!!!
1048;This place just opened and had the opportunity to make a great first impression in the neighbourhood.. but sadly, this was not to be. Largely due to poor planning, foresight and customer service.We had a hankering for Hakka food and went to the website, it looked great, the prices were reasonable so we placed an order with the intent to pay with cash on delivery. I got an email stating what we had ordered and a confirmation. So we waited...and waited...until finally I called to find out what the deal was. Where was the food at?The man on the phone was confused and not very helpful..his response to our dilemma? 'oh we just launched the website, the takeout doesn't work, we're not delivering right now.' EXCUSE ME? why was it possible to put an order through? Why is there zero no mention of this on the website? So I placed an order on the phone, as by that time we were getting hangry and frustrated. It turns out the menu items listed on their online website are not actually available to order! We had to su
1049;Awful. I rarely give 1* star reviews, but this place warrants it. Located in the Erin Mills area, we were hopeful that this place would pop up as the next new and awesome Hakka spot in west Mississauga. Unfortunately, it's the absolute opposite.The staff mixes up orders very often (yes, my parents and I tried to give this place a chance and ordered from here a few times because of convenience). The food itself is just terrible - very strange colouring (our beef was almost green.... I know, green meat). The flavour is something you never want to experience, and the dishes taste almost like plastic with a really, really awful aftertaste.Avoid. Definitely avoid.
1050;I visited on March 3, 2017 at approximately 6:45pm and my receipt HST # is 833975121RT0001. I received very poor service from the staff members there. During the ordering process, I inquired about the food options because the labels on the glass did not correspond to a particular metal tray. The staff member responded but she could not be heard because the surroundings were too loud. I then pointed to my ear, turned my face slightly, and leaned in to signal her to please repeat what the food item is.  To my disappointment, she imitated my action and laughed at me with the three other staff members there, mumbling that I'm like a grandma. I felt very humiliated in that public environment and was seriously mistreated as a customer. I spoke to the supervisor afterwards and she profusely apologized for my mistreatment. However, the staff members did not acknowledge their unprofessional behaviour. This was my first time buying from Bourbon St Grill at Eaton Centre, and it will certainly be my last.
1051;This location is pretty bad....I have had the bourbon chicken with 2 sides and a chicken Caesar salad both no good. Never again! Don't know what they are doing differently, because other locations are sooo good. Only good thing is, that the food is hot....doesn't say much.
1052;I have ordered the scheshwan chicken as displayed in the picture menu and was truly disappointed, very bland. No spice, as I wanted to give them a second chance as chilli chicken is bad as well.
1053;I am more than disappointed with the food received! I ordered tiger prawns in general tso sauce and what I received was an insult to my love for that dish. There was a putrid smell that was accompanied by a horrible old taste.  I had two bites and told the owner I couldn't even force myself to eat that dish. He acted shocked for half a second while charging me for the dish regardless!  I read (afterwards) from a previous diner that he didn't believe that the food was fresh. I have to agree. Stale, old, possibly reused... Omg... I think I'm going to be sick...
1054;The food is not great. I have been there both times for hot and sour soup take out, and the soup is not amazing. But what bugs me is that, both occasions I specifically asked for Hot sauce packages, and both times when coming home there were none. Not even a utensil or anything (which I don't mind if I am eating at home). But the fact that this happened on two different occasions, just shows how little care they put into their customer service. The second time this happened, which was about 30mins ago, I called back just to let them know (not even to complain), and after hearing me explain above, they put me on hold to answer the call of a take out order, and after being on hold for 8 minutes I decided to just write this review instead. I can understand if they are overly busy, but both times the place was pretty empty. Today, there was only one table being served.
1055;Horrible service, messed up all our orders. Food was horrible worst hakka place in Brampton.
1056;One word: Bland! Went on a weekday and we were the only occupied table. We had spring rolls, Hakka fried rice, Hakka fried noodles and chilli chicken. While portions were more than healthy, it didn't matter as you probably won't want seconds. Bland, brown and just meh. You can get better food in a mall food court.
1057;I would like to share my experience I went in and ordered chicken on fried rice the kitchen door was left open I saw the "chef" right in front of me microwave my chicken, it was disgusting! There are better places around I'm sure that would serve food not microwaved! I was also sick the next day! Avoid at all cost!
1058;BEWARE!!!! We ordered a Hakka dinner for 2 and less than 3 hours later we were all sick with food poisoning. Our 20 month old son was so ill and all he ate was the noodles that came with the dinner. We have ordered from them maybe 3 other times and never had an issue but we will never be going back again.Awful costumer service! We called today to tell them what happened and they didn't believe us since they didn't get any other complaints. For a resolution they offered to give us the money for the noodles back. They seriously thought offering less than $10 was acceptable. We demanded back our full money back (Less than $40!) and they refuse.
1059;Everything tastes the same.. And not good. Probably they have pre cooked. There are way better options close by
1060;Horrible!! Everything taste the same and leaves your tongue numb. I ordered 2 dishes and they were ready in 5 mins so nothings cooked fresh just reheated
1061;3 times we've had bad service ... 1.5 hrs for delivery and forgot our pop and gravy.  The don't take themselves offline on JustEat when they can't deliver so JustEat refunded us the last time and advised they would be conducting a service review. Looking at the reviews below I can see nobody has really had a good experience with these guys.  I'll go to the one on Yonge street.   They know how to take care of their customers.
1062;The chicken must have been in the fridge for a while before it got cooked, or left out, or old.  Whatever it was, the next morning, I was running fast to the toilet.  Didn't have anything else questionable, so no doubt in my mind.  The meat was rotten and they served it anyway and for that, I will never go into any Popeye's for as long as I am not starving to DEATH!Fries were, ya know, fries and the biscuit was meh.  Don't think I will ever return.
1063;Do not place a delivery with them - very unscrupulous!I placed an order through just eat and when I called I was told they had already delivered it - to some woman. They then proceeded to argue with me and that no I wouldn't get my order and no I wouldn't get my money back. I contacted just eat - they had two orders to my building. No apologies and no explanation as to how they can have two orders and two payments and only deliver to one person. Very poor business with rude and incompetent staff. Just eat will refund my money but this place refused to redo the order as they are an hour from closing. Absolutely disgusting.Now it's late and I have to find an alternative - don't waste your time, try orderit.ca - never had such a problem with them.
1064;I wanted to order from Popeyes over by Dawes Road as I know the chicken is very good there and the staff are pretty good.  So I sent my Brother out for it over to Danforth Ave and Dawes Road but he went over to the store over at Danforth Ave and Logan ave.When he returned twenty minutes later we opened the Fries and Chicken and it was cold and it was so greasy it pooled in the bottom of the box.I immediately picked up the phone to call the store about the lousy mess the food was in.  That's when he told me he picked it up at the Logan Ave. store and that's when I knew that it was par for the course when dealing with the Popeyes at Logan Ave. The food it seems is continually BAD, DRY, GREASY.
1065;Crew very impolite!  and food is stale.I love Popeye's Chicken, but NOT at this store, ever!
1066;Decided to have Popeyes after seeing the facebook offer for a free large side with purchase of a family meal. Went in thinking there would be no issues... I was wrong. I ordered the 12 piece family meal and showed the man at the counter the email offer which states right at the top of the email "To use this offer show this email", then he refused and said they don't accept it and then said I needed a physical coupon... I went along with it and ordered anyways, asked for half spicy half mild...no spicy pieces found. Also no ketchup/hot sauce was provided... cheap location bad service... never go here.
1067;The place charged us 90 for a fish and their attitude was awful when my friends and I asked why is the name of the fish and its price not on the menu. They claim that it's just temporary and the fish (there was a whole tank of that kind of fish) will be gone by next week, that's why the cost is not on the menu and they even blamed us for not asking the price. They said it's bass but that bass is different than the bass they have on the menu so charged us a much higher amount. What a lousy excuse.After eating there all 10 of us got food poisoning. I strongly believe it is the famous cold chicken dish that we all ate and the severity of our symptoms directly correlates with how much chicken each person ate that day. I did notice there was some redness between the bones but didn't raise any concern at that time. Obviously we've reported this place to Public health.Needless to say, I strongly DO NOT RECOMMEND this place to anyone!
1068;FOOD POISON. ALL FOUR OF US.Apparently there are previous food poisonings from this restaurant, as seen on Toronto Public Health website.I wish I knew about it before going in there so that i didn't have to suffer through a WHOLE WEEK of diarrhea, fever, and nausea.THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU STEP IN HERE.
1069;You don't order Chinese delivery if you are looking to eat healthy, but this place takes greasy into a whole new realm.  I seriously question their deep fryer, or perhaps their chef - I squeezed an entire paper towel's worth of oil from a solitary chicken wing - and needed another paper towel ...Some of their dishes are okay, the prices are cheap and they seem nice enough, but there's just no justifying a meal this unhealthy.
1070;I went in around 8pm to get take out. After I made my order I was just standing there at the counter and looking through a mirror on the side that points directly at the kitchen. The guy at the cash was coughing without covering his mouth and rubbing his nose with his hand. I gave him the benefit of the doubt because he handled the money and not the food. Then I saw him go back and start cooking while the other people there that had aprons on were doing other things. I'm a very patient person so I still gave him the benefit of the doubt because I could see him using utensils.  As he was putting the food together some fell on the side and he picked it up with his hand and put it in. Then he used his whole hand and started pushing the food down so he can cover it. I told him "you handle money and I can see you touching my food". He said "I'll make you new one".  He then started speaking Chinese to the actual cook and pointed to the mirror. Needless to say, I didn't make a fuss, said no thank you and walked out.
1071;Feed the children!!! This is not good for you food, but the lunch deals are CHEAP.
1072;Ordered $50 of food for a family function.  It was horrible.  No receipt given, nothing .. all in all, very shady.  Used to be great at one time, just horrendous now.
1073;I got very sick after eating this Chinese food. It is not good food and the place is very dirty!!
1074;The absolute worst, I just cancelled didn't even get the food... over an hour waiting and I was told it is cooking and it would be another hour
1075;Ugh.Have you ever gone against your gut, screwed up royally and then thought, "Should've listened to my mother"? This meal was just like that, only it's more of a "Should've listened to my Yelp fam." THE GOOD:- The only silver living to this experience was the fortune cookies. You know the food is bad when you stop after 2-3 bites and go straight for the fortune cookies. THE BAD:- The wait time: 1 hour and 20 minutes. Seriously? There isn't even snow on the ground - what's your excuse? I was especially annoyed by this because JUST-EAT.ca quoted me a wait time of 55 minutes. - The food, to put it simply, sucks. I ordered Sweet 'n Sour Chicken Balls - my childhood favourite - and the BBQ Pork Fried Rice. The Chicken Balls were just okay. The BBQ Pork Fried Rice was literally just that: pork chunks and (overcooked) rice. What happened to all of the other fried rice-y ingredients (e.g., egg, peas, carrots) that you typically find at other establishments? It's beyond me. The delivery man left behind a m
1076;OMG. WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY! PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,1. Sweet and Sour Chicken totally salty and drenched in so much sweet n sour it looked like it was something radioactive. The chicken felt tough and old..doubt it was prepared the same day. 2. Fried Dumpling - they gave me boiled dumplings they placed on one side in a pan for a couple minutes and burnt. I know the difference between fried and boiled dumpings. This was just boiled that they tried to pass off as fried.3. Rice had no vegetables of anything, was old and tough as well. COULDN'T EVEN FINISH THIS FOOD IT WAS SO DISGUSTING. Into the garbage it went and I ordered from somewhere else because it was my birthday and I didn't want my meal to suck. EW EW EW. NEVER will I give this place my money again.Not to mention customer service was horrendous when I called to complain about the state of my food. Their excuse was that's how they do it. UGH.
1077;First let me say that I blame myself entirely for this review as I knew what this place was like but still chose to get a cake done here.I got a custom cake done back in 2014. I wanted a Hello kitty cake with blocks that spelled my daughters name. I also had a picture that I got off the internet in which I wanted it to resemble. The cake did not resemble the photo at all.. Worse the blocks were too big for the cake and instead to start them so that they would all fit they started them in the middle so the last block was on the edge pretty much falling off.That cake cost me $250 and unfortunately when you get a cake made for an event and pick it up the day of your event you have no choice but to just grin and bare it.If you want a custom cake with bakers who are real artists call La Creme Cakes. I had a cake done by them for my sons birthday and omg! You should see the detail work and it cost me $220. It was a minion and all the people at my party were in complete awe of it.So let's fast forward to 2
1078;BE VERY CAUTIOUS: We were a frequent customer of La Cakery for the past three years, however due to their irresponsibility and unproffessionalism we will no longer be ordering anything from them ever again! I ordered a Nutella Cake for my Birthday on July 25/16 being super excited to taste a Nutella cake...how awesome is that right? When eating the cake we all noticed that there was no Nutella in the cake at all and were extremely disappointed. We messaged Tomaso on Facebook, the owner of La Cakery and he informed us that he had in fact given us the wrong cake and gave our cake to another customer which is careless. He said both cakes looked alike but the fillings were different.  I was so disappointed as all my guests and I were looking forward to a Nutella cake. Also, I really do hope that whoever picked up our cake doesn't have a hazelnut allergy as La Cakery will have another issue on their hands. Tomaso's solution was for us to return the cake which is ridiculous and he will then give us a Nutella cake i
1079;TLDR: Expensive Inedible Cakes.I bought a birthday cake off of their refrigerated glass display thinking a dedicated bakery would be better than supermarket bakeries (I was wrong). First of all, presentation of the cake was a downer. It was a pecan flavoured cake and the top of the cake didn't have any decorations. When I brought it home, the first problem I noticed was the candles were having trouble sinking into the cake. Secondly, the knife couldn't even cut through this thick massive rock. When I was able to cut a slice, I did the first taste test. Although it didn't taste spoiled, it tasted like an old cake that was redressed. Kind of like what happened at Loblaws not too long ago, where they would redress old cakes that couldn't be sold.Eventually I didn't even bother taking it up with the owner because my initial impression while walking into the bakery felt sketchy. I was glad Metro was opened 24/7.This bakery gives Brampton a bad reputable. This bakery better step it up and actually care for t
1080;This is the worst McDonald's in the entire GTA. Ordered 2 Mcflurries at 11:37pm through the self serve machine while the store was empty. Took them until 11:55pm to take my order. Didn't get my mcflurries until 12:07am. Then my friend ordered at 11:31 through the self serve machine and didn't get his order until 12:21am. While he was walking back to our seat, the manager had the nerve to tell us to leave because it closes at 12am. WE COULDVE FINISHED OUR FOOD BEFORE 12 AM IF WE GOT OUR ORDER ON TIME. WAITED 30 MINUTES FOR 2 MCFLURRIES IN AN EMPTY 'RESTURANT' AND MY FRIEND WAITED AN HOUR. FIRE THEM ALL. GET NEW MANAGEMENT.
1081;Worst McDonalds ever. So very slow. Milkshake machine is perpetually broken. It's just close to work so it's ideal for coffee runs. Wish there were more options everybody liked.
1082;This is the worst McDonald's in Brampton I have been to this location many times because it's convenient and left unsatisfied pretty much every time today we went into try to get a fillet O fish and they tell us they have no fillets other times I have gone to get a mc flurry and they haven't had them I advise  no one eat here Boycot this McDonald's
1083;This is the worst McDonald's in Brampton bar none lmfao! The wait is always soooooo long, and in the summer they never had ice cream when I wanted ice cream. I ordered food many times later at night, always was super old. Like we got cold cheeseburgers! Old filet of fish that was like rock hard! Stale hard nuggets.. They always mess up orders! During the day: going into the restaurant.. I've only had a mcflurry. It tasted like a mcflurry!Ugh! And in the morning, they can't even get a coffee order right! I dont ever drink sugar in my coffee, what are you thinking McDonald's???I'm obviously the dumb one, who keeps giving them another chance LOL
1084;Pizza is good at this place but the guy in the counter needs training on customer service.  He comes off rude, hardly smiles and makes you feel like you are an inconvenience to him.
1085;We live around the corner from this place, and have to say the walk in special is pretty good, but then any fresh pizza tastes good.They mostly sell slices, that are all horrible, they are all dry and have hardly any cheese.Even worse, the staff treats customers like they are disturbing them. So, unless you are ordering something right out of the oven (the walk in special) avoid this place.
1086;Bd location, avoid it, we stopped eating in when the waitress spilled gravy on me, and we have the misfortune of being close enough that they are our delivery store.They screwed up the last 2 orders (forgot the gravy, then the Greek Salad) from now on I'll order pizza.
1087;I absolutely despise this location whether it is drive through, pick up or delivery. My order is never right, they are super slow and they don't care when they screw up. Out of the three ways to get food here, I think sitting and eating is the best option, however the amount of children screaming and crying inside makes me cringe. The drive through and delivery is always aggravating. My order has NEVER been right when I order swiss chalet. When I order Harvey's in the drive thru I have no issues (both drive thrus are the same place). Since they are already taking 10-15 minutes to get me my order for the drive thru window, why not take an extra minute or two to make sure it's right..it's not that hard esp if I'm the only person in the drive thru. I always have to double check my order, park and than go inside to get it fixed where I have to wait in line again. I REALLY HATE THIS LOCATION!
1088;World's slowest Swiss Chalet. They orders are never correct or on time. Even if you call ahead or order online it's still late. Then food some times looks like it's been tossed around.
1089;Ordered take out the other day. I'm not a huge Swiss chalet fan but it's nearby. I ordered the kids chicken tenders and they were so hard and full of batter. It definitely wasn't fresh. I had their apple pie and it was so cold and all broken up. The perogies made up for the meal but won't be getting anything from here anytime soon. Their drive thru is ridiculously long so might as well call ahead or order delivery to save yourself some gas.
1090;Worst over the phone experience. I called and placed and order for 2 half chicken dinners. I called back less then 2 minutes later just to change one of the side and was on hold for over 15 min. By the time I go though to someone they said they couldn't do anything because the order had already left the store. I was out on hold again and waited another 10 min for them to call the driver. Long story short, I'm very upset with the service.
1091;So true World's slowest Swiss Chalet. They orders are never correct or on time. small portions and overpriced. .. Then food some times looks like it's been tossed around looks more like a jail meal and it's even a insult for the jail food..
1092;I eat Swiss c weekly and this location refused to give me 2 salad dressings with my $13 salad!! I'm never going to be returning here again!what a joke
1093;the service was horrible we after we placed our order the food came, I am not sure if it was because we were using a coupon the waiter stop attending to us or something she never once came back around to check on our food or a drinks nothing. Once our meals were done she never brought wet naps or anything to clean out hands nothing. She came around to ask if we wanted deserts once we said no she dropped the bill and then never came back. About 10 mins went by I ask to speak the manager even the manager has such an attitude and treated myself and friend with much disrespect with me having an issue with the service. The manager said it's company policy as a customer I to ask for wet naps or napkins to wipe our hands that not longer just give you the stuff to clean your hand's  Long story short don't go to this location if you want a restaurant with good service.
1094;Found a baby roach in the bathroom. Food is cheap. They may be understaffed because Thali dishes looked like they were over the garbage for a while. I haven't been in 5 years, it has gone downhill since
1095;This place used to be decent before the new management. The food in buffet setting was not warm and everything tasted below par. By the time nan arrived already not so warm food was cold by then. I used to go their quite often but not any more. P.S. I had horrible time in the toilet next morning.
1096;Hopeless food!  I fell sick in my stomach whole eating itself.  Ordered a non veg thali. At 5 bucks it's really cheap.  But by the end of the meal,  I feel like I should have been paid 5 bucks.  I couldn't go through with it.
1097;Bought a veggie sub before a Jays game and when I got into the stadium I discovered they gave me chicken. Pretty pathetic getting an order that wrong. I wouldn't trust buying from them again.
1098;Disgusting. It's a franchise and they can't care less about the quality, appearance of food.. Brrr. Fountain drink was cold, therefore at least 1 star
1099;So I've been living in the Yonge and Eglinton area for about two years now. When I first moved in, I ordered a pizza from Gino's and was extremely disappointed by the quality. I figured maybe they were having an off night, so I didn't write them off completely.Last night I finally decided to give them another shot, and the quality was just as bad (if not worse).I ordered a large pie with bacon, sausage, onions, tomato, and mushroom. When I arrived to pick it up, it wasn't ready - which is fine I'm happy to wait a bit if it means I get a fresh pizza. (I should note that the interior of the store is actually pretty filthy and gross. Don't they ever clean up in there?)So I get the pizza home and excitedly take the first bite. It's terrible. The cheese and toppings are mediocre at best, but the real issue here is the sauce. Or the lack of sauce, I should say. There's so little on the pizza that it's basically non-existent. (This is the same issue I had the first time I ordered.)It's hard to imagine somet
1100;This is my first and hopefully last negative review. Bought a wagjag coupon for a $10 xl pizza with 4 toppings, thought it was a great deal. Couldn't call ahead and pre-order so I had to go there wait and pick it up, no big deal.When I went in and presented my coupon, the owner said: "you know I make no money off these things" and proceeded to rant to me about how I should support local business and throw away the coupon and purchase regular priced items instead. This guilt trip did not work on me and instead I just told him that there was no obligation to promote his business through wagjag, and all I did was want the item I paid wagjag for. End result, definitely shorted me on toppings and quality as a result of the coupon. I'll never give this location business again, totally unreasonable management.
1101;We ordered wings here through uberEATS. Onion rings were burnt. We ordered 1/2 pound of sweet and spicy Thai wings and 1/2 pound of Forty Creek Whiskey wings. They were terrible. Scrawny wings with barely any meat that were completely burnt. Barely any sauce. Immensely disappointing. When we tried calling the location they took no accountability saying they were unable to help as we ordered through uberEATS. Like they had no clue how to find the order. Even though we could provide them with the time the order was placed, the order number and the ITEMS ordered. I've lodged a complaint with uberEATS as well, but the terrible quality comes from this location. We will never order wings from here again. Don't waste your money here.
1102;The new location on the south side of Lawrence uses the "design" being rolled out everywhere. The result is way too loud. All hard surfaces means you cannot hear the person across from you. After 10 years, our regular Friday night crowd won't be coming here much more.:-(
1103;They changed their ribs recently to absolute garbage. I think they bought the $5 crap from the supermarket and are selling it for 5 times that.  This without a mention because they use to sell decent quality.
1104;I came here for my mother's birthday and was extremely disappointed.  I have been to many swiss chalets, I have even worked at one and tonight was the worst time I've ever had at a Swiss chalet. Our server  had 1 table in her section when we arrived and had a max of 4 tables for the night. Our server was never around, I felt she was hiding from the guests she was only seen when food was coming out of the kitchen. We needed refills but she was neglecting our table. The whole table finished there drinks and was not even offered a single refill by any staff Nor were we given water. We also were not given any water with lemon to wash our hands at all.   Majority of our party ordered ribs and was disappointed with not even a alcohol wipe to clean our hands. We were asked if we wanted the bill and responded yes and waited 15 minutes before asking another server to get the bill for us. My expectations were high as this is restaurant just opened. This is definitely not a great start for this location. Unfortunately t
1105;Ordered a 1/2 chicken combo with back ribs #10 combo. The sign in the store clearly states Combos INCLUDE pop or water. The hag there argued with me because my $27 combo didn't include a drink even though it's literally on the menu board in the store!Too bad I'm just another number.
1106;My wife and I had a very unsatisfying experience today. We had gone to the new location on the south side of Lawrence thinking we would have a great meal and service as all Swiss Chalet locations are known for. The place was not busy, because it was late lunchtime. I thought ... wonderful, we can get our lunch quickly. The manager was preoccupied with a staff member, but realized and acknowledged we were present and awaiting to be seated. But from my observation, I had a sneaky suspicion that there was inadequate staff. There was no one tending to customers at the front entrance.She had directed us to a location in the restaurant that had comfortable booths to sit in, but was obstructed by a wall with a tiny opening. She had promised that a server would tend to us as soon as possible. It was situated at the very back wall where it is difficult to see us and easy to forget. My wife and I had already decided what to order. I had the coupon for $12.99 double leg dinner, and my wife wanted to order a rotisserie
1107;By far the WORST experience and most poor customer service I have EVER seen. I actually left a really nice review before this 1 year ago, that I now deleted because this was so bad it made me disregard the entire thing. I dont know if they switched owners or something when they moved but FIRST OF ALL the "manager" or so the person who said they were in charge tonight. If I could swear on this review I would say alot worse things than how he is the biggest most disgusting jerk ive ever spoken to. First of all we made our order at 8:18pm, but didnt get our order for an hour and 24 mins. We got our food and let me tell you this was not worth the $41. All our food was cold and rolls were rock hard. So we gave them a call because this is ridiculous. The main customer service office said that the store manager said all we could get was $10 dollars off our order but considering I could have found better food at a mall food court that was not good enough. So we asked to speak to this "store manager" where he kept tel
1108;I just picked up a family pack for dinner and when I opened the food at home, the chicken was obviously overcooked. The wings were completely black and inedible, the dark meat was hard on the outside. I was close to making the trek back to return the meal but the family was hungry and didn't want to wait. Now anyone looking at the chicken could tell it was way overdone and someone had to cut it up and packed it in the container. If their staff is so uncaring about quality, what does that say about the restaurant?
1109;I remember when I was a kid, every so often I would go to a Lick's restaurant with my family.  The whole experience was great, employees were very live, cheerful and singing while making your order...it was very entertaining.  As the years past, more and more locations started to close which made me a bit sad because that was one of the few places I went to that reminds me of my childhood. Fast forward to last weekend...I was in the area and I was looking for a place to eat. I couldn't narrow it down to one location, but when I saw Lick's I thought I'd give it a shot for nostalgic reasons. In a way, I wanted to relive my experience that I had when I used to go to Lick's as a child. As soon as I entered, the place was near empty (during 5pm on a Saturday with only one person seated and two employees working). I figured I would still give it a shot since I'm here for the food as well.  The cashier that took my order seemed very displeased to be there - very far from welcoming. After I placed my order, I obser
1110;This place has gone downhill big time.Overpriced for what you get.Spent $12 on a combo, got about 6 onion rings and a burger which was pretty cold, it didn't even melt the cheese it was put directly on top of.Friend got a chili poutine and drink, came up to $9.50, huge rip-off.Do not go here if you want a good burger.
1111;Employee behind counter not very pleasant most of the time.  Doesn't change gloves after handling money.  Ewww.  Probably won't be back.  Have to tell friends about that.  It's a red flag for me.
1112;Horrible pizza place for having it twice in their name its definitely not good pizza will never choose pizza pizza again
1113;Ordered dinner from here a few weeks ago and i was shocked at how bland a pizza could taste. We ordere pepperoni pizza, dipping sauce, chicken wings and drinks. My husband said the wings were average tasting but we could not get over how bad the pizza tasted. We chose to go with the cheaper pizza place and were highly disappointed. Next time i will def spend more $ to get dominoes pizza or pizza hut.
1114;Absolute garbage service. Ordered a pizza at around 1 am since I was hungry and thid location was still open. An hour later it was still not here. I call them and they say no order at my address is listed on their record. So I order another one. It came within 37 minutes. 3 minutes more and I would have demanded it for free (they did give a time guarantee though). So I got my pizza which I ordered at 1 am, at around 2:45 am. And the pizza itself had barely any onions though I ordered onions on it, and was bland as hell.DO NOT ORDER HERE. FIND ANOTHER PIZZA PLACE. IT SUCKS.
1115;Absolute worst customer service experience ever. Ordered over the phone, order was not there when went to pick-up for a business lunch. Pizza pizza had called to confirm (1 time but was later told that they called 3 times and I was lying) but I missed the call. We arrived at the location 1 minute after I missed the call.Then proceeded to spend my entire lunch on the phone complaining to customer service, only to be told it was my fault and I should pay more attention next time. A supervisor called back an hour later, very pleasant, and gave me a credit.This culminated in me trying to use the credit today, and was told that no credit existed and I was lying about the call from the supervisor.I WILL NEVER EAT AT PIZZA PIZZA AGAIN. I have also told my colleagues who do lunch orderings and they will not order from Pizza Pizza again.
1116;Garbage pizza, tastes like cardboard.  Worst franchise in Toronto.  But the Asian cashier was very nice and friendly.
1117;I had a very bad experience from this store. I placed an order online for pick up. It was a panzerotti and while placing the order and about to check out I was informed to get a free dipping sauce, after everything I came to the store for pick up and then as I was about to receive the panzerotti, a man or one of the staff asked me for a code to get my free sauce, without the code I can't get my sauce. I didn't have a code cause it showed straight to my order that I will get it. It's included. The staff didn't care about my explanation, actually I didn't mind if I won't get the free sauce I just can't believe how that staff treated me, with that experience I called the office of pizza pizza and complain they said that I don't even have to show a code to get the free item. This store is so bad. The staff even said "I can't just give away everything in my store." I just can't believe how could he talk to his customer like that? Since then I didn't come to this store no more. No wonder the store was so empty. THE
1118;Pizza Pizza is hands down the worst pizza chain in all of the city. The quality of the ingredients is very bad and the taste of the pizza reminds you of why they are so cheap and affordable. Do yourself a favor spend a few bucks more and get a pizza that's actually worth eating. Like pizza Nova, which in my opinion is the best pizza chain or even pizzaville, at least they have a stone oven and their toppings and sauce is unique tasting.
1119;Cardboard-pizza but cheap, though the taste may have slightly improved in recent years... still quite bad. Not sure why they advertise as Ontarios #1 pizza.A while ago, we drove by this store to happily redeem the promotion for a free slice of pizza when Raptors won and scored over 100 pts... the employees denied knowledge of this promotion so I said no problem just call their headquarters to confirm while showing them my ticket stub since after all, we parked here for a free slice. After wasting much of my time by them discussing this back and forth with each other, they shook their head and said never heard it and nothing they can do, without having calling head office. Would have bought a slice since its cheap but I was just annoyed beyond belief at that point and left to eat Mr Congee.Skip this location if you want good service.
1120;This shop should be closed and the deposit not returned.  Poorly run and customer service is non existent.  The male manager returns from his smoke break and does not wash his hands before starting to make his next pizza.  If you want ash and we'll smoked pizza then this is your location. Otherwise keep driving or try the food court downstairs.
1121;The pizza was alright no extreme complaints but it wasn't that great for compliments.This place was horrible in terms of service. It was awful the way they treated us. A group of four or so went there after school and as students we have a lot of stuff. We went to put our stuff on a table and sat there for less than 2 minutes while we decided what to order. My friends had coupons so we proceeded to the register. The lady then started yelling at us saying that we can't sit there and that this was a business so we can't use the tables. After that we showed her coupons and she spent 5 minutes reading three sentences and forced us to pay tax since the coupon only said that the food was for free but we have to pay tax. The coupon was a buy one get one free. The lady there looked pissed off. Overall the experience was terrible. NEVER GOING BACK. Next time I'm going to the McDonald's or Tim Hortons downstairs in the food court by the library.
1122;I ordered a 2pc combo and he punched in 3. This is the only Popeye's I've seen that does not allow substitutions for side and drink. Well, he'd give both if I buy them separately (gravy and water). Really?!
1123;Super rude employees. Please don't go here. Whenever I visited, I feel like I'm begging for their foods. Everything here from food to service is below the standard. I wish I could give 0 star.
1124;I feel that places that are on University campuses strong arm the students that go to them, and sadly exactly that can be said about this Popeyes location. Being located on YorkU's Campus, they are one of the few "eatable" food offerings on campus. Having said that the staff is quite rude and lack any sort of customer service skills. I get that they get really busy, but that isn't an excuse to be rude to your customers (the same people who keep you in business). Customer service aside, the quality of the food served here is pretty bad and not up to the subpar level I expect from other Popeyes locations. If there is a day I don't get an upset stomach after eating food from here, it has been a good day! If you ever find yourself on YorkU's campus, do yourself a BIG favour and don't go here.
1125;My biggest pet peeve when it comes to burritos, especially those that are pressed down on a grill, is an interior that's both hot and cold. It's a jarring and completely avoidable scenario that thankfully has become fairly rare in this post-Burrito Boyz landscape.Enter Juan Gonzalez Taqueria.I arrived on a Tuesday at around lunchtime and the place was mostly empty. I decided to go with the carnitas burrito and asked for everything included and requested extra spice. (The latter provoked the cashier to tell me they don't include any hot sauce in their burritos but that I can add my own. A weird choice on their part but whatever, I guess.)I received the burrito a few minutes later and was pleasantly surprised to discover it comes with a handful of nachos and an impressively spicy salsa verde for dipping. I took one bite of the burrito, though, and felt an instant case of buyer's remorse.It's bad. As you may have guessed from my opening sentence, the meat-and-beans half of the burrito was hot and the oth
1126;avoid this place at at all cost!!! all cost i tell you!!!even juan avoids this place!!i'm going to keep it pretty simple, walked in with my gf waited 40 minutes after they messed up our order only to find out when we got home i bit in to my burrito it had a large piece of plastic in it!!look just avoid this place not worth the headache.don't be the unlucky juan eating from here!!!plastic!! she rolled the burrito with plastic in it!!I made this yelp account only to make this review, not a picky dude but this is ridiculous.
1127;Where do I start.Juan Gonzalez Taqueria is an affront to taco joints in the city. I haven't been to a Taco bell in about 20 years but I am fairly sure there would be more flavour in their horrid attempt at an Al Pastor taco than the pathetic plate that was served up to me at this place.At 3.99 per taco you might think it would be a damn fine taco. My Al Pastor taco was a pathetic mess of 60% overcooked pork that was seasoned with something that added no flavour, 10% pineapple that wasn't very ripe, 20% diced onion, and 10% cilantro.The ONLY redeeming feature was the bottled Horchata, which has a cinnamon stick inside the bottle to really bring out that flavour.If you want decent tacos, consider a walk to Kensington Market or further east along Queen. Definitely not recommended.
1128;I went to the one in Yorkdale Mall. I brought for my daughter the Sesame Chicken. The last thing in them waa chicken, it was just friend dough balls, just disgusting. Needless to say, never going back
1129;Rotten food!!!! Why waste my time with giving a rewrite because we all know it's not good but sometimes the kids crave noodles. I took one bite of the pork and knew it was rotten. I notified the staff and they didn't do anything about it.
1130;Stopped my Manchu Wok for the first time.  Absolutely the worse Chinese food I have every eaten in 56 years.The black pepper chicken did not have any meat in it whatsoever.  It consisted of big sticks of celery and mushrooms.  Portion size was not small but VERY SMALL.  Entries were 1 ounce with about 4 ounces of fried rice.The mixed vegetables were  like the black peppered chicken.  It contained 80% celery sticks. All food was so greasy that the entire bottom container of each entrée and fried rice was covered with oil when I finished the meal (if you call it a meal).They use heavily saturated oils so you actually will make a healthier choice by sticking with the burger and fries.I paid $7 for celery sticks and greasy fried rice.  Hopefully this company will go bankrupt and save a lot of people from getting food poisoning.
1131;The worst order ever. Food arrived 1 hour and 15 minutes after I ordered it. The food was cold, over cooked and oily. I used to like Popeyes Chicken, no longer. Left a bad taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet at 50.00 bucks.
1132;Absolutely disgusting. Food was undercooked to the point of being cold, wet, soggy. I had to re-cook everything when I got home to make sure I didn't get sick. Got about 1/4 of the items I ordered, which took 1 hour of waiting. Paid for $40 worth of food, got about $20. Completely left out some items, gave me others out of carelessness. If I could give lower than 1 star, I would. This location is a terrible Popeyes.
1133;Unfortunately this place has fallen off completely with the new Indian workers.  They no longer make your chicken fresh to order and everything is now soggy since they just leave it under the heat lamp all day.  It was perfect when they first opened but it is now like your average ghetto Popeyes.  It is unbelievably greasy and soggy now.  When they first opened with the Filipino workers there it was perfectly dry and crispy on the outside and moist in the middle. Too bad.
1134;Bad. Just bad. Just go somewhere else. You'll be a lot happier you did.Poor service, quality and attitude. This is a management problem as the employees reflect their decisions.
1135;OMG Horrible, I mean I have come to expect to have to check every order that I order at any Popeyes, they are notorious for giving away other people's orders or screwing yours up completely. Forgetting fries, gravy, endless.Well this time the gravy was literally ice cold, nobody bothered to turn the machine on. The chicken was truly greasy and awful, tasted like it had been sitting there for days.
1136;A restaurant (Popeyes) agreed to give refund but has not. Still have Just Eat charge. Food was running 30 minutes late. Called resto, they said 5 more minutes.30 minutes later, food still later.Finally delivered, I was about to open bag in front of delivery boy to check food. He rushed me before I could, and told me it had everything inside of it. I believed him.Went back to my apartment, opened bag. Wrong order. Not enough food.At this point had to leave to catch a flight.I call the resto and their manager. He at first argues with me and says I am wrong.  Says he wil, get back to me. Makes me wait half an hour. Finally I call back. He says that yeah, order is wrong, and he had given us the wrong order.He agrees to refund me the money.Believe him. Check a few days later, charge is still in place. He lies yet again. Worst experience on Just Eat that I have ever had. Do not order from here. They are unprepared and WILL get your order wrong and be late. There are tons of other restaurants, and 
1137;Smells like sewage when I walked in, maybe they had a sewage back up with all the rain we had. Chicken sandwich had two slices of both ends of a tomatoe. Did not eat them. See pic posted. Slow service, felt like I was inconveniencing the staff.  I was the only customer in the store.
1138;I should have checked the reviews but I got off a long fight and for some reason was craving a burger. Well needless to say the reviews are right.  This place basically just is serving McDonald's or bk burgers on a crappy bun. 16 bucks for a burger and fries would be happy to pay that if it was goodBut good news is a walburgers is opening right across the hall. I've had there burgers in Dorchester when I lived down there and they weren't bad so hopefully there will be a better burger soon
1139;Cold bun, cold burger, for 20 bucks. Next time I'll just pick something out of the garbage and save myself from the rude service.
1140;In America these people wouldn't even be feeding the dogs. Disgusting, not to mention rude "employees", dirty tables and a 20 minute wait just because they have no clue how to run a FAST food joint. Seriously airport management, you award a food slot to these people?!? April fools every day at this place!
1141;Worst burger ever. Worst service. Ordered burger with toppings. Received burger missing toppings but free hair included. Staff would not give anew burger or refund. Offered missing toppings in ketchup cups for self assembly. Do yourself a favor and don't come here.
1142;Should've read the reviews before. Hands down the worst cheeseburger I've ever had. So bad it made me feel bad enough to write my first yelp review! Dry over-cooked tasteless meat, angry looking staff, and horrible bun. Not worth a cent.
1143;Worst service ever ! Very rude bar tender.  Burgers are not worth the price. Only decent food was sweet potato fries
1144;Rude,  slow,  misleading (once you pay you find out they're out of coke),  and serving people who sit at the bar out of order.... Worst burger ever,  and hopefully they'll give this prestigious  place to someone who wants to do an honest business.
1145;Wish there was a -5 star, better off.. I wish I would have yelped this place before. I won't even feed my dogs with these burgers. Industrial meet, grey color and smelly. Don't blame it on the fact that it is airport food. If they cook the burgers while you wait, there is no reason to use frozen poor quality patties. Yuk
1146;Worst burger ever!  The previous poster who commented about the steamed beef patty wasn't kidding, it was just about the worst burger I've had, I'd rather have had eaten at McDonalds!
1147;I thought I would try out cheese bacon dog, tell me that does not sound awesome?!?!? Somehow they managed to wreck it, terrible.
1148;Worst burger I ever had to suffer through: while the price is more than enough for 2 Burger King combos, the quality is a lot worse- it actually feels like fresh out of microwave that the whole thing is very unevenly heated: some parts are warm, some are hot, and the buns are below room temperature...I guess I just became their target customer today: stranded at the airport due to delay/cancellation, too hungry and too exhausted to walk a bit further to notice there is a Tim Horton around the corner
1149;This is a pretty solid 2 star joint, but my experience was less than one star. I'm going to come across a bit like an asshole beer snob, but hear me out.In between connecting flights, I thought I would kill some time by ordering a beer.  I checked out what they had on tap, fairly crummy mainstream brews (I like craft beer myself)  except for an IPA... so I ordered that.  Both of the waitstaff advised me not to order it and told me to order a Bass instead.  It was all a bit confusing, but I wanted to try the local IPA, perhaps this was a very hoppy one and some people unaccustomed to that didn't like it.  Against the advice of the waitstaff I ordered the IPA.   I got a glass of beer, took a few sips and realized that it was not an IPA, craft beer or any type of non-commercial beer.  It wasn't a bad IPA, or a weak IPA, it simply was not an IPA, and not what I had ordered.  After being  ignored for a few minutes I flagged down the waitress.  I asked if I had gotten the IPA, she said yes.  I was friendly and
1150;Food is mediocre. Quality is wildly inconsistent. Burgers are often overcooked since the person working the grill doesn't pay attention. They can't even figure out basics like where people ordering should wait vs those waiting for their food. Worst of all, the guy preparing the burgers with toppings was also touching raw meat, and he did not wash his hands in between. One star for being able to drink on the 'patio.'
1151;An hour line to order... Oh, don't get me wrong, this place is not packed at all, they are just slow.
1152;OMG I need to puke now!!!If you wanted to burn money come here. If you wanted to figure out how cardboard taste like come here. If you're depressed and want to know how a life ending experience feel like eat here. For all other reason please stay away.  Thank you. Don't come again.
1153;If I could give zero stars I would....the fries were actually good, but the burger.....probably the worst burger I have ever had, or damn near close to the worse.  And the staff is not very helpful or friendly.Eat somewhere else......wish I had.
1154;Took forever for my breakfast wrap, literally 20 mjns!!! WTH? The lady working the register was so rude, if she were my employee I would fire her IMMEDIATELY. She didn't even apologize for the long wait.  It wasn't as if they were busy or anything. Ugh hate poor service if you hate your job go get another one.  And she gave me ONE pouch of ketchup for a whole wrap. What an idiot. They deserve  0 star.
1155;Can I rate something 0 stars?Just awful, and over priced - even for airport food.Burgers were dry, tasteless, and felt like microwaved, boiled meat. The cheese was congealed, the lettuce limp, and the toppings wrong. Add in miserable service, a rude bartender, and music so loud you couldn't hear the person taking your order.That may be one of the worst meals I have ever experienced.
1156;If i could leave zero stars i would--place is terrible. The burgers are clearly frozen, and it doesnt even look like real meat. Absolutely horrible. Fries were good, but how can you mess up fries?  Avoid this place!
1157;Waited 25 minutes for a burger combo.  The workers need to go through customer service training, and they need to get more staff in the kitchen.
1158;(Why can't I select 0 stars?!) If it is possible to be more stressed out ordering a burger than being frisked by U.S customs, something is very wrong. Let me save you some trouble. If you are wandering in Pearson airport in the near region of gate F66 and thinking of giving this place a try- DON'T. No organization, no regard for time, no respect for patrons, no apparent management in effect, no-good burger, no way do you get my money again. We were several people waiting to be served when they started closing up shop literally on us (their gate scraped my boot). Then we order and are treated to a show as we wait: staff fighting in plain sight. The main culprit was yelling incessantly at a cashier. She bore the name tag Satnam, but it might as well have read Satan (and the gate next door F666) as far as I'm concerned. Other staff members were putting away the drinks in the vending machine and putting up tables with people waiting to be served. And the grill- empty. We had to shout our orders (over the 
1159;Do Not Eat here.  Don't, you'll regret it as we did. I don't care how long the lines are, which might make you believe this is a good place, It's Not. The food was horrible and somewhat expensive. If you must stand in a long line, then go to Tim Horton's right next door (see photo).The burger was sooo over cooked I thought I was in the UK (Sorry)!  The foot long hot dog was unimaginable at best. Their bacon & cheese came with a folded piece of Velveeta and one slice of burnt bacon. Ugh!  Don't!  My stomach was regurgitating on our entire trip to Dublin, et cetera.  The old UK Wimpy was miles better than this place and that's saying something. Yelp friends, don't let other Yelp friends eat here!
1160;Very weak burger.  Institutional grade meat, cooked nice and gray just like a school cafeteria. Poutine was passable.  Move along.
1161;I can't believe I just paid $10 for that pathetic excuse for a plain burger. Save your money and go to A&W. I've had much better burgers at concessions. This is not by any means a gourmet burger experience. Buns were stale. My wife had to take her chicken burger back because it was cold. Fries were decent.
1162;Horrible customer service, refused to give extra packets of ketchup because "you already have one in your bag." Needless to say we will not be returning anytime soon. You do not give a customer attitude, you deal with theirs, I hope the extremely rude woman that took our order gets fired. What is more frustrating is that after waiting in line for half an hour, they did not have any coca cola and they also got our order wrong. It was definitely not worth the wait.
1163;Terrible dry card board burger, eggy/spongey bun..absolutely disgusting..the burger patty resembles the type of McDonalds burger that would get rejected from quality control ..Never again
1164;One of the worst burgers I had in a while. I would take McDonald any day over this place. Meat smelled bad, overcooked, and tasted lime card board. Buns are horrible too.
1165;Bad food is forgivable, bad beer is forgivable but bad service on top of it all... this place is a total fail. There are plenty of options in the airport... skip this and eat out of a trashcan if you must. I can't promise much better food but at least the service will be better.Top Tip: If you really want to try this place stand by the trashcan as many will be throwing away half eaten burgers...
1166;This place is horrible,  I havent had a burger this bad in a long time.  The service was rude enough and the food is tasteless and quite pricey. I think the mushrooms came out of a can.
1167;Service no kind at all...sits unconfortable and the burger is not special...just meat with bread.without any piece of salad...the bartender blonde girl seems under LSD and she s slow also when you have to pay...do i have to loose my flight! Terrible! No way buddies! Right name is FAKE BURGER... Also in the meantime i was sitting there right and left customer near me complain about all..never seen a place like this
1168;Terrible. Waited in line for nearly 10 min, gluten free bun advertised on the menu. I get up to the counter and the girl tells me they don't have anything gluten free. I ask what their burgers are made of, she says 100% beef, so I ask how there could be gluten in them. She accuses me of having attitude and tells me there's nothing for me to eat and the gluten free bun is just on there by mistake. Disgusted by their behaviour and horrible service.
1169;Honestly I'm shocked that the woman and the guy behind the counter were allowed to work there unsupervised. It was the wild wild west when it came to making an order, they would take orders from people who chased them down to give them their order.  I watched a few people walk away because of this which I followed suit. 13 dollar burger that comes out of a warming oven and fries are were extra.  They did me a favor and went next door and got Tim Hortons.  Coffee, sandwich, soup and donut.  10$.
1170;I guess you really get what you expect when you go to a burger joint in an airport and order a double cheeseburger and poutine.The problem was of the burgers taste like they have been done in the steamer and then really warmed up or just straight up cooked in the steamer. There was no char or flame flavor.The poutine gravy was barely edible and the cheese was terrible.  You're better off saving your money and buying a package of beef jerky for the flight.
1171;Zero stars. Over-priced, slow service, awful food. I couldn't tell which was colder, my burger or the employees working here. What a miserable experience.
1172;True burger Co serves the absolute worst burger I've ever had in my life. I think they microwaved the frozen patty a day before them kept in warm in a steaming tray for 15 hrs before flopping it on the grill for 30 seconds and giving it to me. It took 20 minutes for my girlfriend and my meal to come and cost $55. The meat didn't even taste like hamburger, it was closer to cat food. If you're smart enough to check Yelp before going to a place in the airport don't go here.
1173;Spending time in an airport isn't exactly fun. Lounges and restaurants can help but they're usually overpriced for what it is you actually get. Well on Friday I found myself in Pearson with two hours to kill before my flight and needed something to eat. There's really nothing of note as most of places sell the same things. Check it out if you don't believe me. For the most part they all sell the same things at the same prices. So enter True Burger.What can I say that's positive about them? Not much. It will keep you from starving assuming you're able to choke it down. And that's really about it.For the price I was paying, and from the name of the place, I was expecting some freshly ground burger that was expertly grilled and served with my choice of toppings. It was served with my choice of toppings so they got that part right. But they charge for just about everything including things like tomatoes and pickles which are typically free with any other burger. No here, you pay an extra $.25 cents per "premi
1174;Horrible food, overpriced, bad attitude service, understaffed, low quality food. Avoid.
1175;The best frozen burger I have ever tasted. It minded me of the burgers I use to get at high school dinners and that just cost 1 pound ! They should have shot gun and ski mask cos there robbing Ba&@$/ ! The best thing was the fries and the staff where having a laugh ! I will not be going back here again even if it was free !
1176;If yelp would let me, I would give zero stars. There was nothing positive about my experience here. Let's be honest the only reason I was here is because I had little choice. Two burgers two fries two beers, $60!  That's almost forgivable as we are at an airport. The problem is that the food is TERRIBLE!  The burger tastes like dry cardboard, it's chilled and was obviously microwaved or just warmed up and not cooked. The service was slow. Lines around the corner and one person taking orders! We ordered a beer and the keg was not styled so it was just pure head. It took the cashier at least 2 min to pour a beer which does not sound bad except there are 15 people waiting in line! After we got out "food" the bartender got in an altercation with a patron as there are certain seats that are for alcohol drinkers only, and even though there is 6 people for 25 seats, service was still refused without an alcohol order. If you can please don't ever even look in the direction of this burger hell hole.
1177;Went here yesterday! Tried to order 8pcs chicken spicy, Cashier asked the line cook how long and they said 9 minutes I told them I'm willing to wait but someone comes outside and told me if I can do Half Spicy Half Regular I said its fine I'm willing to wait but he insist and told me its bigger pieces and and I said Okay I'll take it! And when I went home 3 pcs hot and new and the remaining were OLD!!!!!
1178;Please do not go here. Food is unsanitary as they serve nor even warm, but cold/old chicken. I worked at popeyes before and they are supposed to discard chicken that are not to standards anymore but they still serve the food. I have given them far too many chances but every single time they still do it. Love popeyes but this place is def on my not to go list. Customer service is yet another horror story!
1179;Don't think of ordering out or dining in here. You WILL be disappointed, not sure how they still manage to be in business. Without the elderly population who frequents this place occasionally because they live in the area, this place would have been closed years ago. Poor service, UNBELIEVABLY POOR FOOD (if you can even call it that). Save your money, time and mental wellbeing.
1180;Came here on my 2 year anniversary with my boyfriend. Hoping it would be a special dinner, but as soon as we were seated, no servers came to us for about 15 mins and the restaurant wasn't even busy. I had to get up and get someones attention for them to finally come to our table and take our order. We ordered dinner and it came COLD. Was very disappointed considering it was supposed to be a special dinner and probably wont dine here again.
1181;Our waiter had the worst greasy comb over ever! That, at least, was good for a chuckle. Nothing else was.The first mistake was the water that my wife specifically requested with no ice. Within two minutes there's a glass of ice with a little water in it.We ordered the calamari for an app. My wife wanted the meatloaf. I ordered the cheeseburger with applewood smoked bacon, with the couscous as the side, since I'm not a huge cole slaw fan. Before the calamari was anywhere near the table there's the cole slaw I didn't want. Our waiter is obviously a little scatterbrained.The calamari was quite good, perfectly cooked and a generous portion.The meatloaf and mash with gravy was decent.My burger was very nicely presented. It actually looked a lot like the picture in the menu. Except for the beef patty. Nowhere on the menu does it actually say what size the patty is, but it does show clearly as a single thick patty. What came was two patties that were thinner than those on a McDonalds cheapo burger, and nowhere 
1182;Dirty silverwareFruit flies buzzing No musicDead! Disappointing vs. The Yorkdale outlet.
1183;Worst Pickle Barrel location ever. Service is extremely slow. We've been sitting here waiting for our server to come to us for 15mins but she's standing at the bar chatting with another server. Antonio the manager did absolutely nothing about this. They also ran out of food items too. Antonio, as a manager you should apologize for your staff not being prompt with service.
1184;This is probably one of the worst Pickle Barrel I have ever been to. I give it 1 star for the so-so food. The service still diminishes it back to 1 star.Food isn't the best, sometimes doesn't taste very fresh. When I came here the first few times with friends and family, I had thought that maybe we were just unlucky for bad service and food.I was wrong, I have given this place multiple chances. There was one time where we had terrible services, unattended. When we asked for help or to take an order, the waitress would ignore us and just say 'later'. We tried a few times and got the same response. So we just simply got fed up after a while of waiting and decided to get the bill.When we got the bill, obviously we did not leave any generous tip, because of the poor service. She asked 'was the service not good', and we said yes the service was not good, they took forever to take our order, the food came cold, they don't come and check if everything is ok after they bring their food. Sometimes they forget 
1185;Hair in the pasta made my son loose his appetite. Then we ordered tiramisu but there were no lady fingers included with the dessert. Why prepare something if you don't have the right ingredients?Dinner was shared with 10 fruit flys buzzing around us. Yuck! No wonder the restaurant has a  rating of two stars.We used to come here as kids, but now we regret bringing our kids here.
1186;Wow!,  dinner was pitifully lousy!!  Do not order the Cobb salad!  They do not know how to make it correctly!!  Missing bacon, missing hard boiled  egg, tasteless dressing, Swiss cheese Instead of blue cheese!!  HORRID!!  And it wasn't even busy!! Service was terribly slow!!   This place has gone progressively downhill!!  Avoid at all cost!!!!  Forced to give 1 star!!
1187;We used to dine at this location on a regular basis we even knew all the wait staff's names.  Food was good, portions were huge, prices were reasonable. That was before.  Now, the food has gone down hill drastically, prices are considerably higher for much lower quality food.  A real shame :(
1188;Terrible service.  Terrible food. Terrible manager.  Ordered 8oz steak.  Returned it as it was not m.r.   Next one came raw.  Mgr came out and actually argued with me. Thanks for reminding me why I don't come here anymore.
1189;I have been coming to this restaurant and location for many years.The customer service have gone down hill tremendously. I originally thought it was a one off situation but it's now a continuous thing. I can guarantee if I come to the pickle barrel I will receive the worst customer service of my life with the constant excuse of " sorry we are understaffed" I'm sorry hire more STAFF. It's obvious to see no one cares about the customer when the " manager stands around talking and chit chatting as well as staff when people are waiting to be seated. Servers do not know what customer service is .... our server came up piped there head in and said I'll be with you in a minute " not a hello how are you, my apologies you have been waiting for me to come by for 10 minutes. " I can't see this location being around much longer with their horrendous customer service, enough is enough. I will definitely think twice before stepping foot into this location.
1190;The price is not worth the quality and service. The calamari came out soggy and the plate was half full. The server, who probably was a busboy, came out with the plate and said "yo did you order calamari? I'm just going to put it here cause you don't have room in the middle of the table". The new menus looks great, but none of the food looks like the pictures on the menu. Never coming back.
1191;I have NEVER had a good experience at ANY of the pickle barrel restaurants. People who are giving them anything above a 1 star ratings either don't get to eat out much or have no taste buds and no sense of smell. AFter a few consistently bad experiences , I have made an effort to actively avoid this establishment.
1192;Santa Fe was plain and the waiter suggested to be the best. Never came back to check upon us. We had to go to the counter to pay.
1193;We placed our order with Just-Eat at 5:40pm, knowing that delivery started at 6:00pm. We expected our food to arrive around 7:00pm. The restaurant called us around 6:15 to confirm an item on our order, so we know that they at least had the order at that point.We called the restaurant to check on the status of our order at 7:00pm, and they notified us that the driver had picked up the food and was on his way. We are located only a 17 minute drive from the restaurant. We called again at 7:30pm to follow up on the status of the order, and they once again assured us that the food was on its way. At 7:55pm, we still had not received our food and called again. We were especially concerned that our food was prepared before 7:00pm and would be cold by the time it was delivered. The delivery finally arrived at 8:00pm, and to no surprise, it was cold. We would not have ordered from Pickle Barrel if we had known it would take 2 and a half hours to get our food, or even if we had known that our food would sit in 
1194;Too bad there is no option for zero star!Dirty restaurant with fruit flies and flies around our table, dirty Windows, our chairs were dirty.Came for dinner, lots of empty seats but service was still slow.  I haven't been here to this location in 20 years and now I remember why. Over priced food, dirty dirty dirty. Will not return.
1195;Ordered  take out. All downhill  from here. Waited almost an hour  for 2 salads. Finally got a beverage at the bar while waiting for 25 minutes for the take out person to tell the bartender we would like a virgin ceasar while we wait. Got our drink when the salads  were ready. Sitting down to eat these yummy looking  salads at home when we come to realize the crunchy spinach salad had spoiled bacon on it and it was quite obvious by the foul smell. I lost my appetite  and returned both salads and requested a new  fresh crunchy spinach salad. I also asked the manager to look into  the spoiled food issue and he said ok. I got home again and realized that this salad was spoiled as well. I had to to go back and return it amd request that the manager  smell the salad. He agreed it was spoiled. Why would he guarantee me the second salad is fresh  when it wasn't? Overall the service is pretty lousy because the staff is too busy doing nothing and wasting customers  time. I did  receive a full refund and an apology,  h
1196;Was at this location tonight for a friend's 30th birthday dinner.  We had about 30 people in the party so we expected that service might be a tad slow but understandable.I was one of the first to get my order in and the very last to get served.Ordered steak and eggs (one of the simplest things on the menu). They got it wrong... TWICE!!! Wanted Steak done rare. Both times it came Medium-Well...Ordered Eggs over easy. The first time they got it right but the second time they came sunny-side up...  ARE THEY EVEN PAYING ATTENTION?!?The server asked if I wanted a menu to get something else because he figured the 3rd attempt wouldn't be any better, but it had been over an hour since I asked for the steak and eggs and I was very hungry at this point.  I couldn't trust them to make anything else considering that couldn't even make a rare steak and eggs over easy.Went to McD's instead where I could trust they would get my order correct and in a timely manner.
1197;We had a worst service and worst food, we order 2 fish and chips which there was no taste of fish and stake wasnt done how we asked.Our server was a old man and we had no idea what is he saying all the time so basically zero satisfaction from pickle barrel .Nice familly area but service below expectation, very poor.Been contacted with the customer service lady but no respond from the manager so i guess they don't care about the reviews.
1198;This place has the worse service ever!  The wait staff have apparently worked there for 30 years, and do not have a personality.  Your food is served to you like you are at an army canteen, and the food itself is overcooked and is cold when you get it.  They even get your order wrong!  The greet staff look like high school drop outs that couldn't care less about you, and the bus boys act like they would rather be doing something else.  The best part about the place is that you can laugh at the ridiculousness of how this place is run and the people they have hired.
1199;3* for average deli style food and negative 5* for the nasty service at the take out counter.  A simple question had to go around in circles of rapidly aggravating communication - my question - do you have a fucking side of coleslaw and if so, how fucking much is it? Over that, I just about leaped across the counter and strangled the snotty little shit giving me attitude over a simple question that he seemed incapable of either understanding or answering. I don't need the aggravation over borderline mediocre food.
1200;Ouch... terrible.From order to food on table was 1hr. When food arrived it was missing half the ingredients (no mushrooms/onions). When I asked about it they brought out the sides - we were almost done our meal!Really nice environment... but never coming back again.
1201;This is the place to go when you don't want your server to talk to you or go even near you. My breakfast had hamburger buns instead of actual toast. Then the server didn't come to check up on us until later where we needed the bill...
1202;This review is personal, because DAMMIT I HATE RICH KIDS!I attended the junior high just acrossed the street from the Pickel Barrel Plaza, and never did I have money to buy their poutine like the other cool kids during lunch.  So I always used to ask for a fry, and even ate what some of the other kids couldn't finish.  That box poutine was like six dollars man!  Everyday I looked at those smug kids chewing on their poutine arrogantly with spite...Then you know, ten years later I forgotten about this place, until I needed to get lunch.  I was like, damn....I'm going to that pickle barrel and eatting the s%*t out of that place.  I ordered angel hair pasta with mussels, a whole bunch of other side dishes.  Basically the most expensive things I ordered them all.  I munched it down with pure hatred, and my friend looked at me not knowing what was going on, thinking I went completely bonkers.  This was without a doubt, the most passionate lunch of my life.The place was always dimly lit, even in the window 
1203;Disgusting customer service from both the manager at the restaurant, as well as from head office.  The restaurant manager sends a condescending insulting so called apology email, and head office sends a disgustingly insulting "form letter" not even addressing the original complaints over a month after the initial complaint was put in.As a former customs of over 40 years, I would strongly consider choosing another restaurant who has more respect and appreciation for their long term clientAre you surprised that the flagship location only got 2/5 stars here.?! I'm not..!I will never set foot back in that restaurant again!!
1204;The jerk staff always mess up the order, I asked for spicy chicken and they load it with sweet and sour sauce...I ask for large fries they give me small. Worst most dumbest ppl on earth live in this area....double check ur order...take a bite infront of them to make sure they don't mess with the proper ingrediance....to hell with this BK location I hope they hire less retarded staff who follow direction and don't mess with orders for the fun of it.
1205;This week is McDonald's free small coffee promo. This is the first McDonald's I've been to that they rip off the free coffee stickers and I'd assume it's because of the promo because if it's an actual ongoing thing.... guess that's what you get when it's a bunch of immature teenagers working here. Apart from that I agree with the others in terms of service it absolutely sucks and by the time your food comes fries are cold.
1206;Worst McDonald's location ever. The food took forever to come staff forgets about ur order the line up is crazy long amd it's slow staff too busy knowing each other's dumb gossip and hair colors. Worst service don't bother The manager here was a joke too.
1207;This mcdonalds like the one at St. Clair and dufferin is a pit hole.They take way to long with the food. They can be heard fighting with each other. Staff on their cell phones.Food coming out like crap Not a great place they drop the ball here
1208;If you dream of visiting a tiny McDonalds packed to the rafters with homeless people and greasy weirdos than this is your nirvana. Its tiny too so its jammed packed making comfortable movement difficult. I feel for the staff who struggle to serve the endless line up of freaks that stretches at times right out the door. Yikes. I don't care how big the hangover is or how hungry I am Im not going back in there.
1209;Had their roast beef sub for lunch and got a terrible upset stomach. Either it was undercooked or it wasn't stored adequately for a hot day. It sucks because I was really excited to find this place.
1210;Good food, but bad service. They have so much special offers advertised in th store and in the flyers, and when you ask for it they say we dont have it! "Sorry its not there!" Well if its not there then why would you offer it! They put it to trick customer! Its so eligible!
1211;I gave this place 1 star because 0 was not an option. Horrible service, dirty, and terrible food. I found a bug in my food and the staff didn't see any problem. They acted as if I was lucky to receive a free protein. STAY AWAY! You're better off eating from the dumpster out back.
1212;Water on the floor and not being swept. They ask for your order and forget about it.. They look at you and ask again, then still not prepare it. Let u pay.. Then another person stares at u and asks you what u want again! Food is ok.. But pricey for the quality and location. No presentation at all
1213;Had to repeat a simple order, two times at the drive thru speaker and another time at the window and then they forgot my drink. Had to go to the store to get it , but had to wait in line, while I was in a hurry. Several times I had to hang on to the card swiper because they forgot to take it from me.
1214;Worst managed KFC I've ever been to. Consistently very long waits for service and to receive food. Line ups everywhere, even in off-peak times. This outlet has s in dire need of competent management!
1215;Two or three years ago I wouldn't have had any trouble giving this location 4 or 5 stars.  The serving size has gone down yet the price goes up.  Try not to get there too early for lunch as you'll get yestersday's leftovers.  I usually get the bourbon rice, bourbon chicken & mixed veggies.  I gave them another chance last week after not going for a few months & the quality/quantity is still not worth it.
1216;WORM. Stopped at the new Eaton Center location, blasted through my lunch, about 80% done when I found a crushed, dead worm about an inch long. Almost barfed. Emailed their head office twice, no response, Called twice, no response. Tasty food though, WHEN THERE ISN'T A BLOODY WORM IN IT.
1217;My girlfriend and I went there on A Thursday afternoon and we received TERRIBLE customer service - the cashier barely spoke to us, kinda just grunted and pointed at things, extremely rude- several items listed on the menu were not available - Stacks of filthy dishes right on the counter in front of register - mediocre food but severely over priced (buffalo sauce was so "vinegary" we couldn't eat it) - all of our food was stuffed in one paper bag that was ripped apart by the time we got home- and lastly the overall cleanliness of the restaurant was very poor!
1218;I came here with my friend because I saw it on a show a year back or so and it was a let down. The guy at the counter was uninterested in serving customers and he didn't even clean the table until I asked for cleaning supplies.  The food was bland at best. They don't use fresh ingredients and the milkshake was a joke. The chocolate milkshake consists of NESQUICK and MILK....so why did I pay $5 for it????? The pineapple on my burger was canned!!! My friend ordered the Sloppy KO and it was not sloppy at all !!! I was I didn't come here NEVER AGAIN!
1219;I rarely write reviews for restaurants but I feel like anybody wanting to go here should get a fair warning.After passing by ko burger multiple times on my way home my girlfriend and I decided to try this place one day. I wanted a chocolate milkshake and ended up getting what tasted like water mixed with chocolate milk. One sip and I wanted to throw the thing in the garbage. The burger was chewy and bland and didn't taste quite right. We didn't even finish the food. I was completely unimpressed with this place and suggest people thinking about trying it to save your money and go around the corner to the mcdonalds. Even one of their dollar menu burgers taste better than this crap. I think it's pretty obvious but I will not be returning to this place! If I could give it a negative star review I would.
1220;Great $5 lunch special however cleanliness is evidently not on managements top priority. Place honestly smelt like a bathroom but the burger was good. I'd suggest take out.
1221;Probably the worst burger joint in the city. The burger's texture is like rubber. It is VERY expensive for such bad quality. Customer service was god awful, and the wait time was ridiculously long. They were playing some good music and the graffiti logo on the wall is pretty cool.
1222;ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. Only gets one star because there isn't a no-star option. Ordered delivery from these guys and the driver was an hour and a half late, with nothing to say for himself but "it was busy". All the food was stone cold. When I called the restaurant to tell them what happened, they offered me a discount for my next order, which I guess seemed reasonable to them but WHY WOULD I ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN? Even if the food was hot, it would be mediocre at best. Never giving this place my custom again.
1223;After getting turned away from Square Boy - because I tried to pay with my debit card and they're cash only...who knew? - by the time I got to Broadview Stn. I was starving so I thought I'd try this place, since it's been in my hood for years now and I've never been.While the price impressed me, the food didn't. I got a burger, sm fries and sm onion rings. The burger was, as many others have pointed out, DRY and there isn't much to it. If you're looking for one of those big, fat, voluptuous home burgers, don't look here because you'd be out of luck. It was not only dry, but it was small, rather tasteless and FLAT. Yep. Flat! Like someone took a burger and dropped a ten-pound weight on it.While the fries and rings get points for not being greasy, they could have used a little more flavor. Square Boy wanted to charge me $12.00 for what I got at Ko Burger which was only $7.00 but the big difference? Square Boy's food is better....a lot better!!Next time I'll make sure I've got cash.
1224;New Owner ????If it ain't broke don't try to fix itYou had perfect recipes but you have chosen not to use themThis is the worst delivery meal I've ever encountered. I live 5 minutes up the road.The fries were 2 hours old and cold.The Burgers I think we're from lunch also stone cold and rubbery .I wouldn't even give my dogs left overs because I don't know as of yet if I'm going to get food poisening but I am going to put a sample in the fridge just in caseBe prepared for a health department visit One Star is over rated
1225;I actually got yelp because of my experience here. Went there last night and it will be the last time.  To be honest I could of went to McDonald's and been more satisfied with my meal. The service was sub part to put it nicely the burger was dry( I got the flaming ko), the toppings were non-existent (I would of thought they mixed up order but the place was empty) onion rings were too greasy. Extreme burger is 10 times better!
1226;Life lesson!!!!! Don't order lunch from someone who looks like they just rolled out of bed.Atmosphere, place has a moldy smell when you walk in. Service, there isn't any.Food, I couldn't even finish my burger.Attendant, slow and lost in his own world.What else can I say......don't bother.
1227;When FatCat buy something from dollar store and it breakdown, FatCat thinking "no problem, FatCat only pay one dollar and expect cheap thing to break soon."But when FatCat pay premium for burger, FatCat expect some quality. Unfortunately for FatCat he not get what he pay for at KO burger.Things FatCat like - Some unique combinations of toppings you not get anywhere else (doritos on burger - not too big deal, but something nice).Things FatCat not like - Quality of beef - FatCat thinking K.O using frozen beef patties for meat?  Not sure, but that's what it taste like to FatCat.
1228;I paid an absurd amount for dozen crappy little reheated wings. I don't mind paying decent money for wings if they are fresh, but these were reheated junk that had no flavour. Staff was typical, no acknowledgment of you as a customer, they are just there to take your money and get you out the door. Place wasn't very clean or inviting either.
1229;The staff are hit or miss. One or two of the guys are nice, the rest seem to absolutely hate it there. I (used to) grab slices from here because I live close and it's cheap, but I found every second time I did, I got really Ill afterwords.  I can only speak for the veggie or cheese slices, but if THATS giving me food poisoning, I'd be really afraid of touching any meat product here. Something is wrong with the food in this place.  You're also surrounded by mirrors inside, and I often find myself looking into them asking myself what fuck I'm doing eating there again.
1230;Never again.I paid 30 bucks for the Wings and Ribs Combo.  The wings were undercooked and almost felt raw, and the ribs tasted like they were boiled.  I could only muster up the strength to eat 5 wings, and then the disappointment took over and forced me to put the crappy food aside.If you ever find me considering eating from this place again....please cut my fingers off.Im so pissed right now.I hate WIng Machine.
1231;This chain has dropped in quality so badly in the last 20 years.  It used to be not so long ago that you'd get really good food from Wing Machine.  The last time I ordered last year, I got a horridly dried out meal.  I put the experience aside.  Today I tried again and ordered a half chicken dinner, and three drumsticks hoping the last experience was isolated.  Nope.To be blunt, I've seen fresher stuff unwrapped from the pyramids of Giza.  It was cold on arrival, totally dessicated, and the "dinner" was pressed flat to fit in a pizza box.  The drumsticks didn't even look as good as something excavated from Giza.  They were obviously found in the Sahara, spiced to death and dropped in a box.  Two strikes, they're out.Not sure if other stores in the chain are better but this is what the Bloor & Dufferin store are trying to pass off as edible food.  Save yourself the money, eat the menu.
1232;Not fit for dog foodI was SHOCKED at how bad these wings were.  These were the WORST wings I've probably EVER had in my entire life.  90% of the wing was HARD AS BONE - and I was able to pull about 5% of the flesh off to try to eat that.  Words really can't describe how terrible the wings were.   They were dry as the desert and hard as rock.  Oh - and cold.  (I'm glad I didn't order more than I did because I tried to order the deal that was listed on the front of the flyer that I have - but the order desk said they'd never heard of such a discount - false advertising.)The ribs were disappointing.  Fries and garlic bread were OK.I guess my first warning of bad food was when the delivery guy shows up and he is probably well over 300 lbs.  I get the impression he prepared the food - and I also bet he hasn't taken any pride in ANYTHING he's produced in years.$58 bucks wasted.   Thanks Wing Garbage
1233;I had walked by this place so many times before I decided to finally try it. I'm sorry to say, but considering this is a "wing" place, it sucks at making wings. They're small, hard, not flavourful, and expensive for what you get.  I'm so surprised that this place is still around. It looks like an old pizza joint on the inside. It's dark and the sign looks dated too. I've heard that this place serves better pizza than they do wings, but I didn't come for pizza, I came for wings!
1234;Awful. I will never go here again. I was here with two friends for dinner. We opted to try something else other than Momiji and boy did I regret it. The service was terrible. We waited forever for our food, and two of us only had one item delivered. After waiting forever, it turns out they forgot to make my dinner, and my friend's. The sushi I did get was mediocre. Lastly, they tried to charge me for a roll I didn't order. Between the horrific wait, the food screw up and the bill errors, I will never come back here again. I'd rather spend a bit more and get good sushi and good service across the street at Momiji. Having worked in the service industry before, I've never left a restaurant without leaving a tip in my life. I just broke that rule here. Do NOT go here EVER. Crappy sushi, and the servers are clueless.
1235;I would give this place zero stars if I could. The service we received here was atrocious. The lady that works here is rude and unwelcoming. No hello, no smile, just literally dropped cutlery we requested in front of us and disappeared. I am never returning again and for sure don't recommend this place to anyone.
1236;Please DO NOT order from this Dominos. The manager is NOT helpful and Janet is rude and knows NOTHING about customer service.What happened? I wanted to redeem the coupon of 2 large pizzas and 2 large cokes for $10. They DID NOT tell me that chicken is considered to be 2 toppings. With a lot of back and forth with the location, all the manager could say is you can return the pizza. We kept the pizza and paid double the price.Go for Pizzaolo - it's wayyy more worth it.
1237;I ordered a medium pepperoni and mushroom pizza online for take away. I drove over, paid and saw once I got home that they forgot the pepperoni. When I called the best thing they said they could do was give me two free toppings next time. So annoying. I won't be ordering from them again.
1238;so i live literally around the corner from this dominoes and this is where we have to order from. On 2 occasions these place just straight up F**KED with us.First issue: The first time we tried to order from there they would not answer the phone. So we called another locaton who proceeded to call them. We were told to try to call sherbourne again. We did and still they did not answer. We called back the second location and after they called sherbourne again the second location had no choice but to deliver to us because sherbourne did not want to.second issue: We place our order, literally (and im not even exaggerating) not even 5 mins later realized we could have got a better deal with garlic bread added so i called right away. The guy proceeded to tell me it was too late to add it to my order because the delivery guy was already on his way to my house......i questioned the fact that it does not take 5 mins to cook a large pizza. He then told me it takes 7-10 mins and that i made my order earlier then i t
1239;Probably the worst Dominos location I've ever ordered from.Entered my address on the website and it entered as a completely different address about two blocks away. This wasn't a big deal because the driver called and apologized for getting it wrong, asked for the new address, and said he'd be at the new location. Hour passed and he never showed up. Called the store and the manager claims the driver delivered the pizza. After a big of a struggle, the driver, talking to the manager, throws me under the bus too and claims we put the wrong address down (it said the correct address on the receipt email we got). Got fed up with the bs and hung up the phone, no pizza at 1 am.
1240;This place is absolutely horrible. We ordered a pepperoni feast pizza and there was barely any pepperoni on the thing! The pizza was also way too salty and the crust was so soft. Ugh!
1241;Man, this location is kinda in the middle of nowhere. Luckily it was here though, or I would have gone hungry before a concert!A tiny store, with no sort of organization whatsoever. Walked in with about 10 other people waiting, scattered around the counter. Couldn't tell if they were waiting for pickup or ordering. The cashier made no effort to assist customers coming in either, so there was quite a bit of just standing around. When we finally ordered, we didn't get a receipt, didn't take our name down for the pizza, and didn't give us our drinks. We had to ask her afterwards to give us our drinks, which she kinda just confusingly gave us. When our pizza was ready, they didn't have any names down, so she they didn't even know who to give it to. I just ended taking it and leaving. All in all, not a good location, with confusion and disorganization throughout. I won't be back unless I end up in the same predicament...
1242;Avoid this establishment and their delivery service at all times! Their delivery car parks constantly on the bike lane (462 Sherbourne Street). This business is endangering everyone on the street. I don't want to imagine how serious they take food safety if they act like this on the road.
1243;I meant to write a review about this place last week. We ordered 2 med pizzas and dipping sauce. Usually the pizza is good from here and we enjoy it. What turned me off of them this time was that when the ordered came i asked for the bill. The driver said it is on the box. a sticker is your bill. I said that is not a bill it just says the total of the purchase. I want the itemized bill. I want to see what you missed on my order. How can I complain about not getting something if you don't give me a bill to prove that I ordered it. Plus when i payed the driver $40 bucks he shot me a dirty look when i asked for change. ( i was going to tip him after i got the money back)  I need to call head office about this.
1244;Today I ordered a pizza there, with no cheese because I'm lactose intolerant. They made it rather quickly, but there were a few concerning things about this particular establishment. The staff began yelling in their native tongues at each other while I was waiting, which made me incredibly uncomfortable during the 10 minute wait for my pizza, which I had sadly paid for before receiving, so that escaping the unprofessional, noisy establishment without getting ripped off was impossible. Someone was also making horking noises while they were making my pizza, which freaked me out and made me wonder if they were spitting in the food? There was only one table inside, and a bench, so it's not really a dine-in place. Despite my fears and all of the strange things they were saying, I decided to brave it and eat some of the pizza. The mushrooms weren't the freshest, and I definitely won't bother coming back to this dive-in pizza joint ever again. If you have to get some Dominoes, I recommend ordering ahead of tim
1245;This is the last time I order from here. My reasons are the following: -thin crust pizza arrived cold and 15 minutes later than the time indicated in the email after I placed my online order-driver kept coughing which kind of grossed me out. He is handling my food after all.-in addition to the delivery charge, which is almost $4, they have the gall to charge $1.50 extra for paying by debit.  This was not mentioned anywhere online. How convenient.... spring the charge on the customer at the last minute. -The debit machine didn't even work and I had to run inside and hold it near the window to get a signal. Well, that didn't work and a reboot of machine was required. Took several more minutes. Pizza is getting cold... -I was so annoyed by the debit charge that I deducted it from my usual tip and left $1. This has become my policy for all companies which charge a debit fee. Clearly Dominos and I are not a match and I'll be sticking to Panago next time I want a hot pizza and no debit charge. The have  whol
1246;I ordered the bbq chicken pizza and specifically asked for no bacon as I don't eat bacon. I only noticed it had bacon after my first slice, couldn't continue my pizza. Such a disappointment! Ruined my meal and wasted my money.
1247;We only ever order from here because it's convenient, but I'm done with them now. The last two times we ordered, the asshole driver said we didn't give him our buzzer code, even though we did. He was incredibly rude about it both times, too. The second time I actually took a picture of the screen when I was filling out the online order form to prove it to him. After he left, I looked at the pizza box and saw that my buzzer number was printed on the label so I guess he's just stupid on top of rude.On top of the general dickishness, he forgot the 2 litres of coke we ordered, so he went back to the store to get it and we had to wait half an hour for him to come back. (This place is only about a block and a half from my apartment. I could have walked there and back in a fraction of the time.) We called the manager and he was also rude, raising his voice to my husband. We ended up getting the coke for free, so we got to have that with our cold pizza, but that's not good enough. This particular Domino's lost a cu
1248;We stayed at the Sheraton Parkway next door.  Stopped by to buy donut and milk for the kids. Donut was very good.  Bought 4 bottles of milk .  Opened 1 and noticed 3 out of 4 were out of date. Returned the milk and NOTIFIED the cashiers.  Came back the next day and they sold us the same 3 out of dated milk even the one that I opened on the previous day.  Coffee was bland and lukewarm.
1249;Get a receipt for everything you buy and make sure all the items are on your tray before you sit down. The staff seem nice enough, it's probably just bad training and bad habits.
1250;Unbelievably, this is the last Tim Hortons in Toronto without wifi!Location is usually packed during the day with seniors. Drive through is reasonable.
1251;Wtf? Is it normal to not be able to order a large coffee in an extra large cup so that we could add some ice in it to cool it down? My husband starts to say he will pay for an extra large but wants a large in it. I say no, and I mention about people double cupping for free, she lets us have a small cup of ice.What was the purpose of this? Is she/are they trying to save money? Because I feel that the option she gave us was actually costlier in the end.Honestly I think there was something up her ass the entire time. Before we ordered, an old man nicely handed her the food tray and she tells him to put it in top of the garbage instead. And she kept eyeing him as he did it.Tues. Nov. 3, 3:15pm.
1252;Gave up on this location! The staff are sooo slow and constantly mess up orders.
1253;Will concur with the first review. Wanted to like Ginos because the one in Malton is awesome especially it's slices which are nice and crispy and uber tasty. I ordered the pep, mush and gr pepp pizza  here and what I got looked quite promising but failed to deliver big time. The ingredients were all there in good quantity, all reasonably baked in, but the taste was bland and yucky from the start. The crust was light-crispy and nice, but the sauce was plain disgusting, the green peppers a few weeks old and slimy (though nicely cut up) and the entire thing just a mediocre pizza misadventure you'd come to expect from those old style conveyor ovens (note: mind you, I've had some awesome pizzas from those like Reginos, but mostly crappeola from those style of ovens). I kid you not when I say that a frozen pizza would not taste any different from what I received on this day. I felt the servers were nice, but -despite their close attention to my pizza, which was partly due to lack of customers - their pizza  sucks b
1254;Careful ordering a beer here near last call... May come with unexpected side of attitude
1255;Rude barstaff, drunk customers, great for the regulars not so good for anyone else. The liquor board should shut this place down, they don't seem to realize there are serving laws in this province and when a drunken regular starts arguing with a sober patron it's the barstaffs job to remove the drunk from the premises regardless of how good of a friend they are. It's unfortunate places like this are able to fly under the radar. I guess we'll have to wait till one of these patron kills someone with their vehicle before something is done. Be careful when driving near this place, it might be you.
1256;No food available at 2:30am. Staff decided to clean washroom for 30 mins and would not allow access when I had to go to the washroom in an emergency(weak bladder). Not returning.
1257;They make the icecaps fast and runny, doughnuts are good obviously coz they put it in the bag. Also, there are always these Middle eastern or Italian old men that are either sitting inside or standing outside smoking and they keep staring at you or catcall you or follow you inside before you enter. I stopped going there because it made me uncomfortable. I do not know if they are from the hasty market next to it or not.
1258;Takes too long to wait inside in the line. Looks like drive through is a priority for them( more people working on it.
1259;25 minute wait in the drive-thru!! This place is SO disorganized and short staffed. Not worth the time.
1260;Of all the KFC locations in the area, this is the one with the most issues.Avoid the drive-thru.... you'll never leave with your correct entire orderAvoid asking for the Colonel Specials as they have no idea about the insider dealsDon't let them take your credit card to swipe the interac/credit machine.... my credit got cloned here and what a mess to fix up.
1261;I used to enjoy kfc in my country. I come to this place and I can say it is the worst food place I have been in Toronto. They gave me dippems that were a joke,  not real food. They were just crispy and no chicken. Also they don't have drink dispenser. They have only 2lt bottles and not all the drinks. It is not a restaurant. It is a bad joke that I hope you never visit to or at leadt I would like this place to shut down.
1262;Incompetent staff at this KFC location seem incapable of doing takeout orders right. On my previous visit I asked for a 15 piece bucket, dark meat only, yet half the bucket was wings and breasts!  I had to complain to get the order corrected.  I ordered the same thing today plus a medium gravy. Before I left,  I asked if the gravy was included and the young woman at the counter assured me it was.  Stupid me,  I should have checked. Got home,  no gravy in the bag. I am fed up with the staff at this KFC and I  won't be back.
1263;I was in for lunch and what a shit show. The food was decent or at least what you'd expect I mean it is a gabbys. But it seems this location is different than others. It's a chain so I expect it should be consistent across the board, but my goodness the service was atrocious. Evidently there was a computer issue as paying debit was out of the question, which is fine, but the subsequent display of absolute contempt by the barmaid literally throwing the point of sale machine across the bar while yelling 'this is fucking bullshit' and subsequently slamming bottles and the bar around left most customers in shock. It seemed amusing to some so I can only assume they are regulars and are used to this kind of behaviour. At any rate while me and my lunch date were waiting while the barmaid who maybe is a day manager but is middle aged with bad highlights and glasses was either on the telephone making social calls or out smoking cigarettes. I used to work at a hotel so I know that customer service means not bringing yo
1264;Truth be told. This place is a cool looking place to hang out and chill at. It is just so sad to see how this place is run. Service is the worst ever. You could have made so much money on drinks at my table.  We had a table of 10. All of whom drinks like fishes. We even ubered there. We were there to watch the game and have a good time but they managed to screw that up too. We wanted another pitcher, went through two waitress telling us that they can't get it and would get someone else to... Are you freakin serious?!?!?! How hard is it to fill up a pitcher with beer???? They would leave us hanging go to the bar and hang out. Wow talk about being  LAZY!  If i was the owner of that place, everyone would be fired!!!! For real!! Dead serious!! Have had bad service before but this place went to another level of crap service!!! Horrible!!
1265;Another bar that will not survive. With Chain restaurants like Boston Pizza within minutes of your location that accept SPC and don't auto-charge tip, it's going to be hard competition. Underwhelming beer selection, wait staff that don't know the menu well enough and dirty cutlery...needless to say my friends and I will not be returning. Would give this place a 0 out of 5 stars if that was an option. Steer clear, lots of better options in the area.
1266;Do not go to this McDonald's and went last night with my parents and there was no organization of a line, when I finally did order I ended up waiting 10 minutes until I found out someone else got my order. I will never go back to this McDonald's or recommend this location to anyone
1267;Months before went here once, "cold" experience, cashier took our order with no smile, absolutely no consideration for customers. Big sign $1 beverage but charged original price, because she did not want to void the order, good job.
1268;hated it the stupid bitch and her manager didn't know shit didn't take my mother fuckin discount in drive thru never go here they're all dumb rats
1269;Wings are soaked in sauce, becomes slow cooked wings. Wings are pretty big, and wing night only for dine in only.
1270;First thing first: this review is for the Ajax location ONLY, other Wow Wings are very nice places.Reasons why this is a terrible restaurant:-Their menu is actually just a PHOTOCOPY of Whitby's menu, with a strip of paper with Ajax's phone number placed crookedly on top. Aside from the incredibly poor quality (things are cut off everywhere), they don't even offer all the items! I tried ordering nachos for example, but they just don't do them. -They answer the phone with "Hello?", and don't try to properly take your order at all. After asking for the single deal combo, they just said "OK"... So I had to go through telling them the flavors I wanted, type of pop etc.-When we went to pick up the order, they didn't know it came with coleslaw... Even though it's listed clearly with the combo I ordered. Waited around for them to grab that, which ended up being about 2 fork fulls of slaw.-The wings themselves are pretty good, I'll hand then that, but I made the horrible mistake of trying Gar Par fries. You know
1271;I got food poisoning twice from here. Wanted to believe it was just something else but it's most definitely their food. They either don't throw out old sauces, or don't wash their hands but this place is gross
1272;I love getting food at Villa madina. But the location at Pickering town is the worst. Food is horrible.  Dry chicken, potatoes and rice. Salads are not fresh. If you want villa madina just get it at a different location.
1273;Horrible customer service and food was garbage. Workers looked depressed, food was disgusting. I took the food back and told them that it was disgusting and the manager was arguing with me. First of all, Why would anyone waste their time on arguing with someone when the whole purpose of buying food is because they're hungry!  I said I would get something else but he refused so he gave me my money back and I was happy about that because I didn't want to eat anything from that place. Never eating there again. Pickering town center has shit food period.
1274;All I wanted was a Shawarma Sandwich with tabouli in it.  And they argued with me.  Couldn't do it.  Had to have the Shawarma plate.  Walked away.
1275;Subway is suppose to be some good, health, quick food! And this place "magically" turned those wonderful sandwiches into some poisonous food!Please get your phone ready and dialed to 911 if you are planning on eating here, or this could be an awesome place if you need a doctor note for any of your tests or assignments, good luck!
1276;Never eat here! I've gotten food-poising from their incorrect food storage and also they were offering a promotion where you pay for 10 sandwiches and you get one free but the lady said when I tried to claim my free one that the "promotion did not exist anymore!" This is horrible business practices.
1277;This is probably the worst Subway in Toronto. It even makes the TTC look good!The people working here are downright rude and mean. Not only that, but they will always screw up your order! Ask for parmesan oregano and you might just get plain white bread. Swiss and cheddar are interchangeable as well. Oh and they skimp on ingredients.Still, this place manages to stay packed all the time because of flood of new UofT students ever year who don't know of all the food options in the area.
1278;I had lunch here today. They dropped a bun on the floor and picked it up and reused it !!! euuuuh. Also, they have no customer servies experience as they talk impolitely to customers. Never going back there again!!!
1279;Pressed bread, bad cutting, place all in the middle, bad wrapping. Inconsistent in general.
1280;Had lunch here with my mom. Staff was mildly unfriendly, nothing glaring but enough to dampen the experience. I could have forgiven the service if the food had been good but it was ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. One roll in, I couldn't eat the sushi anymore so I turned to the tempura which was cold and greasy and came with the weirdest tempura sauce I have ever tasted. Everything about the meal was off, it tasted like a group of kids with poor hygiene and no kitchen skills had decided to cook lunch. The best part? Both of us had really upset stomachs within half an hour. Never again. So many better options in the neighbourhood.
1281;I should have listened to the reviews and not gone here. The first thing I noticed when I was seated that the front window was really dirty. Should have been a warning sign. Also there was no air conditioning which I found bizarre as the place has quite a few seats, it's not just a quickie take away or anything. I got the lunch AYCE for 11.99. I started with the miso soup. It was average. The yam tempura maki was made with undercooked yam. It was crunchy and not just from the tempura coating. The spicy salmon roll was gross because the salmon was obviously frozen previously and massacred in the cutting process. I also noticed the roll was warm. Not like sitting out for 30 minutes on a counter but like warmer than normal room temperature. The mackerel nigiri had very little fish. The fish was again warm. The surf clam nigiri was also warm. Seeing a pattern I pondered whether they might be lacking refrigeration as well as a/c. I'm not a food safety expert but something tells me letting raw fish sit in the sum
1282;I should have listened to the negative reviews. Went there 6 times, all for AYCE, were nice experiences except 2 times. The nice ones were when the female owner was present. She was a warm older lady, who always greets and smiles.The other positives in a nutshell: food is excellent, clean washrooms. I love their spicy mayonnaise sauce that they use for the spicy sushi/sashimi, and their fried udon. Also, their spicy chicken is to die for.Now the not-so-good, oh dear, should I say the most terrible experience I have ever encountered with a human being. The other 2 visits where I regretted coming was when there was only the younger male owner present with the staffs. There was this extremely rude asian woman, who claims to be the manager. If you come there often, she's the woman with glasses and shoulder length straight hair. First bad visit she was rude to my friend who asked whether the sushi that woman just put was the one my friend ordered. Afterwards she ranted towards the chef and the male owner in Chi
1283;BOTTOM LINE - HORRIBLE, but read on of you're interested.My entire family has been coming here since they opened years back. As of tonight, they have lost all of our business - which I might add would be several thousands annually.The restaurant has been owned by a nice Chinese couple and up until recently had done well with the business. The quality of the food has taken a slide meaning, it's hit or miss. Tonight was mediocre at best. If Jenny or her husband are in working the kitchen and sushi bar, the food is usually fantastic and well worth the price. More often than not though, the husband seems uninterested and has other people doing the sushi bar for him. Needles to say on these nights the food is absolute crap, as it was tonight.But we being a tolerant and nice bunch, can live with the hit or miss because we genuinely like the couple. Or did.Tonight's experience was a nightmare for my wife and I who were the only people in the restaurant. We arrived at 9:15pm and promptly ordered. The food beg
1284;I have been here a handful of time because it got rave reviews from an acquaintance. It worked well for a large group of friends when we dined in. As it is an All You Can Eat, we were obviously satisfied with the menu and options. Nothing extremely amazing but substantial. I ordered delivery about three times, and once got food poisoning. The sushi boat was always tasteless and nothing was fresh. I ordered takeout recently and came in about closing time. As I waited for my food, a staff member was mopping the floor with the most putrid smelling mop water I had ever smelled. It was worst than sewer, homeless funk and rotten flesh mixed together. I wondered--if they don't bother to EVER change their mop water--how clean is everything else? I hightailed it outta there and haven't returned...and won't.Go up the street for better sushi at Zen Sushi on Heddington/Eglington--3 mins away. Don't waste ur $$$
1285;The worst Tim Horton's I've ever been to. Slow, rude, and its almost routine that they will screw up your order in some way. Too bad this is the closest Tim Horton's to me.
1286;This is a terribly run Tim Horton's. It's mostly crowded with obnoxious teenagers during the lunch hour. When I have to stop in for lunch, as one of the few places close enough to work, I dread the chaos. The employees I've interacted with (mostly on cash) are also not that pleasant. I'm guessing the lunch time manager doesn't know how to handle the lunch time rush - he's pretty inept and constantly overwhelmed everytime I see him. Additionally, I'm usually a fan of Tim Horton's food - like the potato wedges. And the wedges at this location are quite possibly the stalest, chewiest pieces of garbage I've ever put in my mouth. ***AVOID THIS TIM HORTON'S AT ALL COSTS***
1287;So I have given this place plenty of time to settle in and get their shizz together before updating my review, but it still STILL is the worst Tim Hortons I know of. Today I said three times Earl Grey tea and she still went and made me a green tea. Oh, and they let someone totally and visibly cut the line and they said nothing and served him first while the rest of us waited and waited. Seriously step up your game!!!
1288;Absolutely terrible.  Don't punish yourself by eating here.  After experiencing a health code violation I will never return here.  The food preparation is sloppy, and there's dramatic variation in quality and consistency of product.  They would rather focus on rationing napkins and ketchup than be in any way concerned about your food.  The only good thing about this place is the friendly lady at the drive-through window.  This review is made after having been to the restaurant several times.  At some point, convenience just isn't worth it.
1289;Just visited this location and it's the filthiest, stinkiest restaurant I've ever walked into.  Floors / tables are filthy and it smells like a dirty bathroom.It was so gross I had to leave.  Very gross!
1290;Holy crap, this location is bad. Went in today to grab a teriyaki bowl and the worker there was crusty. August 8,2015. He did not acknowledged us nor greet any customers. The place looked like a damp , dirty tables food leftovers everywhere. Not sure if he was left alone and was pissed about it , other customers came in and he didn't even come out of the kitchen to check  on them... They ended up leaving. Found uncooked meat on the counter, wondering how long has it been there. Avoid and continue driving to the next teriyaki...
1291;I'm very disappointed with this location. This is my second experience ordering a Big Mac that came with missing patties. First time, last week, I was missing 1 patty second time, today, I was missing 2 patties. Hire better, more attentive staff!
1292;Wake me up when they start offering all day breakfast..  Considering it's the only edible thing McDonald's even makes.Also the drive through here is slow as molasses.
1293;Our order took 20 minutes. The manager said it was because of them switching from breakfast lo lunch and she didn't look like she cared anyway. My wife's breakfast wrap was cold and barely any egg. I would avoid this location as the food and service is poor.
1294;bad service, cold fries and my meal got served to someone else.the line up to buy food was insane, and the service was beyond disappointing.people were actually recording the rude interactions that the staff were projecting and when someone asked for the manager she dismissed them.
1295;FYI: they do not accept Subway coupons at this location. This is the closest Subway location to my house, yet I will never return. Their bread is not fresh. Their servers are rude. They seem to fall far below the standard one would expect from Subway.
1296;Ugh, there are good subway locations, and bad subway locations. This is one of the bad ones. In a rush, ordered a basic sandwich and and the guy serving me put toppings on that were clearly past their best before date (limp peppers, brown lettuce, etc.) Gross. You're down town, walk a couple extra blocks and hit up a different subway sandwich location.
1297;A shame as I tipped.Awkward food and gross customer service.I will NEVER be back to this location.
1298;I'm a huge Subway fan and this one is practically visible from my place of employment so it's not uncommon for me to go here twice a day despite the fact I should know better. The lettuce usually has brown pieces and the bread is usually stale. They apparently didn't get the "Eat Fresh" memo. The shredded cheese is almost never filled. There is one worker who can't speak English at even a minimal level and she will charge incorrectly every time (luckily they have all been in my favor so far but I would watch her). The other workers aren't familiar with the menu. I told the guy to add pepperoni to my sandwich and he told me it wasn't possible because that's not the recipe. I showed him the sign that says add pepperoni for $1 and told him I've ordered it all over Canada and it's been on the menu for a year. He agreed to do it and asked every other employee in the place if they knew they could do that, which they didn't. The bizarre thing being I've been adding pepperoni at that location for the last three weeks
1299;Horrible service. Staff member I dealt with was not very friendly at all. I ordered a Blizzard and basically got vanilla ice cream  in a cup. I went back to show the employee that took my order and was met with attitude. The gentleman behind the counter took my cup, threw a few more pieces of chocolate into the cup and gave it back to me instead of making me a new one. Obviously cheap owners here. There's even a sign in the store that states "cakes do not come with cutlery" or something along those lines. How cheap can you get??? Will never ever go back to that location.
1300;Rude service. They don't accept coupons and they are incredibly disrespectful to their customers. You are better off getting mcdonalds mc flurries! Steer clear of this terrible establishment.
1301;Check your order being leaving the drive thru. They forgot to pack a fork with my meal...most important utensil if your not eating a burger.
1302;If I could put a zero star I would. Ordered a double hamburger. Nothing in it just 2 dry pieces of meat. Ordered chicken nugget happy meal. I accept the fact that it was 3am. But the fries and nuggets hard like rocks and cold. Returned the food. All they did was microwave. Since when do u get mcdonalds food with steam coming from it. Manager Imraz. Un-cooperative
1303;stopped there for breakfast around 6am. Ordered a wrap but was told that they aren't ready. Recommended me to choose something else or wait for 10 minutes. I was in the drive thru and was asked to get in the line up again.  not impressive at all. Was late for work.
1304;I go to this location often. Today was my last visit.I ordered pepper chicken flatbread.  Simple. Lettuce cucumber cheese bacon and some dressing.The owner placed 3 cucumber slices. I asked for a few more and was told I would be charged extra.And then got a lecture on how a cucumber cost 1$ for all those slices as he pointed at the over flowing tub of sliced cucumberI asked how much for the cucumber and got a very cold stare down.  He then rudely placed just one more slice of cucumber on my order.  This location is going down hill fast. Last few visits were not positive..
1305;So I tried Mr. Sub yesterday. Canadian and all, I thought, why not switch a love brand (@Subway) and give the local guy a chance. I visited (3040 Danforth Ave, East York, ON M4C 1N2) and let's say I will never try Mr. Sub again. Not only that, I frown upon those who do because of my experience at this particular location (parts makes the whole). The owner/server was rude and unfriendly - not once did he smiled at the guest ordering from him. When it came my turn, he rushed the order and the worst parts has to be: 1. I ordered a 12 inch Tuna and 12 inch meatball, wanting 5 vegetables on it, and he said, "Only 3 - this is a sandwich I'm making, not a salad!". Add to this, 2. when I asked if I can have 2 particular sauces, he said, "Meatballs already have its sauces - why do you want more?" I still ordered because I believe the service might be one part, and the food, another. It ain't so. The breads are stale, the vegetables are older and limited, and above all, no free napkins - seriously? This particular "cus
1306;Another Tim Hortin's I frequent out of convenience but unfortunately probably consistently the worst I've been to. The location itself is so awkward to get into a very tiny parking lot east of Rogers on Weston rd not very far from the intersection which gets rather busy especially with the current "construction situation". This  makes entry perilous at times, the parking lot itself becomes gridlocked because of the design of the drive thru, this alone makes this location super inconvenient.But worst of all is the service here, I can't count the amount of times I've been inconvenienced enough to further inconvenience myself by going back to complain. I've received sour milk and cream here with management arguing with me that the curdled milk in my cup must be my doing somehow. Honestly Im not expecting much more then to receive what I ordered with decent service but I've never met more miserable people and it seems to only gets worse.I've heard many say to me... It's just a coffee shop but it doesn't det
1307;Just look at the pics and tell me if you will support TM.  They are all becoming dumps
1308;This Starbucks drives me nuts.First, the staff is completely incompetent.  This has been a growing theme amongst Starbucks', but they do some things that really irritate me.The staff touch their eyes, lips, face, hair and never wash their hands.  Today the girl behind the counter was picking gunk off her eyelash - didn't wash her hands.  They've had two staff members with visible lip cold sores (i.e. herpes) serving ... just, like, the peeps a day off.  The staff has major attitude as well.  I have a really weird drink order. I get it. I announce that it's weird before I launch into it.  But it's also a $6 drink.  So, for $6, I think I can ask for my drink in an odd way.  It's nothing they can't do.  But today the dude literally rolled his eyes, laughed at me, and went over to discuss it with his co-worker. WTF. What the acutal eff.Anyway, it's the closest Starbucks to my work so when it's -20, I have little to no choice if I want something from a Sbux.  But I hate it nonetheless.  Actually now I'm ju
1309;Should have been open today until 10 pm, as per its sign and per starbucks website. Was closed at 9.15 pm already. Staff waved us away. Hate this kind of unreliability. Did they get payed until 10 p.m. by starbucks anyway?
1310;I've had bad food before and usually I don't mind it too much, but this was just too crap. An absolute waste of $30. How does greek food that cost almost 3x as much as Jimmy The Greek taste 10x worse? I got a chicken souvlaki that came with barely any chicken which was rubbery and just bleh, the potatoes looked and tasted disgusting. I threw my "Greek" fries in the trash because not only were they soggy AF, it looked like someone had diarrhead all over them. My "garlic bread" was just some shitty soggy hotdog bread, I could make better garlic bread at home. My spinach rolls were soggy just as well. I have a feeling they don't make their food on the day, and they just microwave shit.If you're expecting some delicious, authentic food that tastes good, this place is fucking terrible. I mean I saw all the reviews, but I love Jimmy The Greek and they don't do delivery so I thought this would be a nice substitute. This place is just gross. Should've just went to Nando's or Jimmy. As soon as I got my food, I wen
1311;Visited the location with family, very disappointed. There was a fly in my salad!!!! I opted out for cooked veggies. When they brought those, there was a hair in the veggies!!!The chicken was super dry and very salty.To make matters worse, they still charged for the (fly) salad and the (hair) veggies on the bill!!!! Will not be going back there 100% ! Do NOT recommend!!!
1312;Mr. Greek9301 Bathurst St.Richmond Hill, ON.+1 (905) 883-1414Earlier today, I called the restaurant prior to placing my Order and advised the lady I want the red sauce on the side, she asked me to put it on the notes when placing my order with Uber eats, so I went ahead and placed the order and in the notes I stated "Please put the red sauce on the side, not on the rice and not on the potatoes. Thanks"I called the restaurant 20 mins. later and asked if the food is ready or not? The same lady said "yeah it's ready actually but I forgot to mark it ready on the Uber eats app", I said to her "well the driver will take some time to get to you and since the food was ready a while ago I'm guessing it will be cold when it gets to me", she said it will be fine.Uber delivered the food, even though I've requested NO sauce to be placed on the rice they still put the red sauce on the rice, and there was NO red sauce on the side so I didn't have sauce for the Greek fries either.The chicken tasted old and nasty, 
1313;This place has gone downhill fast.  Hard to mess up on chicken souvlaki, but they did. Rubbery chicken, al dente rice?? Pretty bad.  Used to be the place to go to.   Now there are so many better options.   Don't waste your time.
1314;This place has gone downhill over the past 6 months. We kept coming back due to the previous experiences we had from when they opened until about August. Last time I came it took 45 minutes to get take out after the employee up front told us 20 minutes. Then when we got home all of our food was not what we ordered. Fried calamari instead of grilled, got potatoes and rice instead of rice and fries like we asked, and they gave us pitas when we asked for garlic bread. The worst part is the service. I asked to speak to the manager after the food was taking so long and a man came out and gave the most condescending answers, telling us we just had to wait as long as it took, there was nothing he could or would do. When the owner is on site it is a little better, but even then he has let standards fall since they opened. I joked with one of the waitresses about how well they are reviewed on google and she said management makes them write fake reviews, makes sense now. Over all bad experiences. Never going ba
1315;Wtf. Ordered from just eats and this was so expensive. I didn't get the right order..calamari is small, pitas are flicking hotdog buns..wow..ghetto....so disappointed HOT DOG BUNS STUFFED IN A BAG...wow so Greek...I want my money back .
1316;An overall nasty experience from top to bottom:1. My wife's salad had a big hair in it.2. The pork in my pita was processed meat and tasted disgusting. 3. My food took over 20 mins to prepare, even though they had about 6-7 staff in the kitchen (although they were mostly socializing).4. The food tasted bad, not surprising, since they likely use low quality ingredients. My advice, stay away from this dump, unless you like crappy food.
1317;Negative if possible. The only thing this place has going for it are some of the decor pieces. Other than that, this place doesn't even deserve to be open. Worst experience me + 11 others have had for a birthday dinner ever. We were the ONLY table - had a FIXED menu - arrived at 9 and only got served appetizers at 940 only to wait another hour for our main course which was EXTREMELY salty. We skipped out on dessert and just wanted to get out of there. Plus I think the waiter was high on drugs when he was serving us. Flailing his arms all over the place, had a bad attitude, kept touching his greasy hair then our glasses, and just overall sketchy.Do yourself a favour and ** A V O I D  ** this place at all costs.
1318;The one star is because the food was actually quite good and most of the wait and bar staff were pleasant enough.  The steak frites were very well done  (pun not intentional) - in a large group, they still asked how we wanted our steak done, and the portions were generous.  One particular staff member was especially sympathetic to our situation, which was appreciated.  Aside from that, there is not much else that is positive to say.  A colleague of mine and myself organized a staff holiday party of approximately 50 people at Vogue Supperclub on a Thursday night.  The price and location were right, they could accommodate our group size and the venue itself had a warm and cozy feel which was perfect for our needs.  Weeks AFTER booking, we were told that another party for a beer company I won't name had been booked that would be taking place upstairs (we were in the basement), but that it would not begin until 10:30 and would not impact our group downstairs.  Clearly this second party was booked so they could 
1319;Renamed FORTY2 Supperclub .. nothing much has changed if I compare my experience to all these other negative reviews. I went to FORTY2 for a friend's birthday - possibly one of the worst nights. Bottle service was cheap for a Caribana night - $40 for entrance, booth and booze (per person). No crowd. Clearly, the club next to it was the popular one, because it actually had a line up. The little turnout was trashy - not my scene to be sliding down on the dance floor and booty shaking. I don't see why it's called a "supper club" .. The food isn't great and the place isn't upscale. The music was loud and obnoxious. They don't even have proper systems in place. Do young professionals even club anymore?If I could've given this place ZERO STARS, I would've. This place gets a 1 star for the ample free parking around it.
1320;I booked reservations here for 7:30p.m. Upon arrival I was standing there and was not greeted for almost 5 minutes. I had no idea what to do but stand there and wait. I was a little annoyed. As I was seated the menu was not available to me so I had to wait some more. Finally when I had ordered and received the food, I was very disappointed. I had the pork tender loin and my boyfriend had the steak frites. It was extremely disappointing. It was overloaded with the sweetest sauce ever and the frites were cold and soggy. When the bill came I had a dealfind voucher for $100. First, it was not a $50.00 menu as promised when it was a $40.00 menu given to me. There was also an 18% automatic gratuity on the bill. NO restaurants do that and i was so baffled especially when I tipped him $15 dollars myself not knowing tip was already on. The service was great but everything else was terrible. This restaurant has clearly shown that it's been cheating there customers and I will never come to this restaurant again. Poor
1321;No Stars for this venue and the only thing this place has going for it is the resident Saturday Night DJ (DJ Glew, you need to find another venue, other clubs deserve your talent). Safety hazard = Stairs, Washrooms = Awkwardly Small, Dirty Upholstery = Questionable Food, and the Crowd thinks they are Up Scale but really just Up Tight Posers in training. This was truly a wasted Saturday night, this club is prime example as to why people would much rather party OUTSIDE of Toronto. Real "Supperclubs" are on King West/College St.
1322;ZERO STARS (Negative If possible)My friend bought prixe-fix menu vouchers for five people on Teambuy, and we came here for dinner on the last day before the vouchers expired. However, we only had four people, so asked the waitress if we can use the $25 value on the fifth voucher towards alcohol. She said no, but when we asked to speak to the manager (who was eating at a table close to us) she said she will check with him. Well, she didn't speak to the manager for what I can see, and came back 15-minutes later, denying our request again. For a Saturday night, this place is very empty. It was just our table and another table with the owner's friends. So, I couldn't fathom why on earth it took an hour before we had any food on our table. My seafood risotto was just horrid - extremely salty. Everyone at my table tried it and agreed that it wasn't edible. I called over another waiter, and this one apologized and took the risotto away. I was expecting for the chef to remake it and waited for another hour, when 
1323;Bad service. Over priced and not worth the entrance fee. Staff are rude and unprofessional. Drinks are watered down and I will not be coming here again.
1324;I was utterly unimpressed with this place. We had our work holiday party here. We arrived at 6:30 for dinner. Apps weren't brought out until about 8:30. Mains weren't brought out until around 10. Dessert wasn't served until 11. Well, I shouldn't say dessert was served. They kind of just laid a bunch of plates around the place and told us to go get it ourselves. When the courses were being served they came out of the kitchen so slowly that some people were done before others were even served. I had some spaghetti that was dressed with only butter and  garlic. Hardly worth the price. My friend next to me ordered a well done steak. It came out rare. She asked to have it redone. It came back rare. How do you screw up something that someone has told you to intentionally over cook? Anyway, at least there was booze to get me through. Kinda. Twice I walked to the bar and stood for several minutes while the bartender had her back turned to me texting on her phone. Servers had to leave the floor and come tell her she h
1325;this isn't a sushi place. They make stuff similar to sushi or a roll but that's not sushi
1326;Went here on a night the restaurant was not busy. Did the all you can eat and more than half of the items we ordered did not arrive. When we asked the waitress where the dishes were she played stupid and acted as if it was a magic show, like they disappeared. There was zero remorse for all the dishes we didn't receive. Needless to say I will not return to this restaurant. In an area filled with plenty of all you can eat sushi establishments, I will take my business elsewhere!
1327;We always go to Ginza on Weston Road and it's to die for! We thought we'd try a different location....big mistake! Worst customer service EVER !  The menu offered way less items and the wine costs more. We are usually fab with tipping, NOT this time. This place should close down, not even sure how they've made it this far. Never again!
1328;Avoid this place at all costs! I went for dinner with my mom and the sushi and sashimi was not fresh at all. We returned most of the plates and the waitress was really nice about it but the chefs looked really pissed off. She actually got really sick later that evening.. We definitely won't be going back.
1329;I'd give it half a star if i could.I recently went with my girlfriend for dinner. Service was horrible couldn't get a refill of water without asking and when i asked it still took over 10min mind you it wasn't busy at all but that's fine. We then asked another waiter for the bill cause our waiter had completly forgotten about us and it took another 10min just to get the bill. I payed debit and didn't include tip because I was gonna put the tip in cash. The server then looked at the receipt and had to make it a point and say "you know tips not included right cause you didn't put any". Even if service is horrible which it was ill at bare minimum tip 10% but because he had to make it a point that i didn't tip him and the service was horrible i didn't tip anything. And to top it all off he got mad and said " you should show respect next time". All and all horrible experience and by the amount of 1 stars im not suprised.
1330;I wish I could give this place 0 starts. Their takeout is ok. But for dining they are horrible. Must be the worst service I've ever had. We walked in for dinner tonight and decided to go with Al la carte.  We got tea and pop to drink. We sat for 30 minutes with the menus without anyone paying attention. Paid for our pop and left. The other day we came for AYCE lunch and got served with 70%rice 30%sashimi. Very very bad restaurant. Poor quality food. Gave this place 2 chances -  no more. Don't waste your time and money. Look up Ginza on Weston road/ Langstaff much better service and quality food there.
1331;Came here for AYCE for lunch. The selection is very limited. No shrimp tempura, no beef teriyaki. The food is average. Service is non existent. I finished my tea and they never come around to refill it. Even after we ask for more tea, they never came around to refill. There are better AYCE in Woodbridge.
1332;It had been about a year since I last frequented this place and now I remember why it's been so long. We usually go to the Ginza in Thornhill, which is great! This Ginza however, is a far cry from great. We ordered from the 'All You Can Eat' Lunch menu on a Saturday. The joint was pretty busy, shocking. The wonton soup consisted of 2 raw wonton wrappers with no filling floating in what looked like water, not broth. The wontons had no filling, literally, I'm not even exaggerating in the slightest. After telling the waitress, she looked at me like there was something wrong with me. The green salad was yellow, no julienne carrot pieces, no frilly vegetable shavings, just sad looking, yellow, head lettuce with a smidge of dressing. At this point our prospects at having a decent meal was looking meek. Then came the sesame chicken, which had an off-putting texture, like they had taken yesterday's sesame chicken and deep fried it for a couple of minutes to make it look fresh. The vegetable tempura had no flavour alo
1333;Disappointed with this experience.  The all you can eat menu was very limited and prices confusing.  Would definitely not go back.
1334;Went to ginza with my boyfriend for dinner. Worst experience I have ever had at an AYCE sushi restaurant. Absolutely terrible, stay away! 22 dollars for AYCE dinner, what a rip off! The menu was the same for dinner as it is for 14 dollar lunch. I've been to some bad AYCE restaurants but this one is the worst. The food was awful too!
1335;I went to ayce lunch with some pals of mine. The waitresses were very rude. They kept me giving me dirty looks. Possibly because I am Jewish. The food was okay. But the salmon tasted very bad. I did not want to tip them cause they sucked but their was a mandatory tip. Overall the sushi tasted like pooh, waitresses were hoes and salmon was weird.
1336;If I could give this place a 0 I would. The people who work there ARE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO RUDE!!!!!!!! I WILL NEVER COME BACK. It was 15.99+taxes and food was okay. We paid and they laughed at us because no tip. And didn't say bad. Super rude. They only give u one menu that's it. Never go listen to the reviews
1337;Tried this resto for a second time. Service and food are very poor.  Found a dirty receipt in my bento box on the salad which the server did not offer to replace.  I had to ask for a new salad.  Curry Chicken was breaded, fried chicken with sauce poured on top.  That is curry chicken??  Quite disgusted and what i did eat, repeated and came up on me.  Second time is not a charm.  I will not be back or recommend this place to anyone.
1338;Be careful, incredibly TERRIBLE SERVICE and NOT FRASH FOOD. you can see from your order simply tossed to you on the table, my wife was POISONED at this restaurant. My opinion, I would close this poor Chinese canteen.
1339;I used to love this place exclusively for its sashimi but everything else they do has become all about using old ingredients to save money. Today's takeout included salmon on my dragon roll being a dark grey/brown, clearly made days ago and left to go bad
1340;One star because the food was horrible, we ordered the popular things people will order . Sashsimi had this stale taste, the Sui Mui tasted like it was from two days ago and it was good. We ordered the ribs and we got the ribs when we were almost finish eating , they brought the bill and we didn't even finish eating. Few minutes passed I for my BBQ bun which I forgot I ordered because they took s long to bring it out. The bun was soggy and tasted bad. I won't recommend going there !!!!
1341;This place is the biggest joke and the reason why I hate random sushi places such as this. Yes I know Ginza has more than one location. How? I have no idea because their customer service is a joke. Their servers are nothing more than hostile people who absolute hate their lives and show their attitude to their customers. It takes over 1 hour to get your food at this place even when it's a simple order and there are two people in the restaurant and if you even call for pickup you have to wait over 20 mins as they put you on hold while the waiters decide to gossip with each other. I have been coming to this place for years because I live so close to it. But over the last three years that quality of the fish has really gone downhill and on top of that their customer service is horrendous. What kind of ownership does this place have that they can't control the attitude and complete disregard for their customers. Seriously be warned, unless you want crap service, crap quality of sushi, questionable atmosphere an
1342;Really not happy with this place. It's nice and big and there were a few chefs there during the lunch, but the service was terrible. They did the classic move of "forgetting" part of my order. The food I did get was average at best. Definitely won't return. There's at least 5 other AYCE places I would go within a 10 min drove.
1343;We came for the buffet. They told us we can only order 10 sashimi per person. Never heard of such buffet before. It was ridiculous and I will never go there any more. Really terrible experience!
1344;Rude service, the sushi was terrible. I asked a few questions before ordering, as I was allergic to certain items. The servers were laughing and making rude comments under their breath.The sushi was almost stale and I threw it out.Waste of money compared to the other sushi places around the area. Would never return. Portions were a joke, they were selfish with ingredients.
1345;Ordered from here the other night and it was nothing but a horrible experience.First off, it took 2 hours to get our food delivered.  Not sure if the language barrier was the problem on the phone which resulted in the driver being lost but 2 hours is just unacceptable. Especially seeing as this place is rarely busy and is only two blocks from my house.We ordered the Pad Thai, Oodles of Noodles and Mango Chicken.Pad Thai:  They use really wide noodles.  As a result, the noodles were very, very dry.  This is easily the worst Pad Thai I've EVER tried.  Didn't help that I had asked for extra sauce and didn't receive any....which definitely would have helped here.Oodles of Noodles:  Really, this is just a stir fry of noodles, vegetables and whatever meat you choose.  The noodles are similar to shanghai noodles only a little closer to the size of spaghetti.  Good sized chunks of chicken but TONS of vegetables.Mango Chicken:  Chunks of breaded chicken, your typical mango chicken sauce...and lots of it.  An
1346;If I could give Thai One On (Danforth Location) 0 stars I would. I ordered food from this location last night and received it THREE hours later. I placed my order at 7:18pm and received it at 10:15pm. After waiting just over an hour for the food I called the customer service number on the Thai One on Website to ask if they could update me on where the driver was. I was told by the woman I spoke to that he had left 15 mins before and would arrive shortly. I proceeded to wait another 15mins and called back when no one arrived. The woman then proceeded to tell m that she in fact could not even see my order on her computer and I had contacted the wrong location. She gave me another phone number for another location and asked me to call them. I called the other location (located on Dundas) and a very helpful man Alex proceeded to call the Danforth location for me and get the driver/owner's cell phone number of the Danforth Location and suggested I call him. After calling the driver/owner and not reaching him
1347;Leaving behind the terrible service, let's talk about the food. The mango chicken is so sweet that they should call mango ice cream with chicken. The sauce was thick and glazy. The padthai is not very flavorful and had a strange after taste, hmmmThe so called samosas were terrible! Totally bland and hard to chew. The only good thing was the brown rice. At least it was cooked. Now back to the service, check your receipt, and do not let them haggle you! When did you ever see a haggling cashier? Weird.
1348;Never have I had such a frustrating experience with a restaurant, or food in general.Ordered $40 worth of delivery tonight, which consisted of:1. Green Curry Beef2. Lemon Grass Soup3. Curry Shrimp4. Glass noodles.The delivery time was double that advertised. All in all, we waited for an hour and a half. When the food finally came, we were all so appalled!The curry shrimp, which was $13, consisted of a measly 5-6 shrimps. And they were just the regular supermarket frozen type you can get at Nofrills, not the "tiger shrimp" as advertised.The glass noodles were clumpy and oily. The chicken was dry and tasteless. The lemon grass soup ($6.99) had a few slices of mushrooms and 4-5 shrimps. It was also unacceptably spicy. We dumped the whole thing down the drain. The curry beef was simply disgusting. For $12, we got skimpy slices of low grade beef which were overcooked. 3/4 of the food ordered simply went down the drain/garbage chute. How this restaurant manages to survive with their abominable fo
1349;For those of you pining for the threat of violence with your disposable lunch, this is the location for you! Situated in the heart of the burgeoning Fashion District, but still retaining some of Queen West's "olde-timey" local colour, this KFC/Taco Bell location at first beguiles with its anachronistic, chalet-facade (surprisingly unmarked by graffiti) and array of inexpensive offerings.  However, less than two minutes into my repast (I sat at the less-dirty of the two window tables, hoping for a quick exit), a lumbering street local bounded into the store, only to be taunted by a cohort outside.  Some pounding on the window ensued, and the lumbering one headed for the exit, frightening a woman and her toddler presumably waiting for the washroom to be vacated.  He turned at the fire exit, headed back towards me, only to be blocked by the man from outside. Swearing and pushing erupted, the smaller man landing in the chair opposite me. The larger man then returned to the fire exit, further terrifying the (still
1350;bad place to go! 15 seconds walk from my house(YES), but I DONT ever go! Just worst food ever! Bad service too, when I asked some questions about items, they were so annoyed n gave me hard time. Lst weekend when my friend came to visit me, he grabbed some quick wraps, then 20 min later he had intense stomach pain. And he was like:"I don't feel very social right now!" LOL. yes he went home right there. What the heck, was suppose to go coffee n walk around downtown. lol For that KFC sucks because it carries Taco Bell lol.
1351;How stupid can employees be?I ordered on the condition that I would get ALL legs and thighs.What do I get?  included are 2 wings and a rib.And guess what?  These intellectual midgets USUALLY CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A THIGH AND A RIB - so I USUALLY get a rib OR TWO included - and I hate white meat so much that I DO NOT EAT IT.So I call these nitwits, and I get offered ONE free piece of chicken with my next order.NOT GOOD ENOUGH.Oh, and don't let them talk you into trying their Raspberry crème pies - they are INEDIBLE.  Mine came glued to the inside of the package it was in, and when I tore the cardboard off it and put the two pieces back together and took a bite - YUCK.  I wished I hadn't bothered wasting my time.  But my dogs might eat it.  Maybe.
1352;Found a piece of hair inside my chicken then found some hard weird looking object inside my mashed potato.. disgusting please do not go here
1353;Don't go here!I got ripped off!I ordered a family meal and the man at the counter said it came with 10 fingers, but when I got home, there were only 8!  And then he asked me which 3 sauces I wanted, and when I got home there were only 2!  To top it all off, it was $4 more than buying 2 individual meals that would have included all the same things, plus my 2 missing chicken fingers and 2 drinks!They didn't provide me with the items I ordered, and I don't want that to happen to you.I strongly advise avoiding this place.
1354;Ordered from just eat and they forgot my fries and there was no biscuit!!! What the hell!!!!
1355;Good chicken - well cooked and what I expect from Popeye's... BUT - they completely forgot to put in the biscuits in my combo - huge disappointment! Also, the staff seemed completely unengaged - only one person (out of three) doing any work (both taking the order and fulfilling it). Concerned about hygiene based on the lackadaisical attitude of the staff.
1356;This is the dirties restaurant I have ever been in. I almost fell down the stairs trying to find the washroom. Once I got downstairs, I there was urine on the floor and feces  on the wall and flies everywhere. Not only did I not use the washroom, but I complained to the Management and threw my meal in the garbage after being refused a refund. I expected a lot more from Popeyes.
1357;never againnot only did they make me wait 1/2 for my order with no apology and no they weren't busythey also got the order wrong too which I didn't realize until I had gotten all the way homehow can people eat this over salty fatty crapthat is half an hour and $12 I will never see againI just threw the whole thing down the garbage chutenever again
1358;BE AWARE  Create Your Own Burger only available until 7pm!!!!I drove all the way over to try their Create Your Own Burger, which I had read is the first in Canada.  I got there at 7:15pm only to be informed that it is only available from 11am - 7pm.  So, I had to order off the standard McDonald's menu even though I told the staff that I drove a distance just to try it.  Sigh.  Bad enough they wouldn't be flexible enough to serve it that close to cut off, but the poor customer service provided when explaining that it wasn't available made it all the more disappointing.  All I could do was think of Adam Sandler in Big Daddy complaining about the breakfast cut-off time with a child having a melt down.They have kiosks for people to punch in their own order for the Create Your Own Burger, but staff were turning them off for the evening.  They also had table tents that had flip chart style pages for each of your options for the build your own burger that staff were whisking off the tables since it was after 7pm
1359;This restaurant seems to be run by clowns.   The drive through takes over 10 mins just to order and another 5 mins to pick up your food.   Service is non existent, when paying the cashier seems to only stay inside the window and wil not stretch out.  The order was wrong and when i questioned little princess had a hissy fit.  What is wrong with customer these days?  I can only imagine the service inside.  Please keep driving and get your golden arches fix elsewhere.
1360;Never go here.... ever ever.  I ate there, and got so sick for the next few days it was not close to being funny.  I think their chicken is..... well, why speculate?  But it was not chicken as my body knows and loves it.
1361;Every time I go there I wish not to meet the manager but unfortunately he is working over there most of the time. He is rude and I give 0 score to his customer service.
1362;This place has gone downhill. Now I understand why I had seen a gentleman shouting at the employees for their incompetence the last time I came.I ordered the usual small popcorn chicken and they claimed you can only buy a size large at this location. Weird.. I went to pay at the window and all of a sudden, from the many times I've came here and paid by Amex, they tell me they don't accept Amex. The worst part is, the employee was new and barely spoke English.After that when I got my order, she only gave ONE sauce for a size LARGE. I had to come into the store and be one of those people who ask to speak to their management because the lady serving me was clearly incompetent and lacked common sense. That's when you know it's time to change up my designated KFC location.
1363;I'd get food here every now and then when I felt like having tacos or fried chicken because it's somewhat near home. I assume they'd screw up every now and then but just had the worst experience. Arriving at the drive thru, the employee asks what I'd like, she stops me mid-way and says "can you hold on?" ... I politely say okay and she manages to do this another 4 times. Why even bother ask me what I'd like, if you're just going to continue stopping me? I knew I should've left, but all bad decisions are made when hungry... So, after she finally got my order down, it took more than 10 minutes (four songs on the radio) for her to serve two cars ahead of me. This wasn't even at lunch time!I finally get to the window, she gives me my drink and asks how I'd like to pay. I said pay pass. - I take my card out and tap. She said "hold the machine!" In a very rude tone and i responded by "it's a simple tap..." - according to her "it's not her job to hold the machine, it's 'mine' ". I paid and moved by car up to 
1364;Ordered threee price chicken which was supossed to be two thighs one leg and got two legsWent to the manager to complain and he said I was lying as if I'm Houdini and just made it disappear. Won't be back again, the manager is terribly st
1365;We ordered in:* beef and broccoli- NO BEEF! And whatever beef was in there was tough and over cooked. * lemon chicken - Was cold and came with the lemon sauce on the side. * house fried rice - tasteless * egg roll/spring rolls were good * chicken wing - were good$36 later and one of the worst meals I've ever had!
1366;Terrible. The bbq pork was tough as old boots. The eggplant dish tasted like a mistake. The fried rice was liking eating saw dust. The noodles were devoid of flavour. Never again
1367;Just bad, the worst I've ever had. It sucks! The orange beef is, more of soup, just wrong. It disgusting, disturbed, do not order this.
1368;The location is actually amazing however the service is always bad and extremely slow. If you need a meal prepared, I suggest go somewhere else. And the bakery section is always almost empty. It's one of the worst unkept Tim Hortons I've been to.
1369;Not so friendly service did not enjoy our food was not authentic Greek and very disappointed will not eat at this restaurant again which is too bad it looks like a nice atmosphere from outside.
1370;Found hair in my food, returned it, asking for some without hair. Received no apologies, nothing, just biscuit handed to me. Will never return. Service was also quite slow and rude.
1371;Bought a 12 piece box of chicken to go last Friday night. When i got home discovered they put 6 legs and 5 thighs in the box. Not only did they short me on the chicken but they did not include even one piece of white meat in the order no breast or wing. Will never eat from this franchise again.
1372;Chicken from hell.  Oh my god.I am 45 years old and I have never seen some incompetence and ignorance in my life.  I waited 20 minutes for a shrimp platter and a 4 piece fried chicken platter.  There was another couple who ordered BEFORE us who didn't get their food until over 40 minutes after they ordered.  You can KNIT a bloody chicken faster than that.I specified a sauce substitute that was clearly notated on the receipt.  They screwed it up.  I went back to the counter to get it switched.  The "manager" in the blue shirt walked around for 4-5 minutes and completely ignored me conveying the attitude that he was the "expediter" (what a laugh) and that he didn't deal with customers.  The girl on the cash had her back to me the whole time despite the fact I was trying to subtly tap on the counter to get her attention.  The couple who waited 40 minutes for the chicken loudly admonished me to YELL at them.  I went back to my table and decided to just eat the shrimp dry because they were getting cold.  My wi
1373;When I walked in here this past Saturday, the girls behind the counter were shouting across the room to each other about something, what I don't know. When the most obnoxious girl finally decided to help me I ordered my usual steeped tea. While I waited she quickly filled another order before getting my drink going, which also happened to be a steeped tea. There was a half pot of tea brewed and not quite enough to fill both of the orders. She decided that the prudent thing to do would be to fill each cup with tea equally and then top them off with hot water. I was shocked. I've never seen anything like this before. I gladly would have waited a few minutes for her to brew another pot. Instead she filled a third of the cup with water and sent me on my way. Judging my he casualness with the act it seems like she probably does this regularly. Now I'm not a Timmy's expert or anything but I'm pretty sure this would go against their product quality standards. I was already annoyed from the lack of customer service
1374;The absolute worst cafe to go to. I gave this cafe three tries but every single time has been horrible. My crepe was made undercooked.. how do you make an uncooked crepe? Once I told the server she said the boss said I still have to pay for it. I was completely fine with paying (although I took one bite) but I just wanted her to cook it. She claimed there was nothing she could do. I asked to talk to the manager and she told the server to tell me she didn't want to come out and she was too busy to talk. My friend was unhappy with her ice cream because it had that frost on top like it was sitting there for a long time in the freezer. The cakes were also not fresh mI don't recommend this cafe at all!
1375;Good food, but horrible, horrible slow service. First we weren't seated until we asked to be seated, which was fine, but our orders took forever. 2 of the orders were just simple scoops of ice cream. It took over 20 minutes and the restaurant wasn't even near busy, it was near empty. My order took almost another 30 minutes after that. Then our order of iced coffee and tea never arrived. We ended up having to cancel that part of the order because by that time we had been sitting for over an hour. We also asked for napkins that took 5 minutes to get.When we inquired about the iced coffee and tea, we were told the machine was being cleaned, which is why it was taking so long. By the time we left, it was apparently still being cleaned. How hard is it to make tea? You just need hot water.I'm not sure how the service was so slow when it wasn't even busy. Waiting over 20 minutes for a few scoops of ice cream is beyond ridiculous.
1376;Worst service ever. If you want to come to a place with the worst food, Spin is the place for you. We had to wait for our food and they only brought out only two out of the 3 dessert plates. By the time the last arrive my friends were already done eating. They forgot my other friends drink. On top of that when it came down to get the bill. We had to ask them 3 times. Mind you they were not busy at all. There were in total of 8 - 10 people with 5 people on staff. I get better service at McDonald's then I did at Spin. The food wasn't that great. I would choose Demetres over Spin. Very similar concept but Demetres is way BETTER!
1377;I am very sorry to the owner of this place, but this dessert spot is not good. The place looks good and has comfy chairs and I appreciate you bringing a dessert spot to my area, but unfortunately... I am not a fan at all.I'll start with the good, the servers were friendly enough. Now, what can be improved is the food and dessert. The cakes are not fresh as the server mentioned they are brought in from Cheesecake Factory and I think the pizza is the frozen grocery store kind but I can give a pass on the pizza since this is a dessert place. It looks like the only fresh made desert would be waffles since I saw a bunch of waffle irons by the cake display.I definately like what they are trying to do but I just didn't enjoy my experience here.
1378;Horrid. I can't even express how horrible my experience was here. I wish I could give it a 0. The first time I went they were out of tea and coffee?! Ok... so things happen... I tried to go back another time and the servers are dressed to impress but their service is horrible! They literally didn't show any care in costumer service and didn't ask once how things were. They just leave you. Give you your food and leave you. We had to even go up to get the bill. Horrible customer service. I was in a great mood that day until I went for dessert here! Never again!
1379;If I could give this zero stars I probably would. We waited about 30 minutes to be served the worst breakfast I've ever had at a restaurant. Poached eggs were extremely undercooked and served on probably frozen and terrible crab cakes which I doubt were made on site next to the tiniest salad I've ever seen in my life. The hollandaise sauce I could only compare to a salty mayo?. It was bad. I was actually shocked that the server presented this thinking it was acceptable. The only thing I can say it that the place was nicely decorated. I have never gone to a restaurant and refused to pay but the food at this place was totally gross.
1380;I have to say that I agree with some of the reviews.Decor is great but the rest is spotty.We just went in for dessert and coffee (I mean it is a dessert cafe).Most of their desserts are Dufflet - which is fine, but the prices are really high.Couldn't get over what it cost for a couple pieces of cake and some coffee!Also, maybe they are new?  The server seemed quite inexperienced and actually tried to take our plates away before we were finished.  Things like cutlery and sugar didn't come as part of normal service.  We had to ask.  Where does that happen?Anyway -- the last thing I was not thrilled about was the overwhelming grease smell from the kitchen.I really am not a fan of smelling of stale grease when I leave a restaurant and I sure did not expect it from a dessert spot.Needless to say will be giving a big miss to this spot.Sorry guys!
1381;This was the worst. My friend and I got seated and waited 20 minutes. No one came to take our orders. Everybody working here on Friday night were about 18-20 years old. They were lost and were doing their own thing. They need an adult there to be a manager for some guidance. After not getting our order taken we left. No Service = No food = No customers!
1382;waited 15mins just to be seated when there's like 5 staff galavanting. the place looks elegant and fancy.we have to ask for the menu 2x and still waited 5mins to get one after I asked for the 3rd time and gave the one waiter a look. after waiting another 15mins browsing at expensive menu no one acknowledge us to get our order. gave them another 5mins and we just walked out the place.
1383;We drove through the drive through with intentions of trying the new perfect pairings. As we asked the lady what the options for the soup were, we were surprised to find out chile was an option. We asked if there was an additional price and were precisely told "no", therefore we gladly ordered it. When we got the receipt, we noticed there was an additional charge of $1 and asked what it was for. The rude lady at the window said it was an additional charge for the chili, which at that point caused some confusion, since we were specifically told beforehand that the chile was the same price as all other soups. We asked to speak to the lady who talked to us through the intercom and she argued that "yeah it's the same cost... it's $1 extra", completely contradicting herself. This hypocrite refused to admit her fault in the lies she told us and therefore we were forced to speak to the lady at the window, who again, did not acknowledge that it was her mistake and that we were wronged. We were in a rush to go, hence 
1384;Really horrible customer service. I'm sick and tired of the "breakfast roulette" game I play when I order my food. Most of the time my order is wrong, and working at the hospital I don't have time to go back and have them fix it. All I want is my bagel to be made properly, how I asked for it- why is that so hard? I'm tired of my food being wrong and basically inedible. I've worked for Tim Hortons, in a far busier location, during the morning rush (5a-1p). THIS JOB IS NOT HARD AND THE EMPLOYEES HERE CONSISTENTLY SCREW UP. Don't direct complaints to the manager because he's a idiot. Go on the website and inform corporate. Avoid avoid avoid.
1385;Worst food ever!! Don't order the the general thai beef!!  I tastes more like solid battered rock than beef? Where is the beef? Never coming back again. Gross!!! Worst experience!!
1386;Ignorant ppl who work here and yes it's the rude guy during the week, he is rude stay away they don't even cook your food cause they don't care and they don't seem to like ppl at atll
1387;You won't get good value for your money at this location.  The rice is bland and often not cooked properly.  They go light on the meats and there wasn't much basil in the dish that I got.  I also saw food handling practices that weren't the greatest.  The last time I went the shrimp I received tasted off.  I'll never go back - and my experiences at this location are putting me off visiting any Thai Express location.
1388;I went here more than once because I am usually in the area. I often crave for Thai express but all there times I have been I was not impressed. There self serve sauces are never refilled, also looks empty and the same when I see it, meaning they don't change the bottles? or clean them possibly, I mean this is based of the looks of it. The servers and cooks have no personality, I mean there is no customer service at all here, they look tiresome. The food is ok for a quick craving, I have had better, but this is also a fast food joint so you can't expect to much. I know for sure after I eat at this particular location my stomach feels the pains :(. I wish for high hopes for improvements because this is the quickest way for me to get my pad Thai fix when I am in the area.
1389;Let me add to the chorus of bad reviews as I eat my pad thai. Stopped in for late lunch as I was starving and wanted a fast thai fix.Pad thai was barely passable, lacks any colour or vegetables aside from bean sprouts (menu board pic has peas... no peas given) entire plate of food just drenched in sauce. On the plus side there was an acceptable amount of chicken compared to other reviews.As another review noted the self serve sauces were a sad sight. Bottles filthy and mostly empty... probably the same way since last reviewer's comments! The fountain pop was out of order.Lone staff member looks ready to end it all. I get it that this isn't a dream job but at least pretend to be interested in the food you're serving me. Large TV screen mounted on wall, plastic still on it, coldy turned off, no entertainment or news while you eat your food in this depressing, spacious, dead dining room.Everything about this place screams disappointment.
1390;This is was by far the worst Thai express I ever had! So cheap with toppings, I ordered fish pad thai and got a few tiny pieces that barely resembled fish! I don't mind paying for my food but I expect for 10 bucks some decent meal not a plate full of plain noodles! ! Never again at this location!
1391;Food courts, why do you disappoint me? Two scoops of rice (come on you could do better than that) one of two pcs of potatoes to go along with it with one skewer of chicken. Good grief! Chicken was tender, but lacked flavour. $10 and change for the dinner. They were so bad, they gave me an idea, try it and let me know: Go to Walmart and purchase the Marc Angelo chicken souvlaki skewers. They already come marinated with bonus packs of tzatziki sauce. 8 skewers for $10.00, directions on the back for anyone to follow. Add that in an aluminum foiled tray with some potatoes and in the oven it goes. Meanwhile cook some rice on the stove and make a Greek salad. So easy even the worst cook can do it. So thanks Jimmy The Greek!
1392;If i could give it no stars i would, overpriced greekfood that is horrible. Portion is small i still feel hungry after eating the meal. It was ok before but now its  not a good place to go to
1393;I went to this location and they were out of "Whopper meat". I find it scary that : 1) They don't refer to it as beef and 2) That when I spoke to the manager to express my dissatisfaction, her reply was : "So what do you want from me?"Wow. Amazing.
1394;Burger king Review 195 Fletchers Creek Boulevard Unfortunately the Standard of this restaurant is very poor. I am very disappointed to be writing this review. Where do I start from while coming into the restaurant waiting several minutes be severed. The management is just unbelievable they have no knowledge how to treat or talk to customers they have attitude and treat there customers very disrespectful not just simply providing the customer with what they have asked for not even listening to the customer properly without having a smile on there face while they acknowledge there slow and mixed up services not even giving customers a right portion for what they have payed for either giving less fries filling more then half cup with ice or giving less sauce then charging for asking for a little bit more which is just not acceptable and then on top of that showing attitude. There food is not a equal and fair portions customers are just wasting there money at this restaurant not getting the right potions paying
1395;I had the worst experience ever. i did not feel welcomed in the establishment and felt as if i was  burdening them with my order. i went to get food but i left with a burger and a shitty mood. Even a little kindness goes a long way.
1396;My last 5 experiences (ranging over the course of a couple years) have been less-than-stellar.  I used to love Swiss Chalet, but they're slipping, particularly this location.The chicken is sub-bar, portions are small, and their dessert (my favourite: apple crisp) is a complete joke.I've given them plenty of chances to change my mind (5 times!) and now I don't bother trying anymore.  There are better places to eat in Newmarket.  This is not one of them.
1397;Was on the east end of town decided to try this swiss chalet.. they dressed it up nice. But that's it. Food was blandAppetizer sent back as the chase loaf cheese was not melted...Second attempt at appetizer was burnt.. (charred)Didn't bother with a third attempt...Chicken was dry. Wife had a chicken sandwich... no mayo (asked for extra)We won't be hoping back to this location. Green lane location is always good
1398;Really bad customer service! The workers at the drive-thru always rush you out so fast you burning yourself with your hot drink or spilling it all over your brand new car because they don't even give you enough time to properly place down your cup and food. Other than that, 70% of the time i get coffee from here, it's burnt coffee. So much for being "always fresh". I even complained about the servce to the complaint email address and they seem to not give a fuck as they ignored my emails three times. I get my coffee from a little local grocery store now, Concord Foods. Even though they have no drive-thru, at least I get good customer service and non-burnt coffee.
1399;The Asian lady that works on the cash is extremely rude, I asked for a medium triple triple in an extra large cup, she gave it to me in a medium cup and said their extra large cups are roll up the rim therefore she can not give that to me.I said that's tim hortons problem not mine, so I asked her to put my coffee in a large cup instead since she didn't want to give me the extra large cup, she didn't do that but she gave me the large cup.So I poured the coffee from the medium to large and left the medium cup on top of the counter and in a very rude voice she said "next time don't leave the cup on the top of the counter, throw it in the garbage", I would have have done that if she had done it herself which she should have put it in a large cup at least if she didn't want to give me the extra large cup.Forwarding this complaint to Tim Hortons Headoffice and posting it on several other internet review sites.Hopefully she changes her attitude and not act so b*****.
1400;I've only been to this location a handful of times, unfortunately and with consistency there is always a slow moving line, slow service. Recent visit was a spent waiting in line with others while counter staff discussed among themselves and then waiting for my order which had been prepared but sat for 3-5 min. No enjoy, apology or acknowledge really, just a look of, whatever...
1401;I have been living in the area for 6 years,  every time I go to this Tim Hortons the service is so slow, you have to wait so long in line with employees just passing you by paying attention more attention to drive thru.
1402;Absolutely the worst value for your money.  The menu does NOT reflect what you are actually getting. Ordered a fattoush salad with a beef skewer which the menu shows as two (2) skewers and got the salad (rather small portion) and one (1) skewer.  All this for about $20 for a take out lunch.  Stay away and avoid a bad experience.  If it helps, me va me a better choice (fair distance away) or any other nearby place at the village. Understand new location but not worth it.
1403;I received an email from the owner offering me a free meal, with the statement "Although the quantity will be the same, the quality will be better". Hmmm, what is this supposed to mean?  Either way, I don't want the free meal, I stand by my review and the false advertising in the menu.
1404;What a disappointment!  I had a good meal at Paramount Brampton and was looking forward to sharing the same with a group of Toronto friends.  No comparison!  I ordered the Fatoush salad and like previous comments it was overpriced for what I got, too much dressing and not authentic and literally 6 small pita bits added.  My beef kabob on top had to be cut into tiny pieces to make it chewable and the whole thing was overpriced.  There were 8 of us and the dinners arrived in series so that some of us could wait and could  eat cold food, or we could eat while the others waited.  The server was pleasant, but couldn't keep the orders straight and totally confused the bills, the kitchen was slow and disorganized and the food was less than mediocre.  Only the bill was over the top!  Definitely not up to PARAMOUNT standards!.  We will not be going back.
1405;Thought I'd try this place out after having shawarma in Ottawa to compare and expected to be thoroughly disappointed, and guess what ...I was! Flavours and quality of the food = dismal, portion size = inadequate, value = over priced, service = average but the servers should learn to have a little bit of charm.Not coming back here unless they change it to be more like Shwarma Palace.
1406;This place needs a new manager. Went in with some friends who were getting their food to go. They ordered 3 chicken shawarmas 10 minutes before I ordered and received them 20 minutes after I got my food. The waiter forgot to add the cheese I requested and it had to be sent back to the kitchen. There was also garlic sauce on my shawarma when I specifically asked for none. My gf ordered tabouleh and it never came out so after a while we asked about it and the waiter said "oh you actually wanted that.." I don't understand what he was writing on the paper because he seemed to forget everything we said. 10 minutes later he came back to ask us if we still wanted it. We said yes and received the worst tabouleh ever. Our glasses were constantly empty and I had to ask several times through the meal to get more water. This process is pretty simple... remember what people order and make sure a glass of water is never empty. This all happened while the place was empty. There seemed to be a discconect between the wait sta
1407;The place is well renovated and... that's about it.Price is ridiculous for food that isn't even that delicious, was basically complete cold the time I got back to the office. Service aren't all that great. Has a weird take out process. Definitely not coming back.
1408;So I was stupid enough to order from here again.this Time after I placed my order, I called the store to make sure they got everything correct. After I got my order which again I payed just under 70 bucks for, ONE OF THE MAIN ENTREES I ORDERED WASNT THERE. I called and spoke to the "owner" who first told me I could come drive there and pick it up. I told the wonder that to drive there and pick it up would be absurd, as the entire REASON I payed extra for delivery was that I was working late and could not leave. Then the wonder told me to call UBEREATS and said it was the fault of UBEREATS.Then the owner said he would maybe drive the food over to me, but then he said that THE KITCHEN WAS CLOSED AND THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO. He told me that the next day I could call and he would deliver the one item. It meant one of the people that was with me had to share an entree and we were both still hungry. I don't need to get fooled more than once to know that this place is a fucking mess and can't even complete a s
1409;I have eaten middle eastern food all over Toronto. Came here for lunch and ordered a simple Swarma. While waiting out of curiously I looked here and was surprised at the low scoring reviews. Then my sandwich arrived and I realized my wife and I had different toppings (but I hadn't ordered any of my toppings). Not the end of the world and I was hungry so I didn't say anything and my sandwich was okay. My son didn't like the pickles or beets and picked his out. It is just odd that when u publish toppings on the menu you don't ask what people want and unless this is the McDonald's of middle eastern food that is just weird. Service was horrid and the waitress that only had a few tables obviously had no training. Then somebody burnt bread in the kitchen which is not pleasant but to make matters worse I saw the owner or manager on duty spraying febreeze at the front door. Weird again but then he started walking by my table and a few others and spraying. My family was done but someone who just got their food must ha
1410;Wow. This place is horrendous. If you are considering trying Paramount Fine Foods Liberty Village I would strongly urge you to reconsider. There is absolutely nothing "fine" about the food at this place. Frankly it couldn't be further from "fine". The attention and care this place puts into the quality and taste of their food is about the same attention you would expect a heroin addict to pay to the cleanliness of the needle they use. I ordered a chicken shawarma plate with fries and a shish tawook plate with white rice. What little chicken there was among the pile of crap I got served was hard, cold, and dry as if it were a week old.    If I could give lower than a one star rating I would. Avoid at all costs.
1411;Wasn't too impressed. The waiter we had was extremely awkward and made the experience feel awkward and kind of uncomfortable. I don't think they were comfortable in that role. The food...too over priced for what you get. I ordered Fattoush Salad with chicken. The salad was eh - not that good - had the dressing but almost just tasted like a garden salad the ingredients weren't soaked in the dressing so it didn't taste like a regular Fattoush to me, and I only got 4 tiny pieces of chicken on the salad. Those 4 pieces of chicken cost $6.99 to add to the $7.99 salad (pictures included in my review). By the time you order 2 main entrees, your better off getting a platter - way better deal. Don't think the platter should be cheaper than 2 meals considering the platters come with a lot more food. Not priced correctly. Service: awkward Food: nothing amazing and Fattoush was really lacking in flavour. Price: expensive for what you get. Personally, I wouldn't go there again. Wish I read the reviews below b
1412;Food: horrible, tasted like everything was microwaved and none of the staff knew English. Service: horrible Not much else to say about here. Definitely wouldn't go here again.
1413;TERRIBLE Service! We went to Paramount on my son's birthday because we heard the food was great. We'd made a reservation (and confirmed it the day before) but when we arrived, the staff didn't know anything about it and seemed inconvenienced by a large group (ten of us). All of the tables were full so we were seated at the very drafty take out table by the door. We waited for nearly twenty minutes for someone to take our order and around thirty minutes for water (!) and bread to arrive at the table. We waited a full HOUR for our meals to arrive, in the meantime putting up with huffy, eye-rolling waitstaff. It's too bad because when the food arrived? It was pretty good. Sorry Paramount, you need to teach your staff some manners and get organized.
1414;First time here, won't come back. Food looked good but the service was brutally slow. My meal basically didn't come, and I sort of refuse to wait an hour for a falafel ... seem to prioritize take out orders over people in the restaurant.
1415;Awful place reminds me coffee time, my sandwich was cold and hard , nothing is fresh , pouting was cold and tasting like old
1416;Worst KFC experience ever!  Wish I could give negative stars.  Walked in yesterday to a screaming crazy male customer proceeded by an unresponsive ditzy blonde girl taking orders and a screaming crazy manager woman who thought it was ok to continue talking EXTREMELY loudly while on her cell phone the whole time.  I felt as if I had entered the Twilight Zone!!!!
1417;The food really sick had a poutine and on my way home to throw it up. Disgusting the store is always dirty and the staff looks like they don't even want to be there.  To top it all off they play the most ridiculous music for an eating establishment. I will never go back there I am so turned off!!!!
1418;the only good thing about this meal is the fact that it was twenty minutes early. the beef curry was watered down, the pakoras were undercooked and tasted fishy in the middle(almost threw up) and when i thought the guy was going to the car to grab change he drove off. such a waste of money. tried to eat the meat but it was mostly gristle and bone, wouldnt give it to my dog 20 dollars wasted.... order from somewhere else please and there was a hair in my rice
1419;BAR none the worst Indian food i have ever eaten,and i have eaten plenty.  To start the delivery took almost 2 hours,the food was greasy,the naan was stale and smelled like 2 week old bread...what a waste of money.  Please save yours and find somewhere else to order from.
1420;1. Delivery was quoted at 60 minutes.  It was 20 minutes late.2. The driver called me and asked for directions.  I just moved to the area and did not know how to direct him. Regardless, it was kind of bush league on his part, he should have been prepared.3. By far the worst Indian food I have EVER had.  I was completely shocked at how greasy this food was.  The beef curry was so watered down, it hardly tasted like curry and there was very little meat in the dish.  The vegetable dish was extremely greasy as well, just a bunch of cauliflower doused in oil and sprinkled with a little curry powder. The rice was not fresh. The muttar paneer was not fresh and had a burnt taste to it.  The pakoras and samosas were also ridiculously greasy.Every place in Little India is probably better than this place.
1421;The delivery was fast and the delivery dude was nice but it turned out that this would unfortunately be the highlight of the meal.Three words come to mind......BLAND BLAND and oh yes BLAND.All the curries might as well have been slightly thickened coloured water with a good thick oil slick floating atop all of them.  The meats within the curries were cooked well but like the curry sauces themselves, very BLAND and scarce.  The naans were decent and the pakoras were passable.Stay away even if you're only looking for decent or merely passable Indian food.  I've had much better Indian food out of "President Choice Memories of......" Jars or packets.
1422;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The Good: they serve a mean Diet Coke. Excellent Diet Coke. Good straw too. The Bad: Once the food was ordered, the server activated her Predator cloaking device and she disappeared. The food took 45 minutes to be served! To be fair there was another 4 people in the restaurant though. I'm sure that put a strain on the "cook". When it was time to pay for the bill, the Predator reemerged. The Ugly: everything was burnt. Even the saganaki "opah" cheese was made to sit on the table opposite ours. I had a few minutes to just sit there and watch it burn in flames. At least 3 minutes before it occurred to her to use the lemon wedge to put out the fire. The souvlakia were all burnt to a dry crisp. The rice tasted like it was cooked in dishwater and even the potatoes smelled and tasted like the secret ingredient in the lemon sauce was rat poison. Folks,  I'm not exaggerating. This is what happens when a restaurant doesn't taste their own food. If they did,  I'm sure they would h
1423;Service 0/5Atmosphere 0/5Food 3.5/5I'm truly upset about the whole experience I had at this restaurant. There is another location on Dufferin which is not like this one at all. Only 2 waitstaff on a busy Sunday. No host to greet you. Everyone dining was squished into one corner on the top level of the restaurant. The waitress seemed like this was her first day talking to people. Absolutely no people skills at all. The atmosphere was unpleasant. We were seated at a dirty table and had to move. Carpet was dirty. The only decent thing about this place was the food which wasn't amazing and didn't stand out. I would definitely not return.
1424;I would save your money and head into the mall for a taste of Greek food. Portion size is great but no real flavour. Everything is just salty with a hint of familar Greek spicies. One important advice, the girl at the take-out counter might crush your take-out food. The poor thing is miserable there.
1425;First impression was not positive. Everything looked dirty: windows covered in slime, debris on floors, decaying plaster at entrance... thankfully I went to bathroom before ordering. Disgusting! If the entrance, dining room and bathrooms are so filthy, I can't imagine the state of the kitchen. Prices are expensive. We walked out.
1426;Place used to be mr.greek, they just change the name and increased the prices otherwise the food is not that great and its smaller portion. I think they should close down all together. I dont recomend to anyone unless you want to thru away your money. However the wait staff are good.
1427;This is the worst restaurant to go to!! We ate there a few weeks prior to this visit and one menu had a list of Persian dishes. We came back here tonight for my mom's birthday and asked the waitress what happened to the Persian menu in the back of the menu and she looked at us like we were nuts! She was also very rude and mean and was very abrasive. She didn't come to our table prior to ordering to ask if we wanted drinks. It's not like the place was busy. It was on a Wednesday during a snow storm. There was hardly any patrons at the place. It took 25 minutes just to get our water. This was the last time I or my family would set foot in this place. Waste of time!! Go somewhere else if you want a decent meal. For a $16 dish, I would expect better service than what I would get at a fast food place at the mall!
1428;A restaurant really needs to disappoint for such a review... and sadly this restaurant most definitely won't last more than 6 months with the service and food.Ordered takeout from this location online yesterday... I had called in soon after placing my order just to confirm payment methods the lady who had answered the phone had mentioned the internet was not working on her end so she can't receive my order... not a problem I repeated my order STRAIGHT off the internet... This girl who supposedly works at this restaurant claimed they didn't have 2 of the dishes I had ordered online. Then after rereading the details of the dish she claimed I can only get that as a dine in option. I asked her as to why it would be on the pick up menu online then... her answer.. I don't know.. how lovely... I asked that it be made and she said fine... But only if the turmoil ended there... I also ordered the shrimp and salmon linguine which according to the site was in a wine reduction sauce. When I asked for the linguine sh
1429;There's nothing special about the Greek food here. The food was very dry and didn't taste fresh at all. Try another Greek restaurant instead.
1430;We tried the Dufferin location and were really turned off at the lack of flavour and authenticity. We decided to try the Richmond Hill location and were equally as disappointed. $15.80 for a village salad, that didn't taste particularly fresh (and didn't come with any bread) was such a waste of money. Sad to say, but this is not authentic Greek food. I miss Mr. Greek!
1431;I have ordered food from Krystos COUNTLESS times and while I can't speak for the sit-down part of the restaurant, I can speak for the take-out portion: awful. Not only do they forget things to add necessities like napkins and cutlery, but they also forget to add the things that we actually ordered: like lemon or particular sides. The business before them wasn't doing well and either is Krystos. My best guess is that it's soiled ground. Whatever the reason, save yourself the headache and go to Swiss Chalet across the street.
1432;I was excited for another Greek restaurant to open up in that location, since Mr Greek was a big fail and went downhill very quickly over the years. I ordered the chicken Greek. The chicken came raw three times. Yes. I sent it back thee times. The cook couldn't seem to cook it thoroughly. Never ended up eating the chicken. The salad was disgusting. The dressing was not your traditional Greek dressing. It was sweet like something you would pour on a dessert. The waiter was unable to comp the chicken. Even though it never came back to me eatable. Definitely do not waste your time or hard earned money.
1433;Walked in sat down carpet was sticky asked to move no one came to see to us. Waited 5 min got up and walked out. Very dirty place looks like a new restaurant on the outside but inside they need serious cleaning and more staff
1434;This place is ABSOLUTELY GARBAGE !!! Save your money and don't waste your time. Since the change from Mr. Greek to this new place Krystos...this place has gone down the toilet...which is exactly what your experience will be here, crap!Besides the food being overcooked, terrible ingredients and awful...The waiter was new, so I don't fault him. But the "manager" is a complete @ss. He is actually also the guy cooking your meal. Seriously! We had a party of 8, they brought out 6 meals...and the other 2 when the first 6 ppl were done. Lol When I went to ask for the manager, some young short Indian dude behind the grill came around the corner and said "what"...I explained to him the situation...and he game complete attitude and at the end he reluctantly said "fine I'll take %10 off"...I wasn't satisfied with that but went back to the table...only to find that the seafood platter they had FINALLY brought out was missing the shrimp that was supposed to be on there. I went back to tell the manager I went to the mana
1435;Would not accommodate Greek fries with the meal I wanted. No upgrade or anything, cool I guess. Chicken souvlaki was undercooked with a pink middle. Not cool. Fries, nothing to brag about. McCain fries out of the bag. Will not come back
1436;Distgusting.  From the decor to the bathrooms. The food was the worst greek food i have ever tasted in my life.  I walked in at 9:30 and I was the only one here.  Should have seen the red flag.  Do yourself a favour and just turned around.
1437;I ordered fried calamari appetizer and it was a very small portion for $12.00 and soaking in oil.  No dip included.  Or maybe it is extra charge. Order was quick alright but hey I was willing to wait to have the food prepared fresh but don't feed me re-fried calamari. If they can't do it right on take out, Dining in must be even worse.
1438;I definitely would not recommend or come back. They wouldn't accommodate anything if you wanted to change something in your meal. The meat wasn't all the way cooked. The service was very awkward as well.
1439;Don't go here, go to Subway across the street. The owner is ridiculous. I would give this place zero stars if it were possible. Very cheap with the toppings, and made me feel guilty for asking for an adequate amount after only putting on 4 slivers of mushrooms. Then sarcastically said "since you picked so many toppings, why stop there?". I'm there for a sub, not to be guilt tripped about wanting toppings on it. Definitely not returning.
1440;Got a 12" turkey on white..the worst sub ever!!!! dry, lack of sauce, extremely salty, very cheap on the ingredients, lettuce is heavy but this is the worst tasting sub and the owner is the same as before.  He is cheap as can be and least generous with the assembly of ingredients.  Furthermore, the ingredients are far from fresh.  The bread tastes stale too. Some things never change even though the renovation took place.  You'd think things would improve.  Far from!! Do not go here unless you want to get ripped off.
1441;Owner/operator was comical.  I asked for an assorted sub and he prompted me for nothing.Started putting the meat on etc...and wrapping it without asking about toppings!I kid you not!.  I asked for my toppings and he said "why didn't you ask for them earlier?"I laughed and walked out.
1442;We came here because the place we wanted to go was full.  Though to be fair we probably should have just gone home. The service was abysmal and hilariously slow especially given the fact that the bar was empty it should have been faster.  I ordered a BLT which arrived on barely toasted wonder bread, with mealy  tomatoes and raw bacon.  If your on college and hungry give this hole a miss and go somewhere else....
1443;Disaster !The website photos and menu descriptions sound ok but the reality is very poorly executed.  I had the grilled veggie wrap - which had no grilled veggies, just a salad wrap.  Pathetic.  My date had the shrimp - billed as HUGE on the menu but came as 5 of the tiniest shrimp...However...they have a sunny patio and even with the street exposure a beer on a patio is always nice.  Just forget the food.  Hope they improve :(
1444;Want to get harassed by old men? Feel physically threatened? This is a great place to go if you're looking to be made to feel incredibly uncomfortable. I feel bad for the staff--who are very pleasant--but the regulars at this bar are super sketchy. Came for the karaoke, left because of the creeps.
1445;Ugh. Food is crap. If Ur famished, the dry Cajun wings are a safe bet. Comes with celery and carrot and fries. Food has been a disappointment for years. Patio is nice though. The regulars are good guys and entertaining. Karaoke is fun.
1446;The service is horrible, it takes forever to get a drink. Food is greasy and unappetizing. Has about as much ambiance as an airport checkin counter. Pretty much nothing good to say about this place, you get the picture.
1447;Took 3 hours to get food. Ran out of corona. Server had attitude. Sound waaay too loud. Manager should consider staffing more people. Will not come back again.
1448;Terrible service. Very unorganized staff. Forgot about our drinks and food. I'd suggest writing orders down next time, it's not that hard to do! It wasn't even very busy and the lack of service was terrible.
1449;This bar must have changed hands since my last visit. They have a cool space, lots of TV's, and a big, full bar. Tonight the woman serving us did not speak much english, nor did she understand our orders - I see this as the main issue, because that is where the issues started.  There was plenty of staff working but only the bar guy had fluent English comprehension and speaking.  Our order came out extremely slow, we were not served at the same time, 2 of the 3 of us did not get our drinks, and the food order was 100% incorrect.  My husband ordered a meal thay did not come out at all.  7 innings worth of time to get our first plate of food...not even close to what anyone ordered... Game was over... Still no drinks... tried to bill us for food, drinks, other people's stuff...  The bar was relatively quiet for a Jays game being on, the kitchen maybe only turned out 8 plates for the whole game but the Bar guy said the kitchen was overwhelmed.  Mom asked them to remove all the random charges (someone obviously c
1450;Man...The Abbey.I've had the misfortune of living a minute away from this place for the last four years, and so, out a desire for extreme convenience, I've given it a number of chances.Here's what you need to know:- The pretty Asian girls who work the bar may not know what a Jack and Coke is, but if you do enough pointing and talking very slowly, you can have one for eight dollars. They may need some help finding the button on the computer. - The Makers Mark is not Makers Mark. My guess tonight was that they had filled it with Northern Harvest rye, which, if you're going to fill bottles with other stuff, ain't a bad choice.- They do karaoke twice a week, although it seems like they do karaoke every night. This is actually my favourite thing about the place. I've enjoyed being a fly-on-the-wall throughout, in a sort of social-experimenty way (I fucking sang a few times okay? Don't give me grief). There's an old dude who is here every single karaoke night. He looks like a biker extra from a Canadian f
1451;I was a regular here for a while, and I wish I could get every penny I spent back. The food is terrible and it's usually empty except for a handful of regulars, who are pretty much all men. Some of them are nice. Some of them are awful, and they are friends with the owners, so they basically run the place.I was sexually harassed at the Abbey more times than I can count - intimately hugged, ogled, pawed at, leered at, flirted with. But they'd leave eventually and the hangs with the bartenders were always fun.The final straw came for me when, during an argument with one of the bar's resident creeps, he openly leered at my breasts, laughing. I started to cry. He was joined by Friday night's new karaoke host, who also commented on my breasts - absolutely unacceptable.If you cause a scene against one of the bar creeps, he will literally speed-dial the owners, who will show up whatever time of night to defend him. I feel badly for having brought my friends (and family!) to this bar over the time I spent there,
1452;The quality & service sucks here.  I'm not coming here again EVER!
1453;- pizza pizza is a pretty standard joint - much love to the fact that they've taken their brand a long way.- this location however, although was really really lacking in their pizza slices choice and freshness.- walked in on a tuesday evening, and found that all the pizzas they had on display were dried out, really lacking any edible appeal, as well as toppings. super chincy.- never again for this specific location.
1454;WORST SUSHI RESTAURANT IN TORONTO. The wait time is so long, service is crap and sushi is mediocre.Ordered takeout and waited 45 minutes for my order to be completed. The Asian owner inside not once said sorry for waiting 45 minutes and was extremely rude.The food is awful and tastes like poor quality sushi. I am so disappointed and I hope no one will encounter this. I wonder how this place is still open with this type of food & service. I will never come back again.Don't waste your money here, there's 20 more sushi restaurants nearby with better sushi and service !!!Awful awful awful experience!
1455;Worst sushi of 2015 award goes to....sushi style!!!So little fish on rolls that my fish-obsessed cat did not notice I was eating fish. Honestly, the slices of fish were the diameter of a quarter and paper thin. Also, the rolls were supposed to have avocado, but the amount of avocado was the smallest I have ever seen. Gyoza were raw. Nothing was very tasty and there were extra sauces on things (to cover up the poor quality?). So disappointed and feeling like I was taken advantage of- I may as well have lit my money on fire and watched it burn. Be forewarned and go elsewhere!
1456;Ordered through Tasteaway with a good discount code. The rolls were falling apart, though the rice was well seasoned. The soup was very salty. We got only a few slices of ginger. Not enough for 40 rolls.The delivery was quick, but here is the problem:The driver harassed us for a tip. My husband forgot to grab some change on his way down and just as he was going to explain, the driver asks "can I have a tip?" Husband comes back up. I decided the man had forfeited his tip. I was getting dressed to go down and speak to him about his rude behaviour and he buzzes us again claiming he thought we weren't coming back. I educated him that especially when you already receive an hourly wage, you shouldn't expect tips. Tips come with good service, not because you shake people down for them. And that you don't press the issue further by essentially begging.The nerve!
1457;WARNING THIS PLACE MADE ME SICK!!!!! Sushi came warm and the fish was not fresh. After eating a few pieces of sushi I felt like I was going to vomit and had to go to the washroom. Called to complain, the manager pretty much told me to F!@# off. DON'T EAT HERE!
1458;Tried to order food. Never showed up. After 2 hours we canceled the order. They just kept lying, telling us it was on the way. Horrible waste of time.
1459;Was so hyped about the sushi burrito, but disappointment. This things like thrown together like a sloppy joe..... They do not care. Its a total mess when opening the packaging sauce is dripping, the salmon is cut poorly, everything is not good.not worth 8-10$ for a burrito
1460;I've been wanting to try the sushirrito for a while now and just had to try it when I found out this place serves it. Definitely disappointed though, the portion of fish inside the roll was small and it wasn't fresh. They also put some REALLY spicy ginger and wasabi inside the roll. The asparagus was fried tempura style but it was hard and just did not taste good. The roll fell apart after 2 bites and was just a huge mess. Still on the hunt for a delicious sushirrito :(
1461;The food is nothing like what the menu suggests. I ordered:Unagi don - large bed of rice with a few drizzles of sweet sauce and 5 thin slices of eelSeafood ramen - broth was decent but noodles were mushy with a total of 3 small shrimp and 1 fake crab meatWould avoid!
1462;We just had an absolutely inedible meal, completely destroyed by Foodora's rider, and probably past due before it was even sent.  Unreal - Foodora and Sushi Style combined for the worst meal I've ever had the displeasure of paying for.  Sushi that's been sitting all day prepackaged, and then smashed up  inside the boxes.  We had to throw it out - absolutely inedible. I still can't get the taste out of my mouth.
1463;Ordered a 48 piece veggie set, and a 8 piece cucumber roll. What I received was a 48 piece set without the cucumber roll I paid for. After being on the phone with them for 15 minutes of them arguing it, saying their menu was wrong. The 48 piece set is actually a 40 piece set and the cucumber rolls i ordered are in there, that's why there are 48 pieces. Would not refund my money for the extra set I didn't receive, didn't care nor understand the issue, and said it was my fault. Ridiculous. After fighting forever with them, they finally gave me the cucumber roll I paid for.... except it wasn't cucumber rolls at all. It was rice unravelled with cucumber pieces all over the place. I'm sure the chef obviously saw that the pieces weren't rolled!??!  I'm not even talking a bit of spillage here, i'm saying all 8 rolls weren't rolls at all. It was a container of rice and cucumber. Absolutely ridiculous. Will never go back, don't waste your money.
1464;We placed an online order at 6:14 PM. It is now 9:01 PM and our order still has not arrived. We called to inquire twice. The first time, after waiting 2 hours, we were told that our order would be a further 30 min wait. We waited a further 35 minutes and called again. The phone representative apologized for the extremely long delivery time with our order, said that he did not work at the store that we called directly, and said that no one at the store would answer the phone. This sounds promising! Despite a 3 hour wait, he could not tell us when our order would be delivered, offered us a pathetic $10 credit for our next order (why, for any reason, would we order from Pizza Hut again?), and actually encouraged us to cancel our order. Ridiculous!Before placing the order, we expected a longer than usual delivery time because of the current weather situation outside. However, having to wait almost 3 hours now with no communication from the store, and no indication of when the order might arrive, is just complet
1465;Decided to make use of the promotion where you buy a large pizza at full price and any consecutive medium pizzas would be 5$ each.Super Supreme Thin & crispy: Felt more like thin and chewy. very salty.Meat lovers pizza: Very salty to the point that the salt was overwhelming all the other ingredients.Ceasar Supreme: Again very salty and doughy. Customer service: pretty useless. I did the survey and asked to be contacted by the manager. It has been nearly 2 weeks and nothing. If pizza hut is good (coz it is the first time im having it), this location is the worst to represent it. I highly recommend other locations or another pizzeria. Atleast  Dominoes pizza truly holds themselves accountable for a bad experience with their pizza (your next order, regardless of the amount of toppings or size, is free).
1466;Ordered a large pizza for pick up, regular cheese sauce, and one topping of strip bacon. Didn't mind spending the $16.90 to get my favourite pizza once a week from Pizza Hut although this was first time from this location. Was disappointed at the lack of cheese sauce and bacon, they're obviously undercutting on the ingredients big time to save money, I couldn't bother to complain and wait for a new one to be made, was too hungry. Thinking about getting Pizza Hut? I suggest use a different location..
1467;Staff here need an attitude adjustment. Seems unless you are a regular, you are an outsider. Super rude, I should be lucky to be served by them. Apple juice is much smaller than other Country Styles I've been to. Tiny english muffins, I had to ask if it was the right size. Won't return.
1468;*PLEASE READ whether you're looking to be hired, or if you are a customer. Former employee review:I applied for a job here about 2 weeks ago, and was promptly hired, despite having no experience working in food. I began work 2 days ago, and was never instructed on what attire to wear for work, and the head manager referred to me indirectly as dressed like a "whore" over the phone, despite my clothing being casual (dark blue ballet flats, grey leggings, white t-shirt covered by a blue lined sweater that covered my hips down to my mid- thighs) for the shift they randomly scheduled me for, without ulterior explaination of how to know which shift one employee is to be scheduled for. On the first day, I witnessed dirty wet smelly cloths being used to wipe the counters behind the tills, and to clean the knife used to cut sandwiches, as well as another wet, smelly dirty cloth being used to clean the cream dispenser, which went right into customers mouths daily. Not trained properly to use machines besides the c
1469;Went there only because I had an excellent food & staff experience with their HWY 7 location in the past. Ordered the same thing as before, their burger, the most economical one and boy, was I disappointed!!!Food - Oily fries soggy, oxidized lettuce stale bun.Service - OK.I think, the lettuce or fries by itself would be a BIG turn off and I had a collection of bad stuff going on that day at this location. It was very busy but still does not justify my food quality being poor. Destroyed my appetite and also my experience that day. I blame the cook, manager & quality control of that Sheppard location and not the restaurant itself. Try the HWY 7 location, it will be a better experience.
1470;Hair in my wings to start...was part of a larger work group and tried to discreetly show it to the waiter. He made a good effort, so applaud him...yet kitchen was unbearably slow, service disorganized, and wings were missing flavour, sauce and fairly thin. Can't think of a reason to return.
1471;Came here twice, first experience was okay, second experience was horrible. The first time I decided to go here, the wait time was pretty bad, however my boyfriend and I wanted to eat here so decided to kill time in the mall until they called us. We got called 30 minutes later. The food was good, however the service was horrible. The waiter always took forever to approach us, and made it seem like it was so busy, when it really wasn't. We didn't care as much, because the food was good.However, during our second visit.. I would say their wait time is horrible, and they should really do something about it. Considering I'm not the only one who thinks it after reading the reviews for this place. We put our names down on the wait list, and got called an hour and 50 minutes later, when the host told us the wait was an hour. The food was okay at this location, however the fries felt like it was soggy or something which was gross. Wings and dessert were pretty good. However, the service was horrible, especially
1472;The waitress brought me the wrong order.  When i told her she took it away and didn't offer me anything complimentary and i sat and watched my friend eat  his meal. When they finally brought the right dish the chicken tasted like hockey pucks.  When the bill arrived they didn't even take off anything from the bill not even a drink to compensate for their mistake. Terrible customer service.
1473;The most inefficient wait list system and the most inefficient staff at a fast paced environment/restaurant. They wait list people and tell them 1.5-2hr wait, and that they will call when table is ready. When I walked inside it was not even busy, many empty tables but not being seated, cleaned or was being cleaned very slowly. A lot of time being wasted on the phone calling ppl back and waiting for them (or only part of the party) to come back to the restaurant instead of seating people who are already there with the full party and was wait listed as well. Ppl come back after 1.5 hours and there is still at least another hour wait...ridiculous. And hostess is easily side tracked, and only took half my number down for the wait list and walked away and attended to other people..
1474;Go to any other location other than this. It took them 15 minutes to take our orders. We then waiting over an hour for our food and when we got it all the orders were either wrong or ice cold... the wait staff is stressed and flustered however they chat amongst themselves which wastes even more time, just so brutal, never go
1475;Last night, my family and I visited St.Louis Bar and Grill for the first time and were highly disappointed by both the food and the service. We arrived at around 9pm and it was relatively busy. After placing our order, the appetizers arrived in a long-awaited 40 minutes (the remainder of our food came in intervals of 15 minutes). In this time, my dad light-heartedly asked our waiter about the food in a joking manner and each time he did, the waiter responded dryly, "Just wait". Later on in the night, my dad attempted to call our waiter for a refill but seeing as how he was far away and the place being as loud as it was, he clapped a few times in order to get his attention. Our waiter returned with a confused look on his face and without even asking what it was that we needed first, he felt the need to lecture my dad in etiquette by telling him, "You shouldn't clap, it's very rude". The gesture was not meant to be one with that intent it was solely a way of grabbing his attention when he couldn't hear us the 
1476;Mediocre wings, salad, frites and service. Service was nothing special. I guess with the great weather today, the servers rather be sitting on the patio having a beer than serving on the patio. Employees looked tired and miserable. The place could use a good cleaning, like sweep the floors etc. A cutting board with oranges, limes and lemons were sitting out in the open.  I had better wings at Gabby's!
1477;I came here and was blown away by how small and tight this place is!! Honestly the size of a classroom.We came, they gave us a table, whatever. There were 3 waiters, no one seemed to ask if we wanted anything. Eventually they brought up drinks. Anyways our food came, my boyfriends fries were COLD. And I got my sandwich/soup/salad trio with fries. They actually forgot the fries and i had to ask for them. Mine were hot and fresh, the waitress told me to be careful cause they were fresh....I thought it was obvious that ALL foods had to be fresh.Did i mention that when our food came, we had NO utensils? We had to ask for our forks, napkins etc.Anyways i didn't like the french onion soup, they were nice enough to let me have their potato bacon soup. That was really good. Fries were good, sandwich was alright.Greek salad was kinda gross!!! Not fresh!They didn't really come back to check up on us, asked if we wanted more to drink.The service is alright... 3/5Food 3/5 (average, minus the cold fries)De
1478;Overall: their staff have been inadequately trained regarding their customer service and smart serve training To begin, servers Nate and Hanna did as best they could. Spent the better part of the day with a friend to catch up. While we ate, drank and talked our server told us to slow down on drinks as we were going to get cut off.... We were having approx. one drink an hour with food.... Our server didn't want to cut us off (she knew we were fine) the bartender (Liz)  did, who had never met us. I approached her and she said it was from past patrons who had gotten into their cars after drinking there...neither of us had driven there... They lack the capacity to use their smart serve (I'm a bartender also) and intelligence it was distasteful. Another friend who joined us also said he was cut off after a few beers within a respectable amount of time. The staff cannot defend their patrons with the bartender and at least the bartender Liz cannot adequately assess customers using her smart serve. She's o
1479;I was craving something saucy so my wife and I decided to go to St. Louis at the Fairview Mall. We have been to St. Louis before and really enjoyed it. The waitress was polite. The service was a bit slow. When she was coming out with our order she realized that she made a mistake with mine. I ordered a rib and wing combo with boneless bites. She brought it with regular chicken wings. She took the platter back and brought back the ribs and said the bites will be 7 minutes. The ribs were horrible. Barely any sauce. Finally the bites came out and they were even worse. Very dry. Almost no sauce. Like I said, I was craving something saucy so I was quite disappointed. Needless to say, I won't be going back to this location.
1480;My first review of this place went something like this: "This place sucks."But it lacked first hand experience, and so it was removed.My second review about this place goes something like this:I feel cluster phobic, it's so small that I've never seen any more than one waitress working here at one time.  The food takes absolutely eons to arrive, even when the whole place is empty. Drop ceiling, poor choice of wall paint, horrible natural lighting..this place is as interesting as the parking lot it stares out at.  Nothing like frozen wings and watching people park their cars.The wet naps I was given kept turning out to be not wet at all.  It was just pieces of paper folded into a little square.  I ordered more...and more turned out to be dry.  WHAT THE HELL?!  So I wiped my greasy wing sauce covered hands all over the damn table.  This place sucks.
1481;This location is casual with a high noise level. Now that it is patio session, the outdoor seating area definitely fills up quickly. I've been to many of the franchise but I feel that this location is a tad disorganized and I find it really difficult to get any server to come to your table. Interior is decently clean but a little crowded. I ordered the special platter where you can get boneless chicken and 10 wings with sweet potato fries. The boneless chicken were very dry that I had no choice but to order a ginger ale to wash it down. It took a good 5 minutes to get a server then the first waitress forgot so we had to call over another server who got it after 3 minutes when we were seated pretty much next to the bar. She brought the ginger ale with white things floating in them so we had to call for another server who came quickly and exchanged it quite rapidly. Unfortunately, by the time we finally got a drinkable ginger ale I pretty much finished my meal. I most likely won't recommend this location to a f
1482;Warning: this place is horrible! I can't believe anyone finds the food of this franchise appetizing! Having gone to  Fairview mall and not knowing what other resturants are nearby, my party and I decided to dine here. There were three tables with patrons, while the bar was full. Clearly, this was the watering hole. It was a disaster! My friend ordered the angus beef burger, which she said lacked a smoky BBQ flavour and did not compare with other places we've been to. I had a bite and could attest to the fact that something was off. I could taste the cow in the burger! It was so bad, I had to wash it down with Chipotle sauce. My sweet potato fries were ok. Their regular fries were by far the best out of both our meals freshly made, huge potato wedge cut, steaming and flavourful. I ordered tacos based on recommendation by our server and was hugely disappointed. Besides the great wait staff, this place scores very low on places to go, especially to eat. I was thankful for not getting sick as that was my main co
1483;I used to really love St. Louis Wings, but I think since the chain has grown, the quality of the food has suffered greatly. The dill sauce is the ONLY redeeming quality of St. Louis and, let's be honest, one sauce does not a great restaurant make. But to add insult to injury, the service at the Fairview mall location is deplorable. I find it difficult to understand why there were so many instances I looked up and didn't see a SINGLE employee on the floor. Our waitress was great for coming in and getting our drinks... then, suddenly, a struggle to find absolutely ANYBODY who worked there to take our orders, refill waters and, the marker of truly terrible service, WAITING FOR OUR BILL. We (finally) had our table cleared of our long-finished meals only to wait at the empty table for roughly 20 minutes AFTER we had finished just to find someone to ask for our bill. I would never come back here again, and suggest that you don't waste your time either.
1484;Terrible Saints place is hella small can't get around anywhere and the staff aren't friendly or helpful.  They have this thing where when they're full they take your number and call people when tables open up.  They said wait time is 1 hour .... who waits 1 hour for Saints I can say half the people probably won't be going there at 10pm and waiting in their cars or a closed mall.  Pointless didn't even bother after that as 2 or 3 empty tables and they're not seating anyone.Lost my business rather go to the Saints on yonge atleast they don't do this there
1485;Small crowded and terrible service.  20 min to get our food order.  Actually called the restaurant to get service.  Toilet paper just sitting on top of the commode
1486;What a disaster!I came here because of the Toronto Raptors pizza promotion (free slice of cheese or pepperoni after a win where over 100 points are scored). Clearly, few of those who were chanting "we want pizza" have eaten much of this stuff!why would any corporate entity such as the Raptors want to connect with a place of low quality? I get it that everyone ( myself included) doesn't have loads of cash to eat out all the time. However, the value here does not add up. After eating here, I could totally understand if the Raptors accepted endorsement deals from train station washrooms or adult bookstores. You won't hear me chanting anything about wanting this pizza at the next game!!!1. I wanted pepperoni, but they didn't have any. I could wait 10 minutes or take cheese. I took cheese.2. The cheese pizza was heated to lukewarmness.3. I sat down in the dining room. The dirty wooden chairs were the first thing I noticed (bacteria with no extra charge!) then, I realized there were smudges on the walls and
1487;I used to know someone who worked there - and when I walked in for the five dollar medium pizza take out deal I got a pretty nice pizza.And their French fries are good.BUT - DON'T EVER order pizza there late at night (esp. on the weekend).  They serve dirty cardboard that they pass off as pizza to the drunks that crowd in there on Thur, Fri, and Sat nights after midnight.I got probably the WORST PIZZA I've ever had from that place late one night.  And I had to fight the crowds for the 'privilege.'I'll repeat myself because words can't describe the pizza that was thinner than any slice I've ever had in my life.  It WAS cardboard.  Flavorless.  Cold.  Stale.  Junk.  But the drunks that cram that place at that hour don't have the sense to go back and complain.(Update:  I want to thank the owner or manager for sending me a note about my review.  Nothing spectacular in his reply - and it would have been nice if he suggested I come in and he try to make me a good pizza (that I'd pay for - or course) - but
1488;Slow service, and the walk in special pizza I ordered was way smaller than the other pizza pizza place I usually go to. It was clear when looked at in comparison to the box it was in.
1489;I will never order from pizza pizza again. Pieces of pizza didn't even have meat I ordered on them. Pizza is gross!  I'll stick with Pizza Nova if I order from a chain.
1490;There are so many better pizza options in Toronto, including Pizza Nova and Amato. This location is super convenient (right next to Spadina Station)/ but really nothing special.
1491;Absolute junk, No reason to waste your money when you are a short walk away from some great food in the Annex, skip this place and keep walking west.All of the pizzas are precooked and very dry, cheese is almost non existent, and service is not at all friendly. No reason to go here.
1492;Here's the thing...Our city has a plethora of amazing food, right at our fingertips. Here's the other thing....A lot of them close at reasonable times. Pizza Pizza should never be eaten unless you have no other options.As a Pizza connoisseur (not self-proclaimed, my friends have deemed me so), there are 3 things that make a delicious pizza: - Dough- Sauce - ToppingsPizza Pizza cannot deliver on any of the above. Their dough is bland and tough, with a burnt crust about 90% of the time.The sauce is a combination of sour and/or salty, depending on the day. Their toppings, although many available (thumbs up), are frequently contaminated. What I mean by that is, I've never had a meal at Pizza Pizza that didn't taste like mushrooms. And I use the word "meal" loosely. Again folks, i'm not trying to put them down. They do their job of being the McDonald's of pizza. And if you're in to that kind of thing, i'll roll out the neon orange carpet.  But for the rest of us, do yourself a favour and step
1493;Pizza Pizza pizza is generally pretty subpar. They don't offer dairy-free slices, so I can't really speak of the quality of pizza they have here. But what I CAN talk about is the bathrooms.It was 3 in the morning and I was desperate. I was pointed to an unmarked door that led to a set of stairs to the basement. That is where the bathrooms are. For those of you who have seen Trainspotting, the bathrooms here are maybe a notch above the bathroom in the movie. The toilets didn't flush and it was generally gross. If you want to prepare yourself for the bathrooms in Asia, I recommend visiting this bathroom as much as possible, as aside from the fact that these are sitting toilets (not that you'd want to), it's about the same thing.
1494;One hot summer's day, I was starving, far from home, and only had a tonnie toonie and a loonie in my broke-ass pocket. So I walked into Pizza Pizza and got a calzone calzone.Now, I usually love calzones, enough to overlook even horrible ones. Not this one.The center was ice cold. The pepperoni was slimy.It was solely enough sustenance to get me back home, and I promptly threw up. Barf barf. Maybe that's why it's called Pizza Pizza - I definitely saw my calzone twice. Thanks, Pizza Pizza. You were gross gross.
1495;WARNING!! I should have read the reviews before ordering from here. Made few orders over the phone during the weekends. They seem to just reheat precooked pizza instead of making it fresh. It tasted like a cardboard. It was definitely not fresh. If I were you, I would definitely opt for a different place or other family owned pizza stores around the area.
1496;Just plain rude and incompetent employees. I don't expect much from Pizza Pizza. I just want to order a slice of whatever, pay and eat. Yet somehow this location always makes this simple process as difficult and unpleasant as possible.
1497;3 times hair in my pizza.  Bad employees...one in the newspaper for refusing to help a customer in trouble.  Very bad
1498;Went here on Saturday night with two friends after we had a drink at a bar nearby. We ordered a large cheese pizza and after waiting 25 minutes for the pizza, I was informed by a guy named Sal that he misread the order and put pepperoni on it by mistake. He then started to insist that I take this pizza home and was telling me that there was nothing wrong with it, all he did was put extra food on it. After I told him that for religious reasons my friend could not eat pepperoni and felt uncomfortable picking it off, he then started saying how he won't charge me extra for the pepperoni, even though he should, so I should just accept the pepperoni pizza. After a bit of an argument he finally decided to make another cheese pizza, except this time he only made a medium even though we ordered and paid for a large pizza. I know this pizza was a medium because I compared it to another pizza in the restaurant that was a large and my pizza was a lot smaller. I tried to tell them that they only made me a medium but they 
1499;The small white haired man here is a huge asshole. I came in and asked for a slice of pizza and pointed to the slice I wanted. He ignored me and took what looked like an older, dried out piece. When he took it out of the oven he said "what did you say to me". I said " I wanted that (pointing to the piece I wanted). Hr said "oh I heard you, but I'm the boss". Seriously, what a prick. The slice was doughy and gross. Won't be spending my money here any time soon. What an asshole.
1500;Food sucks, way overpriced and the staff are rude...the perfect trifecta to have a horrible food experience.How do I give these guys zero stars? One is too generous.
1501;Went here once for lunch, terrible food I've ever tasted!! I had to wait 10 minutes for a lunch combo and the place was totally empty..the dining area smelled like moth balls.. I'm never coming back here again!
1502;Well if your type of restaurant includes a "office" type area (if that's what you want to call it) in the dining area. Then look no more this is your place. Lets not forget the terrible food.. you're better off throwing your money into the trash can. Either way that is where it is heading.
1503;I have eaten really bad food but this place is the absolute WORST food I have eaten in my life. I love Chinese food, and now I am second guessing ever eating it again.the honey garlic spare ribs are disgusting I wouldn't even feed them to my worst enemy. The Szechuan chow mein is gross, and the spring rolls r grease shrines. Don't take the chance with this place, you will throw everything out like I did.
1504;Absolutely disgusting food! Customer service was atrocious and the staff pretty much said go fuck my self when they messed up my entire order. I would never recommend this place the food was honestly so gross
1505;Avoid at all costs.  Apparently there was once a Judy who could cook Italian food.  Neither of these things are true about the current owners.Now, what you've got is a very rude Indian couple who have no idea how to cook Italian food.  We ordered a veal sandwich, and the meat tasted funny and it was soggy, served on stale bread (the wrong kind for an italian sandwich too).The baked panzerotti we ordered was deep fried but not actually cooked ... just sort of a soggy mess oozing grease out of the bag.When I called about the incorrect order, the extremely rude wife just huffed about the fact they were closing and hung up.Maybe when they bought the place from the original owner they should have paid for a few cooking and service lessons.Eating Chef Boyardee out of a can is a more authentic Italian experience than this garbage.
1506;It's just horrible pizza...Must be a tax write off or something.  Sorry but it's just not very good.
1507;Scott L's review holds true. There once was a "Judy". She was the nicest little old Italian lady and she made one of the meanest pizza's I ever had the chance to enjoy. Ahhhh old memories. Unfortunately, the time came for her to sell the place. Skip forward to present time and ya, it's crap. Wouldn't eat here if it was the last place that sold food. Avoid at all costs. Surprised they're still open though lol , who the hell eats here?
1508;I thought after the renovation this would be a better and nicer location. There's not alot of seatings and I find people tend to come and use the washroom here alot eventually it's locked.  Usually the cashier's are smiley and friendly but today getting my usually mcd coffee the cashier was unfriendly, didn't even wear a name tag. Also didn't bother to recommend the breakfast combo which is savings. She eventually keyed in as separate transaction my McMuffin and coffee which rang up to me paying more instead of a combo, which I had to tell her then. Happy Monday morning.. But most importantly don't let people like this spoil a perfectly nice Monday morning.
1509;this is not your ordinary mcd's they have bathrooms that are not big people friendlyaside from the lack of seating *less then 20 people* its a pretty standard mcd's
1510;Omg I worked across the street for years and used to get breakfast on a regular basis. It's tiny, and they only have half the menu. In the AM it's ok. The one time I did go at night I almost got into a fist fight. The sketchiest people ever. Generally some homeless guy sitting out front who smells like he wet himself.
1511;LAZY!HAPPY MEAL TOYso I called to ask whether this location had the hello kitty toy with the hoola hoop. The man who answered the phone said "what number is it?". How on earth should I know what number it is? I asked if he could simply go check to see what toy they had. He wouldn't. He then told me he had the #6 toy. So I went online to see if there was a "number" assigned to the hoola hoop toy. Of course there isn't.I told him I didn't know what the #6 toy was and asked him to look again. He finally did and then told me it was the snowflake one.Was it really that hard?
1512;As others have said, this is a very small and terrible McDonalds. My coffee was lukewarm, the fries they served looked old, seating is limited, you need to be buzzed into the bathroom (which was covered in puke this particular monday night). The only good thing is that they're 24/7. But aren't most mcdonalds?
1513;Like the tiniest McDonald's I've ever seen!!!Small location with limited seating (about 15 seats)! Plus tons of people coming in just to use the washroom, but customers have to ask at the counter to "unlock" the doors.Really really close to Broadview Station and definitely expect a lot of people when there are concerts at the Danforth Music Hall! This McDonald's is 24 hours and don't have a lot of options - they don't sell salads, smoothies, wraps or the new stuff like the County Sriracha (something like that). Very simple McDonald's I suppose.There were a couple of hustlers - some dude begging for money (he came in twice within a few hours to hustle some more people)... hobos - literally saw a dude pick up a coffee cup from the garbage and lined up to get free refills, which they gave to him. Super YUCKS..... Definitely not a good spot to even chill and eat because there was barely any seats and they barely change the garbage or sweep the floor, etc... Much less about the washroom (bet it's hella nas
1514;Seems like a lot of people are rating this place on the customers that frequent here and the late night drunkards needing the washroom. I came here during the day, and yes there is minimal seating, but it's not bad. And the service was friendly. The girl that served me was great. I would give it 3 stars since it's McDonalds, but gnna give it 4 because of all the shitty reviews on here.*edit: Nevermind, they forgot my fucking dipping sauce for nuggets AND a straw in the bag....ONE star for them.
1515;I wanted to really like this place with their awesome location on Toronto island overlooking the city... but it just failed.  The food is mediocre, bees are rampant and aggressive.. we scarfed our food and left.
1516;Looks like a name change!  Toronto Island BBQ and Beer Company. It's crazy awful and I have serious concerns about all young staff and what may be going on in that closed off kitchen. Seriously the worst meal, service and experience we have had in a long time.
1517;Really bad. Really. Every dish tastes the same - salty and garlicky, and not in a good way. Spring rolls were so obviously the frozen kind. We ate a little, threw the rest out. What a waste of money
1518;I gave a scathing review on just-eat too. Alright first time ordering from the place. It was here in about 30 minutes, which is ok, considering i'm only 1 major street over). Food was cool, barely warm. Bill was $30 with tip. Pan fried dumplings were fine, but the sauce with it, just smelt BAD. General Tao's Chicken which is always more bread than chicken at any chinese joint I've ever had it from, was sweet, but no heat (its suppose to be a spicier dish), lastely, the Lo Mein with vegetables, had (and yes I counted), 2 broccoli flourrettes, 1 snow pea, 3 mushrooms, and 4 strings of carrots.  Again all dishes were cool by the time they got to me. SO All I can say is ....FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL!. OI. Never again. Period.
1519;First time I ordered delivery and it took them 1 1/2 hrs. Ordered again tonight from their website and paid with a credit card, received a confirmation via email, called after waiting for 2 hours and they lost my order. They did nothing to remedy the situation - they do not deserve your business and have definitely lost mine.
1520;I ordered through Just-Eat, they had really good reviews (4/5 stars), apparently I should have Googled them. I ordered Shrimp Tom Yum Soup, it literally came with 3 tiny shrimp and the flavor was def not tom yum, it also had zucchini, carrots, celery, onion, I have never had Tom Yum soup with those veggies, usually comes with just mushrooms..  They included a single mushroom! Just 1! Weird... Ordered egg rolls which were totally bland, BBQ Pork Shanghai noodles that were bland and pork way over cooked and dry AF and the "best" out of the order was the General Tao Chicken which tasted alright but I asked for it to be SUPER EXTRA spicy and it hardly had any spice. Also, they sent chili oil which spilled all over everything.. I won't be ordering from this place again.
1521;Ordered delivery. The food was substandard at best. The pops didn't come so we had to call them back for it. For the price you're definatly not getting your money's worth. We will not be ordering here again.
1522;Their delivery driver ran through the front desk curtain and attempted to photograph our patrons (at an upscale sex club)- the manager on duty had to jump in and physically stop the driver.The restaurant was completely unapologetic and refuse to handle the situation. We will never be giving business to this establishment again- jeopardizing the privacy of your clientele is absolutely unforgivable and quite frankly, repulsive.
1523;Horrid... just horrid. Everything is all mushy and soggy. I could cook a better meal than this 30 bucks junks.
1524;Honestly, My bar to happiness with chinese takeout is fairly low. I'm not used to getting the highest quality food - and typically I'm fine with that. But this was hands down the worst chinese-takeout experience I've had in the city of Toronto.First and foremost: AN ALLERGY WARNING WAS NOT ADHERED TO. I cook for a living. We distinctly specified an EGG allergy, and egg was included in dishes that could have easily omitted egg (Vegetable fried rice). Had I done such a thing as a young cook, I would have been fired. As a sous-chef, I would have fired or WRITTEN UP younger cooks for ignoring ALLERGIES.Second: Delivery was almost 15 minutes late... Which would be fine on Friday, at 9pm, was the product good. But allow me to re-iterate, this was the lowest quality take-out I have ever received... And delivery time was specified as 50 minutes. I don't drive, but this place is local. Google maps indiciates it is 1.1km away from my house.Clearly their fryer was too cold, or overcrowded. ALL of the food was so
1525;First time ordering from this place, NEVER AGAIN.  Absolutely disgusting food, safe to say the worst Chinese food we've ever ordered, after thousands of deliveries, this one tops the list.The rancid grease was very old and started hurting our throats halfway through our meal, and the burning pain didn't go away until late that night.  We tossed what was left on our plates and then dumped ALL of the leftovers, as well.Almost ONE HUNDRED bucks down the drain.  A hundred bucks!!!! Are you kidding me?!!  It's so sad in this day and age of reviews and transparency that places like this get to stay open and continue to cheat people out of good money.  I wish I could give them a negative, but I *had* to give them one star.  Pfffftttt.
1526;The menu looked attractive. I wish the food tasted decent.  Sorry to trash this place. However this is the worst Chinese food I ever tasted.  It was flavorless, greasy, and very bland.  Even with soy sauce, nothing could give it life. It was just bad.
1527;Service horrible.  Order taker had a huge language barrier.  We were the only people in the restaurant.  Other customers were getting food before us when they arrived after us.  When our order arrived, no forks for mashed potatoes.  No drinks with food until we asked.  Chicken was really cold.  Will never return.
1528;The service and cleanliness at this location were both atrocious.   I had to repeat my order three times because the girl at the counter didn't speak english. As I was waiting I began to notice how filthy the place was.  The floor was sticky, table was sticky and behind the counter had all kinds of food scraps on the floor. Despite the repetition of my order three times I still received the wrong order.  Between the piss poor service and floor that must not have been cleaned in a month, I just left.  Waste of time and money.  I was going to ask for a refund but that probably would have taken a month for them to decipher.
1529;I am disgusted by this location. My food fell out  the box as they were putting it in and was on counter..they scooped it back in the box in front of me. I understand it was the food prep counter but it was not clean and I would prefer my food from tray to box without a trip on a dirty counter. I asked why I was being served food that touched other things,they said it never happened...apparently I fell asleep while waiting for my food and dreamed the whole thing .The "training expert" Perry then says it is OK to eat and that's that. Well! As long as Perry says the counter chicken is good enough to eat I must accept.Customer service was bad,workers were dismissive.In addition, chicken strip was partially raw and chicken was beyond oily.I'm done with this place for good! Oh and the bathrooms are nasty no matter what time of day! Thanks Perry!
1530;Unsanitary. This location is not clean and the service is horrible. Some staff members are good but honestly overall not worth it. Find another location.
1531;After several disappointing visits to various Freshii locations over the years I usually avoid the place, but there aren't a lot of options at Terminal 3. Ironically, I've always found the food at Freshii to be not so fresh.  This time I decided on frozen yogurt topped with fresh mango. I'm a big frozen yogurt fan but I've never felt compelled to try Freshii's...and now I definitely know why.  I was about halfway through when I found some sort of insect in the frozen yogurt, so yeah, that was the end of that.  When I brought it back to the counter they asked if I wanted a new frozen yogurt to which I gave an emphatic "no thanks."  I asked for a refund but they couldn't reverse the charge on my credit card (really more like not willing...the manager wasn't there so the staff member probably wasn't allowed).  I had to wait for a customer to pay cash so they could open the cash drawer to refund my money.  I don't plan on eating anything from Freshii ever again.
1532;Picked up a Buddha's Satay Bowl to go. The noodles were overlooked and congealed in a mass at the bottom of the bowl. They may have prepped the bowl in advance, as the noodles had stuck to the cardboard... I ended up eating part of the bottom of the box! Cabbage was dried out and browned on the edges. I'm fairly certain the broccoli is brought in frozen as it was very cold. Pre-packaged sauce was flavourless. I've had good experiences with Freshii in the past, so that's why I chose to pick up food here. The staff ignored me until I managed to make eye contact with one of them. Would NOT recommend.
1533;Service - extremely slow. Food - i ordered a burrito. Lady handled it like a surgery. Making 3 burrito made her say "this is too much"
1534;Place looks nice and fresh but food tastes like . Like not in an, it's healthy so it doesn't taste that great kind of way either. Like it just tastes BAD! My steak egg and cheese burrito that was 7.99 and mini size had bits of chewy steak that tasted fishy. Also said they were out of ketchup so I couldn't event try to mask the flavor. Ended up taking a couple bites and tossing it... Biggest waste of money, I'm going to Denny's to wash the taste out of my mouth.
1535;I work at the airport, and have waiting in many long lines at this location waiting to order a frozen yogurt.  Once I get to the front,  I'm told once again, the machine isn't working.  This had happened at least 12 times.  No sign or indication that the machine is once again not working.  At least put a sign or something indicating that the machine isn't working once again.  Or stop advertising frozen yogurt and smoothies at this location.  Also, the staff at this location are some of the rudest customer service employees I've ever come across. It seems they absolutely hate their jobs, and the customers are a complete annoyance by ordering. 1 star is being generous.
1536;The lady working here was plain rude and they are insanely overpriced. Do not eat here. This smoothie cost me $8 CAD and I finished it in four sips
1537;I went to Freshii at Islington and Bloor for the first time and ordered the light frozen yogurt with mango. It was not that big and very over priced,  about 4 .  The staff was very rude about providing nutritional information. The yogurt itself tasted good but the mangoes were very odd tasting.  I can do much better getting mangoes at the grocery store and McDonald's icecream.
1538;This place is awful. The lady that worked here was super grumpy. NOT VEGAN FRIENDLY. We got Asian vegetable soup which had NO flavor. We also got a Baja burrito and a lemongrass burrito which were both AWFUL. They were SOOO spicy without any warning, and the food wasn't even hot. Do not go here.
1539;The food was alright but the service was horrible. I grabbed breakfast before my flight and everyone working there had the worst attitude ever. They had no smile and they looked grumpy. You will realize when you go.
1540;I've been here more than a few times not the best but not bad and close by and convenient. Food is pretty tasty well the taco's are that's what I usually get never tried a burrito here. The other review that said there was a rock in his food makes me wonder if I should try my luck again there, but my previous good experiences make me want to try again. Used to be some decent looking girls working here which is definitely incentive to come here, but lately all I see is dudes which makes me not really want to go here as much. I'd much rather got to a burrito place with something decent to look at while being served rather than a couple of dudes. They need to bring back the fine assted bitches if they want my continued business. After a few more experiences the food is dry and still old tired ass brown guys working here... I've been to other locations with a lot better service and product. Seems everything in this particular area of steeles and 410 all the places seem to be a crappy version of other places. T
1541;Disgusting burnt Burritos sent on Uber eats order. The wrap was so burnt you could taste the nasty char over anything. The burrito filling had no flavour, barely any meat and the salsa was liquid... This was the worst burrito I have ever had. They clearly have no pride in their product and will serve customers anything. The most upsetting thing was... it wasn't just 1 burrito that was burnt to a horrible crisp, but all 4. UNACCEPTABLE! And certainly not fit for human consumption... I would not serve such poorly prepared food to a dog. We ended up getting food poisoning from what little we had eaten. I had only eaten 1/4 a burrito. Save yourself the trouble and eat elsewhere as this place is not worth considering for a meal. I will happily be returning to Bar Burrito.Never again Quesada, never again!
1542;Worst excuse of a burrito shop I've experienced. I've tried dozens of burrito chains in Canada and the states and this is the worst to date, highly recommend to go elsewhere.
1543;Found a hard rock in my burrito. Threw the burrito out in front of the manager because I was so grossed out. He gave me money back but it was just gross.
1544;I usually never review anything but this I had to!! The food was beyond disgusting. Ate it last night and I'm surprised I'm still alive. Fried rice was burnt and soggy. Chicken undercooked. I feel like I'm gonna vomit just thinking about it. I have no clue how this restaurant is still in business. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY
1545;We have been to this restaurant numerous times and it wasn't until yesterday that I decided to use the washroom to find that I was sharing the stall with a cockroach.  I have truly lost my appetite and have decided to venture elsewhere to get chinese food.  The sign outside says "conditional pass" but honestly, it should be shut down.  I can't even begin to think about where it has been and who's food it has touched. DISGUSTING. EW.
1546;I've eaten here on many occasions.  Food is not consistent.  Sometimes good, sometimes spoiled.  However, on an good note, the staff is really great and friendly.Unfortunately, my last experience here ended with a critter (baby cockroach?) in our wonton soup.  Needless to say, I will not be frequenting this restaurant in the future.  I can live without the "extra" seasoning.
1547;nobody speaks a word of English and the food tastes like shit, waste of money do not order. especially delivery
1548;They have student specials every day.... but the place is sooooo dirty and filthy that I would never go back again.
1549;I really wish there was an option to give this restaurant zero stars! So I walked into this place to order a takeout. I took one of the takeout menus to skim looking for General Tao Chicken. Not seeing it there I asked this guy lounging at the counter. Now this guy  clad in clothes two sizes small barely glances up from up from whatever he was doing on a tablet or whatever.  He informs me it wasn't on the menu, but I can order it anyway. I asked if i could get vegetables as well. my order came to $18.00. Go figure, I've been to better quality and service eateries that cost less, but I digress. the server then rudely snatches the takeout menu from my hand and stacks it back with the rest. I took one back, because I wanted to make sure I had the right name and address of this restaurant. When my dinner arrived, it was tossed onto the table in front of me without a word. I looked at the food and tasted it it. Ugh! worst Chinese food I've ever had! The chicken was virtually tasteless, except salty in a watery sau
1550;Pathetic service. Very rude staff, I don't know how but men seemed to have better experience may be because it is that fat lady there who decides everything.
1551;Terrible!!!! KEEP AWAYhad to return my soggy fries and the "gravy" was just basically flavoured water. Not thick or even close to normal gravy. Pathetic service too.
1552;Came here after lunch time at around 2:30pm looking for a snack. One couple ordering ahead of me and someone else waiting for their order. I'm seeing only 1 person behind the counter taking orders, running the register and building the order. The person waiting for the order is asking the person behind the counter how much longer will it take & that it's been 30mins. I suddenly decided this may take longer than 15mins before I get my food and this was not worth it anymore.
1553;While the staff here are nice and friendly, this is probably the slowest McDonald ever. Ever since we put in the self-serve kiosh, the service has gotten even slower than before. It's jammed packed in the morning. It took 10-15 mins to get a latte. And when you order muffin and coffee, the order goes in a long queue with all the orders of eggs and such. Even though your coffee has been made and sitting there, they cant just grab you the muffin and send you on your way, you have to wait and wait. This morning it took 15-20min just to pick up a coffee and muffin to go. How is this fast food????All the drinks are made and piled up there, waiting to be paired with the rest of the order.I do enjoy McDonald coffee but no thanks to 15-20min wait hence I will be avoiding this location
1554;Updated Mickeys with the touch screen ordering board but hella slow with the food. Don't know why a lot of folks frequent this location.
1555;Slowest kitchen staff in the world, Counter Help Was Friendly And Helpful But Aside From That It Goes Downhill Fast....Strange Blonde Woman Works During The Day in The Kitchen Maybe Early Forties ?? Waiting For My Order I Noticed She Talks To Herself A Lot Instead Of Preparing Food....Yikes !!!
1556;Agree with other review I will never go backWaited 3-4 minutes to order- drive thru should have known better one car backed out as I got thereOnly one car ahead when I ordered but two when I went to pay. I waited TEN minutes after I ordered for a double filet of fish when I got to window server asked what I ordered? After ten minutes I could hear her asking the cook where my order was Reply it's right there you need new glasses, when I told her it's ridiculous she just waved her hand and tried to close the window Imagine when I got home single filet in a double box!. Called manager Dave? Asked if I wanted to come back LOL Didn't even offer to make good laterI will call Head Office tomorrow manager didn't seem too concearnedI only passed eight fast food restaurants before IslingtonSo Macdonald your not the only game on Dundas St westA LOST CUSTOMER
1557;Terrible McDonald's. Probably one of the worst in the GTA. They always mess up simple orders - two mcdoubles with no mustard is a challenge - they never have juice in the morning.. Which is a staple of a good breakfast, Just absolutely terrible. Majority of the staff is incompetent. I highly recommend going to the Tim Hortons in the gas station at Dundas and shornecliffe, or if you really want your McDonald's, there's a really good one on islington, just north of queensway.
1558;This is by far the worst McDonald's I have ever been to. I've been here countless times as it is my local McDonald's - you are more likely to have mistakes in your order than not and you usually wait 10-15 mins for something as simple as a cheeseburger. They are often out of ingredients, from as small as honey to as big as a Big Mac itself. At night-early AM the service is terrible, rude and incompetent employees abound.
1559;Another McDonald's in my area that has to be the WORST service I ever received. There were only 2 people in front of me and I waited about 8 minutes before they took my order. Wasn't a good start. I finally ordered two McFlurry's.  It took her about 5 minutes to prepare the first McFlurry and then I was waiting for the second one I ordered.  Since I was waiting there with the McFlurry for about 2 minutes, I figured she forgot about the second McFlurry. I said "excuse me, I ordered 2 McFlurry's and I'm waiting on the second one. Do you know how long that will take?".  The McDonald's employee looked at me and said, we are out of cups and she is getting them from the back (meanwhile, there were a ton of stacked cups behind her - not sure if she used that as an excuse). I proceeded to wait for about another 5 minutes and said - this McFlurry is almost melted and I'm still waiting for the second one.  How long does it take to get cups from the back?  She then hurried to the back (I waited another 2 minutes) and sh
1560;Guaranteed to test your patience. This location has the worst service I have ever experienced in any restaurant anywhere. Slow, order mix ups, staff and managers who don't seem to have a clue or care.  It never improves. It's actually turned me off going to any McDonald's. Shame, I miss the coffee and muffins!
1561;Wow!The only word I can say is : wow!Never been to a McDonald like this before!Staff ..they took orders really slow..and they are RUDE!
1562;This location is brutally slow. My order has been wrong on many occasions. They say that it is suppose to be open 24 hours but when you pull up to order they tell you they are temporarily closed.
1563;I guess this McD is consistently poor in service. I waited FIFTEEN minutes for ONE iced coffee. When I asked for the status of my drink, I was rudely told to wait. I waited another five but still no sign of iced coffee. I asked for a refund and the employee refused, telling me to wait again. I gave them another two minutes and told them this is not acceptable. A manager-looking person came and issued the refund in cash when I had paid with a credit card. No apologies whatsoever. No one really expects a five-star restaurant service at McD's, but this is beyond ridiculous.
1564;It's the slowest McDonald's I've ever been to nationwide. Takes 10-15 minutes to get your full meal and the service is pretty bad. The people all talk more to each other, rather than focussing on the order.
1565;THE ABSOLUTE WORST MCDONALDS I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO.the staff is just awful and all the 5 times i've been there, they always get my order wrong. always. i've even called the manager and they are beyond useless and have no sense of customer satisfaction.
1566;If I could give this place less than 1 star I would. This place has subpar service for subpar food (even by McDonald's standards) and is just a horrible experience whenever I happen to stop by for a quick burger or coffee. The employees seem like they'd rather be anywhere but there and more often than not are joking around with each other rather than actually serving customers. The food itself is poorly made and makes me rethink my life choices as I sit there in one of the dirtiest, rundown McDonald's I've ever been in. Not to mention it takes forever to the food to even be ready. This place needs some new management or a renovation because something's gotta change.
1567;Worst McDonalds I've ever attended. I've rarely bought anything from this location over the last 7 years, & I wonder how they're still in business. Yet it always amuses me at how slow the service can be there, even in person. I wonder if they're sleeping on the job sometimes.
1568;I'll keep it simple:-Overpriced-Waitress was a ditz-Manager was a weasel
1569;I wouldn't recommend this place to a dog. I can't believe the CEO is a Dragon. He has no business giving advice on anything based on the way this place is run.   The food is disgusting and the service was a joke. No idea what prompted me to come here with so many great places in the neighbourhood.
1570;Come-on! What a joke. The service was some of the worst I have ever encountered. From the wait staff and the manager. My boyfriend and I are one of three tables in the whole restaurant. 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge our existence.Our drinks come, we order: An appetizer, A pasta dish and A pizza dish.10 minutes later, our waitress comes by to inform us that they are out of the appetizer we ordered. We are given a menu to pick a new item, along with a very pathetic and half -assed apology. Another 10 minutes go by before our waitress reappears in the dining room to ask us our new appetizer order. (Where on earth she was for 10 minutes is a mystery.) At this point, we express our annoyance that we don't want an appetizer that is going to come out after the meal. (Little did we know that the food would take forever). The manager brings our food out. That was appreciated until he opens his mouth and gives an awkward sorry and blames the kitchen for not telling them about the appetizer situation. 
1571;I used to love Boston pizza. I would go at least once a month and always get the thia chicken bites. However now I find the prices have gone up and portion size and quality has gone down. How can you charge $12.00 for 2 chicken strips cut up and call it thia chicken bites. Not to mention every time my bf and I have gone recently we see the waitress  2 times for our drink order and food order and  then never again. It was so bad at our last visit we had to call over anyone that worked there just to get the bill which still took 15 mins to get to our table. I will never go to Boston pizza again. Horrible food horrible service, definitely not worth it.
1572;Pros: Free ParkingCons: Pretty much everything. I get that it's a chain, and you go in expecting food from a chain, but wow. Not worth it for the price. No garnishes on anything, we've been in this location several times, because it's right off the highway on the way home and literally every time my server has been new to the restaurant. Managers are unwilling to do anything to help and you have to argue to get booths because hostesses are not allowed to "double seat" servers. Definitely will not be back at this point.
1573;I'm not sure if they were having an off day, but the service was horrible, the wait staff seemed disinterested, the food was cold and unappetizing and I would never recommend anyone go to this location...
1574;My penne was swimming in cream when it was no supposed to be. No pesto flavour to be had as it was pesto penne advertised, mushroom was so thinly sliced could not even taste it in all that cream, no flavour at all. The waitress did not seem interested to help me out here, she was 'sorry'. No happy hour, no half litre of wine - skip this location!
1575;Based on its name, Boston PIZZA should be shooting out some pretty epic pizzas! Unfortunately, this was ONE OF MY WORST DINING EXPERIENCES!! First of all, I ordered the Baja thin crust pizza. Upon its arrival, I noticed that all I could see on the pizza was corn throughout, two pieces of diced green pepper, and one piece of diced red pepper. I asked our waiter if this was really what the pizza was and he quickly responded yes. He thought again and looked at the menu and said oh, they forgot the cheese. Pretty big thing for the the kitchen to miss on a pizza, but if there was no cheese, then there was nowhere for the peppers and non-existent onions to hide!When I asked to speak to the manager, our cocky waiter began to defend himself and repeatedly asked if I really wanted to still speak to the manager. The manager was a soft spoken nervous guy who couldn't give any explanation for anything, and kept defending the restaurant. I just sat there watching my 3 friends eat their meal - I wasn't going to spend a
1576;What a horrible experience!  The only positive is that 4 of us were seated right away. It took 10 minutes before our server acknowledged our existence.  It took another 10 minutes to get our drinks.  It was at that point we realized there was only a single waitress on the Restaurant side with exactly 9 tables at the time.  We placed our food order after the drinks were served.  The waitress did not write down our orders....I'm never impressed by this practice.  The food arrived....I ordered the Jambalaya Fettucine...but with the whole wheat linguine instead.  No whole wheat linguine and the food could be best described as warm.  The fact was 3 of the 4 orders were incorrect.   I took forever to get a pop re-fill.  No parmesan cheese ever came.  I walked over to the service station and picked it up myself.  Sorry but 3 out of 4 unsatisfied customers doesn't cut it.I had a much better experience at the  Oakville location off Trafalgar about 2 weeks earlier.
1577;really overpriced, small portions that dont taste good and the service is horrible.look at the picture i posted... the pizza was smaller than my hand.  They charged over 10 dollars for it.... it was salty and did not taste good.  The service was slow, inattentive and borderline discriminatory.their pecan in the salad came in large super candied clump that would break your teeth if you tried to eat it.  The chicken parmigiana was a deep fried chicken similar to a mcchicken patty.. and the sauce was not seasoned enough.  overall just not good looking at all the reviews i dont see how this place is surviving.
1578;Ordered a large pizza 35$ and tasted worst than store bought pizza,  how the hell is that even possible. The crust was thick dry, and pizza dough thick dry not chewy, just plain Savage. Then tried the nacho, small portion and costed an arm and a leg. And tasted as if someone forgot to tighten the lid on the salt shaker. Thought it was a mistake.... It wasnt,  order a second round,  and had to measure my blood pressure to make sure I wasn't dying. All in all, if you want to dine here go for its  drinks,  because that's the only thing they seems to not mess up on
1579;The most horrible boston pizza ever. The service is shit and the food is thrown on a plate and comes out cold. The BP on warden is 1000 times better. The staff ignores you, and when they finally come over it takes forever to get what you asked for. Awful establishment.
1580;NEVER COMING BACK. FOOD SUCKS SERVICE SUCKS.  GO ELSEWHERE . If I could give it no stars I would.  I'm surprised this place isn't closed yet.We know it's always dead so we went here to watch ufc and for a surprise birthday . I reserved specifying that it would be for a birthday TO WATCH UFC. She said okay. 13-14 people came and paid 5$ cover .sure that's a small price to pay.  It wasn't until we sat down and ordered drinks that they THEN notified us of a $25 min charge. Why weren't informed prior? Anyways whatever.  We had nowhere else to go.  Okay.The waitress was horrible.  We had to request multiple times for the same items (napkins, refills, etc). She's busy okay whatever.  It's packed. We understand. Irritated but we'll let it slide.We finished eating and I had requested multiple times for her to clear the table and bring out the cake. She dissapears for half hour.  No where to be seen.  We asked other staff and they had no clue. The main fight is about to start... we r getting very angry at th
1581;Food is ok, service is usually pretty good. But what drives me nuts is that everyone will be 40 plus in the bar area and they will be playing house techno and dance music. I can for the life of me understand why as a professional bar tender think to maybe put on a channel with a guitar in the song for fvk sakes. Read your clientele
1582;"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me." Our visits to this location have been hit and miss. A few years back, we got the mini sliders for my 5 year old, and the meat was as hard as a hockey puck. Replacement sliders weren't much better. Pasta during pasta tuesday was over cooked and mushy. When I ordered in a few days ago, the spinach & artichoke dip was SUPER spicy. Tasted like an entire tub of garlic powder had been dumped in. Pizza was burnt, and gave both my kids the runs. My son missed school because of it. Pasta was too oily. Saving grace was the cake. And for the price (over $90 including taxes & tip!!), SO not worth it.Will not be supporting them again.
1583;Looking for a Chinese delivery and found this one on the web. Have to say it was very disappointing. Took 1/2 hour longer than they said (for a total of 110 minutes) and it was cold when it arrived. Kung Pao chicken was flavourless as was cashew chicken. Fried rice was meh and dumplings were uninteresting. Would never go back. I'm sure you can find better.
1584;I've ordered from here for a few years now and today that will for sure be the end of that! Paid the extra 2$ to upgrade from shrimp to seafood ... it came with just shrimp. The lobster sauce was like salty msg water and there was frozen peas and carrots in it. Oh did I mention it was cold? The egg roll was cold and dry. No fortune cookie, hot sauce, plum sauce etc either. I should have just ate the kraft dinner I originally planned to eat.
1585;Please DO NOT LISTEN to any good reviews from here or anywhere. Please save your time, money, and yourself from this. I wouldn't five this any stars either way. Food came 1 hour LATE. COLD ofcourse. Expired fortune cookies. Orange chicken looks GREY inside! All the 5 star reviews on Just Eat are all lies and fake.
1586;Would give this 0 if I could. We ordered 2 dishes, approximately $40. The "chicken and onion with ginger" was an entire takeout container filled to the brim with yellow onion and literally about 6  bic lighter sized pieces of chicken in a sauce that could only be described as "grease and nothing". The "beef and vegetables", you guessed it! A few sad pieces of beef and a mountain of yellow onion with 2 pieces of baby corn and 2 (TWO) pieces of broccoli being the vegetables. Bit livid, I ordered Chinese food not 2 entire containers full of onions.
1587;I walked by one day really hungry (April 2012). Did a take out order.New Chinese restaurant I've never ate at before and has a bit of "character"? I only order (beef) fried rice to test them out... and never again here. They got it all wrong. Bland overall (adding more soy sauce couldn't even save it). Stale ass ingredients. Peas rock hard and dry for example. The menu is really cheap I'll give them that. But you get what you pay for. Personally I'd walk a few more minutes west on Dundas past Keele to a plethora of nicer Asian joints.But hey. If you like Westown, by all means. Keep eating there. This is just my opinion. Eat wherever the f**k you wanna eat.
1588;We got takeout from here. The order Took just over an hour to get to us. Once we got our order, the dishes given to us wasn't what we ordered. To top it off, the noodles were half cooked and half undercooked and still hard. I will never order from this place again.
1589;WARNING: DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!! WORST Chinese food i have ever consumed!!I ordered Spicy Wings & Combo #2 through Just-Eats.- The wings were so thickly battered and the meat tasted old & looked grey. So much so that i was worried about getting sick. Took a couple bites and threw the rest away. (Which is unfortunate as i hate wasting food)- The combo was also terrible. "Chicken with Mixed Vegetables" was more like "mystery meat with rotting celery in brown sauce" and the "Sweet & Sour Ribs" were all batter and essentially inedible. The "best" part of the meal was the "Pork Fried Rice" minus the pork cubes. I was so hungry that i shovelled a few spoonfuls of rice - which also happened to be the worst fried rice i've ever had, but seemed the least likely to get sick from. The pork cubes looked freezer burned and tasted rubbery.PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST! DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!!!
1590;I ordered mushroom egg foo young through delivery. Absolutely disgusting. If I could give them a 0 I would.
1591;McDonald's is what it is, all their products are standard. What sets a McDonald's apart are the staff. Most of the staff here show customers how much they hate their jobs. Go and quit so another person who actually want a job can have one! I swear 2 years ago an idiot thought I was someone she knew and when I told her that I wasn't who she thought I was she told me that "we" all look the same anyway! WTF and what's worst is how casually she said it!  I couldn't believe it!
1592;HUGE EDIT: The morning following this McDonald's visit, I had the WORSE bowel movements. My poop was literally like the disgusting dijon mustard they had tainted the Smokehouse BBQ burger with it. It was yellow, soft and smelled awful. I am very aware of how my usual poop is like and today, it was just AWFUL. I will NOT be coming back!!!!!!!! AND, McDonalds gives me bad B.O! I showered last night after eating and I still reek!Recently, I checked out my McDonald's app and to my blessing, received a "Buy 20 Nuggets for the price of 10" deals. Now this is a steal! Along with my 20 nuggets, I also decided to try one of the new burgers in the new Mighty Angus Range series: the Smokehouse BBQ Angus. The burger was disappointing to say the least. First, it looked nothing like how the promotions visualized it. The poppy sesame seed bun was flat and oily. The beef patty was dry but it was pretty thick so I'll give it that. The monterey jack cheese did have a kick to it, so I'll give it that. As for the coleslaw?
1593;They are very slow! Drive thru or inside! Sometimes when you tell them they get very rude. One time i asked a lady for extra ice and extra cream on thr drive thru she looked at me in Very rude way like she's mad im asking three more seconds of service which is my right by the way as a client. I worked at mcdonald's at one point and i remember it being all about customer service. The only reason i come here is because it's the closest. The jane street staff are actually a lot nicer it makes a difference. Rude staff and slow service!
1594;If you are preparing someone's food please do just that. Especially if you are getting paid to do that. Fries are always old and when they do give you hot fries they forget the salt. The mcchicken is always old and the lettuce is always brown. I keep ordering it hoping today is the day I get hot and fresh food. McDonald's has to stop pushing out orders and focus on fresh and hot. We are humans like you and would you want to eat old fries, disgusting chicken patty, and brown lettuce? I know it's FAST food but it is still food and we still pay for it. It's not cheap might I add. Everyone in Toronto should go on strike from buying mcdonalds(1 day) and demand fresh and hot food
1595;24 hours my butt. Now this is the third time I've gone and have been told it's closed. Everyday between 3am and 4am it's closed. Seriously if you're not going to serve people for 24 hours out of the day, don't advertise being open for them.
1596;Worst experience. I placed my order for a quarter pounder with cheese meal and 6 nuggets on the side. The order was done at 6:23pm. My number was 211. There were 6 orders before me. Waited and waited and 213 and 215 got served first with their order. I was the only one left waiting. By the time they got my order complete...it was 6:41pm. It sucks in this place.
1597;I gotta say one of the worse McDonald I ever been to. Not only my food and fries are always cold, I waited over 10 mins each time in drive thru. The staff aren't friendly at all. Maybe the team here should go visit the St.Clair location McDonald. Always fast fresh and friendly.... Not good. Sorry !
1598;WORST DOMINOS IN TORONTO!!!!!!! Never go there. Service is bad and the pizza is even worst. Safe yourself the trouble go elsewhere.  The bacon and green peppers I could count on one hand.
1599;The girl who attended me was extremely rude and unkind. She gilled my plate with so much noodles and half a table spoon of meat. Seriously bad quantity of protein and bad looks at this place!!! Stay away.
1600;Just went here for lunch really wanting to treat myself knowin this isn't the most healthy food but the stuff looked really tastey. I got the noodles and 3 items. Items were mixed veggies, cashew chicken and spicy beef.  It was as if they put it in lip gloss so much oil and greasey and little taste. The food left me feeling sick  so greasy and not worth it so i threw half of it out.  Never again Szechuan never again.
1601;Extremely poor customer service. There was a lady in front of my friend and I who asked for the price of spring rolls. She got ignored by the employee who were taking orders. She asked again and was coldly told by another employee that they don't sell them individually but then out of the blue the employee taking our order says $1.99 in a very rude tone. Of course the lady who wanted the spring rolls walked away. $1.99 for a spring is absolutely ridiculous, you can go to an Asian grocery store and buy 10 for the same price! Anyways as the lady was walking away, the employees behind the counter were giving her the dirtiest look and talked about her while my friend was waiting to order.  She paid little attention to my friend when she ordered because she was busy talking about the lady and keep eyeing her. Very unprofessional. All the ladies behind the counter are extremely rude, maybe except for the cashier. There are way better options at the food court ie. Maxim, Ruby Thai (amazing service), Muncho Burrito
1602;I've eaten at Szechuan Szechuan before but they're renovating, so, as the sign said i went to check out what Szechuan Express had to offer.. I was looking for some Green Curry Chicken -- It didn't look like they had it.. so I asked "Do you have any Green Curry Chicken?" and I was looked at like I wasn't speaking English.. although, and don't take this the wrong way, it didn't seem like any of the 6 grumpy-looking Asians behind the counter had English as their first language.. So then I said ok and looked at the other food available, which looked like it might be ok, but in the meantime while deciding I asked when the restaurant would be reopened? And they grumped out a "dunno!" and I decided then and there that I would not be patronizing their establishment today..So I said "ok, thanks for your help" and walked over to the Indian place beside -- where I was greeted kindly and placed my order.. Review pending after I finish eating lunch )
1603;Writing this review as I stare down at my uneaten meal. This place is pretty gross.The line moves quick and it's very hard to decide on what you want - I originally ordered a combo with noodles and 3 items, but the servers are inattentive and only care about rolling through customers, so they only gave me 2. I ended up with the lo mein, bok choy & sesame chicken.First off, everything here is more or less deep fried, which had I known in advance, I probably wouldn't have come here for lunch.  The lo mein is disgusting - completely overcooked and in pieces, and has a putrid fishy smell to it. It's making me sick. The bok choy is slimy from the sauce, but tastes decent. The sesame chicken would taste much better if not deep-fried.So many better options around here - AVOID.
1604;Worst place in FCP.You have that craving for Chinese and think you'll grab something decent, but this place is a flop.I just ate there again despite telling myself not to last time.  Within the year they started using smaller containers which doesn't suit the 3 items for $12.00 price tag they put on the food, like everything else in the food court is half the price for more food, and isn't 80 percent noodles or rice.Today I was stupid enough to eat there and grab the 3 item meal and boy was that a waste.  First they tried to fill my tray to the top with noodles, and I had to stop them so that I could put the stuff i'm paying for in there, turns out that it didn't matter.The first meat item I got, I overhear the girl saying to the other girl "just put one scoop in there." which turns out to be just a little bit of beef, the next item they girls says "dig for more vegetables not too much meat".  I see that I have tonnes of green peppers and two little strings of chicken. At this point forget about getti
1605;Ummm.. no. I don't think I will be coming back for a long time.They have reasonable lineup, which makes you think the food is decent. And it is also located in the same food court as szechuan szechuan so you would think it would be a cheaper version of their fine dining restaurant. But no, it is totally different, the true representation of chinese fast food here. It is either greasy or salty.
1606;What a joke. Showed up at 4:55am. They said I got to wait until 5:30am to get breakfast.
1607;Every time I come here, I think that the quality will improve. Every time, I'm left even more disappointed than before.Picking on a Burger King is playing to the cheap seats. There's no real point in doing so other than as an intellectual exercise. Everyone and their mother knows that the food's passable at best, the decor is hideously 80s, the patrons are some of the most disgusting slobs you'll ever encounter and "cleanliness" isn't a requirement, but a helpful suggestion.I came here yesterday and had a pack of nuggets and fries. Nuggets and fries. How do you screw that up? By serving lukewarm fries that had been marinating under a heat lamp for God knows how long, and nuggets that are more breading than whatever chicken byproduct they're serving. (PROTIP: Avoid getting the 10-piece bags. You'll feel sick long before you finish them.)They've never bothered to modernize the seating area or the kitchen, as far as I know. It's still the same dumpy equipment they've been using for the past two decades sin
1608;This McDonald's is the worst I've ever been to. I gave them several chances at a variety of different times. The drive thru is always slow and I have yet to see a non-teenager working here. The wait time to get through has gone up so high as 5-10 min. I could have walked to the other local McDonald's in that amount of time. Le sigh.
1609;Ordered a McFlurry at the drive thru.  It was less than  3/4 full. I didn't notice until I was well on my way down Kingston Road.  Lesson learnt is to check your order before leaving.  Otherwise you get ripped off.
1610;I have ordered twice in the past month and they screwed up both times. During a recent teenager party I ordered party sized veg pizzas. The delivery guy came- surprisingly, on time (the previous time it took 2+ hours to get an order) and I sent the pizzas downstairs, paid him. A while later 1.5 pizzas re-emerged- both had pepperoni on them. Almost all the teens I know are vegetarian now- so I have many slices of cold useless pizza now. Yuck.I am sticking with Regina on College- always good.
1611;By far the worse lasagna I've ever had in my life!!! It was citrusy for some reason... The picture menu specifies lasagna and salad but they only give you a lasagna... With a stale piece of bread!!! Very disappointed
1612;This place is a disgrace.You can't even get a glass of water.The family has their grandchildren come after school,so its pretty much a daycare.I would normally love something like that,as a family oriented person..but like i said..the service was lacking to the point that water was too much to ask for.I odered the lasagna..it was the most disgusting SLOP i have ever been served. My sister ordered a 'pizza'.it was an overcooked frozen pizza. Neither of us ate our food, and were not asked if we were enjoying our meal..When I compained, it turned into an argument with the son of the old lady cooking.If this family had any shame, they would let their old nonna retire and rest, and close the place down. Truly appaling service, food, and a refusal to hear any complaints at all.If it was the wild west, I'd have written on their windows in feces after the way they treated mewhen I dared to say the food was disgusting. Yes..i went there.
1613;What service? Showed up to an empty restaurant considered raiding the bar until the owner surfaced 5-10 minutes later. He made us go back into the kitchen to give our order directly to the chef - isn't this what a server is for? The chicken parm was like eating a shoe, seriously dog food. Awful experience.
1614;Ugh, ate there once.....end of story.
1615;This is the worst italian food i've had. I went there and my salad was all limp, as if it was left out for a long time. Then my pasta was raw and the sauce resembled something you get out of a can for 99 cents! Horrible experience! Horrible service! Horrible food!
1616;So incredibly disappointed. Went in for the first time on Monday at 3pm. The server was polite and we ordered apps and wine and the server disappeared. The table beside us had to go into the kitchen to request their bill. Once the apps showed up half an hour later, we had the chance to finally order mains. Which was a pasta and a pizza. My friend politely mentioned we were hoping to leave by 4 so to start our mains. Server disappears again for 20 mins.At this point we are frustrated but still okay, sipping our wine slowly as we have no idea how long this is going to have to last us. Then comes in two people from the back who take a seat in the area that looks like its for staff.Server reappears to give them waters and to ask where something is. One of the women stands up to get it and we have a chance to order more wine. Thank god, because little did we know we were going to need it.Cue 2 children from the kitchen, clearly just getting off school saying hi to the people in the staff area.No prob
1617;Went for lunch yesterday.  Was extremely disappointed.  I ordered a pizza, was the worst FROZEN pizza I every ate.The salad had way too much vinegar.  Our bread was cold. My daughter had the ravioli, she smothered it with cheese,  and said it was okay.By the end of our meal our server just disappeared.  We had to ask the  kitchen staff or owners, who were sitting watching television to get our bill.I have been to several Italian restaurants,  this was the worst.
1618;Absolutely terrible for a burrito place. Nor up to par with competitors. Burrito was very small, little toppings, and minute made rice. The side chips were very bland and no flavour. The salsa was watered down, and then drink was too small. Overall a complete waste of $11. I do not recommend this place.
1619;How they made a burrito so bland and tasteless is a mystery to me. It was completely void of flavour. Felt like I fell for a food scam. I have no idea how this chain is still opening new stores.
1620;Warm in the outside, cold on the inside. Meat was hard, stale and cold. Veggies were fresh and plentiful
1621;We had originally ordered from the Brimley and Sheppard location. They always have wonderful service and great food. However our order got moved to this location due to a fire in the kitchen at the Sheppard location. THIS IS THE MOST ABSOLUTE WORST EXPERIENCE.We had pre ordered - Palabok, Lumpia, Kuchinta. It was picked up at this location at 4:00pm by the time the party had started at 6:30pm the palabok had been spoiled. Thus inedible. Oh and lets talk about how the kuchinta two days later had mold on it.Now we have ordered (as I stated from the Sheppard location) both and NOTHING HAS GONE WRONG WITH IT. When my mother called to inquire regarding this issue it was the most absolutely disgusting experience. The contact on the phone had asked my mother why she didn't bring it back on the day of. So this contact wanted us to LEAVE the party in which the food was purchased for to bring it all the way back? We live in Newmarket and not an option. Then the contact had proceeded to inform my mother that the 
1622;Expensive and no selection. Plus staff isn't very knowledgeable about products sold there. Natures emporium has way more selection
1623;Came to this store just to look around and once I walked in, there were 2 ladies who were talking and did not acknowledge I came in. Very rude customer service. Only 1 other customer was in the store compared to Ambrosia next door.
1624;Looks like the owner of this store OLEG I is mad at my review.....next time have better service and bad review won't be left dummy. And please when leaving a private message please learn to speak proper English!  Below is his message he personally went out of his way to send me and OLEG I happened to leave his own personal review of his own store! What the heck you doing, you pathetic excuse for a human being, going from spa to spa giving every business you walk into nasty 1* reviews, hiding under anonymous reviewer bs while trying to make yourself more pretty. Guess what, you aren't pretty, you are pathetic, both inside and out. You walk into into businesses where your type doesn't even belong and do same. No wander nobody pays any attention to you, you are hiding from the world and that's exactly why you don't have any followers and friends. Visit a psych doctor instead, but don't forget to leave him a bad review as well.Now would you want to shop here?!  sounds like a racist as well by referring to me 
1625;Loser Burger!After the customer ahead of me was finished ordering the girl working the cash looked at me told me it was her break and walked away on her cellphone. I had to yell back and forth with the guy working the grill in the back to make my order. Did I mention the food sucked? Never again!
1626;Horrible. Just horrible. First, the man at the cash register was extremely rude taking our order. Second, they called our number about 10 minutes after we ordered, my partner went up to grab it, and it's only 1 out of 2 burgers that were done. Why call the number if it's not done? Third, my burger had no cheese on it even though we paid an extra dollar for it. She says "sorry" and slaps a piece of cheese on it. Thanks for the cold cheese slice on my burger. Fourth (yes there is a fourth!) our fries were disgusting and soggy. Honestly, I never expect much from this chain, but this was beyond horrible. Horrible enough that they're getting a corporate email requesting my money back. I will never go back to this location and my recommendation for you is HARD PASS!
1627;I don't like giving 1 stars but this Hero Burger deserves 0.First off the cashier wasn't friendly at all. I told him I'd like a burger and he just looks at me silently. I then realized he wanted me to pick toppings. A simple "what would you like on the burger" would be nice.When we ordered we were number 90 and 87 had just been called. About 10 minutes later our ticket was announced. After approaching the window the cook told us only half the meal was ready... Why did you call me up if it wasn't ready? She began cooking the other burger and we got it in another 5 minutes.My partner paid $0.99 extra for cheese that they forgot. When he went up they just plopped a piece of cold cheddar cheese in. Pictures on the menu showed the cheese melted and delicious while ours looked cold and unappetizing.Finally to top things off, avoid the fries. They were really soggy. Biggest regret was not checking Yelp before going in thinking we could rely on the Hero brand. Never again.
1628;Had never tried Hero before but since this chain opened in my neighbourhood and I was starving and craving a burger I figured I'd give them a go. Wow I wish I could have my $11 back!  For the price I was expecting something way better! I could not even eat it, it was a horrible frozen patty with awful taste and texture. I give them 1 star for the fries which I rather enjoyed but I will definitely not be returning.  Wish they had of opened a five guys or burgers priest instead!
1629;Never again with this place.  I only went there because it was next to the dollar store, where i picked up some xmas wrappings.  I ordered a quick burger to take back to my desk during my lunch break.  When i got back, the grease from the burger patty literally soaked and dissipated the lower bun as well as the paper bag it was being held in. They put the blue cheese on the bottom side of the patty, not top, the fries were soggy, the burger patty was so greasy that it literally took a couple of paper towels to get it to a moderate grease level and the mushrooms were covered in greasy char.  the only saving grace?  the cola from the fountain machine.  All this for $14 bucks, no thank you.  I could've went to mcdonalds and got a way better experience and this saying a lot!will never eat here again, as i write this i'm starting to feel a bit queezy from the food.
1630;Ladies were smoking outside.  They had to enter the store after me.  Anyways I had a bday coupon which was only redeemable printed.  A bit disappointed especially in our generation of high technology and environmental issues.  You'd think showing it on my mobile screen would be good enough.  And the email didn't even have a code.
1631;Not familiar with the Hero chain so was a little overwhelmed at the number of different choices (i.e. having to list every individual salad item I wanted). The guy was so rude, like the stereotypical ditsy customer being undermined in the car mechanics.The burger was really below par. They forgot the cheese (seems to be a common occurrence looking at the other reviews!) and the meat was poor quality.Shame because it's right across the street from my new apartment, won't be returning.
1632;terribly bad value, burgers are pretty tiny relative to what yer paying and relative to other burgers similarly priced in the neighborhood. what really gets me though is the smell. no ventilation at all in this place. your clothes and hair will reek of greasy fry oil all day, making the afternoon at work unbearable and embarrassing.
1633;Good food. Absolutely horrible service. There's only ever one person working and he always takes his sweet-ass time. So frustrating.
1634;I had a hunkering for a burger, so when I joined my wife for lunch near her work we meandered over here for a quick meal that was somewhat of a mistake.Service was not rude, but not on top of things either. The food itself was rather bland the patty looked like they literally took it out of the freezer pre-shaped and then tossed it on to the grill for 5 minutes.I miss In-N-Out from California.
1635;I completely agree with Courtney - tried this place ("hey, a new burger joint near work!"). The burger itself was passable, nothing to write home about. I ordered onion rings - gack! The batter was WAY undercooked and the rings so greasy that they actually DRIPPED oil! Disgusting. Worse, getting back to work (after a 5 minute walk outdoors), everyone gagged - my jacket had picked up the grease odours - I guess the place is not ventilated! Took a day of airing out for my jacket to smell okay again!I think I'll stick to Merci Mon Ami for my occasional burger treat day!
1636;worst pizza and service ever, the workers look over worked and miserable. The pizza is also crap. They must be trying to cut cost so much that the pizza slices barely have any tomato sauce and you feel like you're eating a open faced cheese and pepperoni sandwich. Dipping sauce does not save this pizza. It's so dry.
1637;Amazing,If and only if, to you cardboard, slapped with "something" resembling tomato paste,and hosed down with filth is your idea of a delicious meal.If you value your money, intestinal fortitude, and self-respect...you'd find something better.Or just don't eat. How this chain exists is beyond me.I've had multiple workers at different locations tell me "you'd be stupid to eat this... " while recommending whatever was on special (sometimes it was marginally passable).If I'm going to feel like a fat - fuck, and engage in carbicide, it better be something that tastes better than whatever the hell this tastes like.Garbage. It's what's for dinner.
1638;Today I went to the Pizza Pizza located at Queen and McCaul, Toronto, Ontario. I was VERY VERY displeased with the service. I went with my younger brother, and i instructed him to order, the worker walked back and forth several times within earshot while several other workers were making pizza on the near by table. She was free to access us, but instead chose to ignore my brother. He said "excuse me," several times, when she did not respond i finally asked her for assistant, she reluctantly came over and asked us what we wanted. I requested a pepperoni slice, she said they were all out and the wait would be 10 minutes, i pointed to the sqaure pepperoni sqaure slices and asked why i couldn't just have one of those. She then put my pizza into the oven to warm up, my brother asked her if he could have a side of fries, she again choose to ignore him, i instructed him to ask her again louder, he did, and again she ignored him. I then asked her, she said that "well, i would have to make them." I had enough, so i sa
1639;Flies on the pizza that was sitting out there.  Ew.  Very disgusting.  I would NOT recommend it ... very unsanitary!
1640;Best not to eat here. The food is mediocre and 90% of the scantily clad servers don't exactly seem like the sharpest knives in the drawer and usually mess up your order, forget to bring you cutlery, or take forever to bring your order because they're too busy doing 'selfies' with drooling male patrons. This is not a pub - it's just a cheap bar were desperate men can drink beer and ogle the women servers. It's kinda sad, really. As a woman patron, one doesn't feel comfortable coming here because the majority of clientele are male. I can't understand why a restaurant would cater exclusively to only half the population. Not a great business model.Whatever you do, don't order a salad. After it's prepared, the cook will put it under the hot lights with other meals that need warming before pickup. This kind of stupid, unthinking practice makes for a rather disgusting, completely wilted salad.
1641;I came here at about 9:50 pm during the Canada day celebration fireworks.  I was here during a work trip and wanted some food and a beer.  When we arrived, there were many seats open as most people were outside waiting for fireworks.  All I can say is that the owner/manager has given up on this establishment.  It was terrible.  There were only three girls working, and they were clearly frustrated and overwhelmed.  Our waitress took our order for food and two beers and we received the drinks promptly.  At this point we sat and observed.  Aside from some families, there were about 20 "locals" that clearly knew the staff.  They were shady, many were drunk and we overheard two of them discussing going to he bathroom stall to use drugs.  We were seated outside and the worst part of this was that these characters were pacing around, clearly high on coke or something and took it upon themselves to come up to us and talk to us about really nothing.  There was also a man who was pacing out behind the hedge and meeting
1642;Worst restaurant I've been to in a long time. Our waitress was very slow and unorganized. First, one of my friends ordered a Guinness pint and after the waitress brought everyone's drinks, she still didn't bring the Guinness (the waitress was asked twice to bring it, and when it finally got to our table, the beer was flat and stale) Two of us ordered the Steak salad, a pizza and another person ordered the steak sandwich (which was supposed to be on a panini bun)- about 20 minutes after ordering, our waitress came over to advise there was no steak for the salad, but there was steak for the sandwich...hmm. So I ordered Fish Tacos...I then was advised there was also no fish. I disappointedly then ordered the Caesar salad. 10 minutes later, the waitress advised that there in fact was steak for the salads now. Interesting. Finally, our food came and it was disappointing. Salad was okay...but the cheese steak sandwich was on a Dempsters hamburger bun with cold garlic fries on the side (absolute crap!!!!!!!!) I hav
1643;Went there last night. We were greeted nicely. Everything was going fine till it was time for paying the bill. The bartenderess xxx told us that their card terminal is not working so she can only take cash. It was hard to believe that there was only one terminal but we paid cash. The bill was 150 and we paid her 200, and she assumed that the 50 was tip. She wasn't bringing the change back until we asked for it.A few minutes later we saw the card terminal being used by another waitress at tables behind us. So that meant the bartenderess was looking to make some cash tip from us and there was nothing wrong with the terminals.
1644;Conveniently located at the heart of Mississauga by Square One, The Titled Kilt has a prime location and free underground parking which is a plus! I had never visited this Pub & Eatery before, therefore I was curious and excited to experience what it had to offer. I went in with an open mind and a few of my friends, before even making it to our table I instantly regretted my decision to visiting that place.First and foremost, there was no one to greet us at the front which left us confused as to whether or not we should seat ourselves. Eventually a server came up to us and asked if we were waiting to be seated. She rapidly walked ahead of us and had us run after her like little ducks till we got to the table and were seated. She then disappeared for about 15 mins, then the same girl returned to inform us that she would be serving us. She didn't provide us with her name, specials, menus, nor even water! She then asked us if we would like anything to drink. My friends and actually had met working as wait sta
1645;Atrocious! This word describes the food, service, and ambiance. I saw cockroaches crawling on the floor. God knows if they get on the food or beer!  When there are so many fine places near by, why waste your money here.  Just thinking about this place makes my stomach churn! Just awful.
1646;Went here on a Friday night in group of 8. Surprisingly, place wasnt even busy. Servers were busy though "socializing" with other customers and the one supposedly responsible for taking our orders wasnt around for good 15mins. I even had to ask the bartender if she could call her for us. It took an hour for our food to arrive and when it did, food was just warm. I had a feeling food was just sitting in the counter for a while. We definitely did not enjoy the food and service here. Seeing other comments here make me think that I wasnt the only one. Anyhow, worst place I have ever been to. Please save your money and go somewhere else. If you wanna see nicer prettier girls, I suggest just go to Moxies or Bier Mrkt. Worst. Just worst.
1647;Worst pub. Service was slow, and I mean SUPER SLOOOOW. In general, its not a place that I would recommend to anyone, especially if you're going with more than one person.
1648;So I wud not recommend this place to anyone...just stay away...first time going here not by choice...my sister forced me...I walked into the door by the pools areas to a patron hands under one of the waitress skirt...yes the same one that the manager had to come and remove...she was stuck to that table like glue...sucks for business....waited for abt 10mins before one waddle her way over while 3 of them standing around  around the guys at the pools table area...oh get this...r they allowed to drink on the job? I get its a bar an thing but I  don't thing they shud be allowed to drink while working....yes saw 2 of them having shots with some guys....food was nothing to talk about....we had 2 kinds of wings won't recommend it...least to say we were not there for the food...we were there for the drinks...one of the drunken waitress spilled our double shots while walking over with it  and still brought it over half spilled...like really? Oh after  we order our drinks 15 mins later it didn't came...we had to ask an
1649;I'm writing this review specifically because we go here often as it is our local haunt and accept that the food is just okay to pretty good and the service ranges between adequate and poor because we have a large group of friends who frequent the place too. We had decided to go to Boston Pizza but because of an email my bf received regarding a free dessert that looked delicious in the photo decided to go here....anyway we ordered the dessert to go after we had finished our lunch and drinks (we asked for salted caramel - nothing with nuts because of allergies) and when we got home and opened the container the cookie was macadamia and white chocolate and it was RAW!!!! RAW!!! It was not just the fact that it had nuts (which my bf is allergic to) it's also that it was uncooked, a double whammy of hazardousness! This place has always been average but since new owners took over recently it has gone from bad to worse! Stay away!!!
1650;This place is a total dump. Our waitdresses/bartenders looked like they were 16 years old and were more intetested in talking with the regulars. Bar was unkept, they were out of 2 kinds of liquor, was never offered a menu, etc....The managers/owners need to be aware...this place does not live up to the tilted kilt name.
1651;This is likely the worst place in Sauga for food. every meal is bland. I get the whole concept of waitresses in kilts but they are literally 18 year old kids, that are treated badly. I feel bad ordering from them.
1652;Really wasn't that impressed with this place at all. Food was bland, and service was less than mediocre. The waitresses barely paid any attention to us and questioned what we wanted to have. She's roll her eyes every time we picked something she obviously disapproved of.  Also when it came to paying. The waitress drooped the bill on our table and never came back for it. The tip machine also has a default of 20 dollars. Or other. Just because the waitresses are dressed in bras and skirts so short I can practically see their kooch doesn't mean they deserve a 20 dollar tip.  Not to mention the patrons there were loud obnoxious and rowdy. The other employees didn't even bother calming them down. One actually brought in a whistle and would blow it as hard as the could randomly throughout our meal Awful experience and by far the worst bar pub I've ever had the displeasure of going to
1653;Let me preface this with the statement that I eat out in a restaurant for most of my meals.  I grew up in the restaurant business and understand good service, good management and customer expectations.  I also rarely tip less than 20% on a bill.  Last night was a rare exception the only time this year less than 0.5% of all of my dining experiences in 2014.  The Tilted Kilt is a chain breastaurant with good food, a good beer selection, and typically, very attentive waitresses.  Last night was not typical of the ones I have dined at in the past.  My coworkers and I went there to watch football, eat and have a few drinks. For some reason, our waitress was determined to flip our table as quickly as possible after the first 90 minutes.  We were enjoying apps, dinners and drinks beginning around 7pm.  Our tab would have been higher, but after our food was served, she began clearing our table.  After the final plate was taken, she even took our DD's half-full glass of water.  I guess they needed the glasses or s
1654;Worst service ever..no kidding... The bar had maybe 12 patrons in it. We came in with 5 of us. We waited over 30 minutes and had to go to them to pay attention to us. When we finally got to order drinks they said last call was in 10 minutes. We were an airline crew who literally ran to this place after checking in to our nearby hotel. We watched the wait crew ignore us. After a long day we just wanted a few beers. After we finally got to order it took another 20 minutes to get our drinks.... Not slamming Tilted Kilt and the other ones I've been too were great. This place in Mississauga Ontario Canada was the worst. Shame on them.... Yeah, we still tipped the waitress but it was total bullshit.
1655;If you like hanging out w skids and wanna have dirty hands cuz you cant get any napkins then this is the place for you. A Complete shit show. Hey who wants to watch the NHL playoffs when they got Red Bull sailing on and the fucking shopping channel. GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER you fucking clowns.
1656;This place is the worst. The amout of losers and old people that come here just makes you avoid this place at all costs. I can care less about the hoes that work here either
1657;Food is crap. Service is slow. They do have lots of beers on tap. The place was dead when I was here .
1658;Chronically forgets my order. They serious need to fix their tracking system so they don't keep forgetting peoples order. Ended up waiting 45 minutes for an order.
1659;I don't write reviews of places but I actually got a yelp account to write this review. Worst pick-up experience of my life. First, I call, the guy picking up mumbles, asks me to repeat my phone number then interrupts me, tries to hang up on my before I'm done my order, and makes weird mistakes (I ask for a small coke, he asks if I want 1.5L). They then tell me half an hour which seems long for a one pizza order but I go there and am amazed to see the most employees I have ever seen working at a pizza place at one time (10-15). No one greets me or tries to help me when I walk in. They ask me if I had an order that's not mine. They finally find and punch in my order but charge the wrong special (1 topping special add 3 toppings, instead of 4 topping special) so I have to ask them to change it. Then their debit card machine is broken and the guy offers me a portable one with a $1.50 fee. I leave without checking the order and come home to find the wings are plain and have no BBQ sauce on them and the pizza is i
1660;Had a walk in order that took 3 tries to get right - once 'forgetting' our order then the second time with the wrong ingredients (a veggie pizza was covered in pepperoni).  A refund was not granted despite multiple requests. Enjoy our $12, will never be back.
1661;At least once a year I get a craving for Taco Bell... I know, gross right? And so bad for you too! I ordered the crunch wrap supreme once and it was so soggy and didn't taste like anything. Very bland. The last time I remember going there I got hard tacos and again absolutely no flavour.  Had to use hot sauce packets and even then it just tasted like their hot sauce. Serves me right for going there I guess lol
1662;For whatever reason i was craving taco bell which I havent had for months. I got the new crunch rap, the one with sour cream and guac, and I was tasteless and soggy, so much  for crunch. Taste was bland and made me nauseous. Dont think I will go to taco bell ever again.Cons: tasteless soggy foodPros : Somewhat cheap
1663;Not authentic, expensive! Crap, poor quality, burrito boyz def hands down authentic mexican food. Save ur $ highly not recommened.
1664;This place is awful! The service is mediocre, the entertainment is cheesy, and the food is horrible. We ordered three plates of kabob and it took about an hour for our food to come. The rice tasted bad and the meat was cold. Both the appetizers and the main dishes were not prepared properly and had no taste. To make things worse we were billed $100.72 for three people! The restaurant owners have the nerve to charge an 18% gratuity for atrocious food and service.Shiraz also has some novelties. If you ever go there check the vegetarian menu, they have a number of fish kabob dishes. Apparently the management doesn't know the definition of the word vegetarian. Overall Shiraz has bad service, poorly prepared food, a highly overpriced menu, and bland entertainment. I would never recommend this place to anyone. I've had better experiences with street food.
1665;I really don't recommend this place. The food is not good, service is bad. The entertainment is so cheesy. Not gooooodd
1666;I had seen tons of signs around the local area promoting the "all you can eat wings."I thought it was a great concept, I just never took the time to go check it out.One night the guys from work and I decided we would go for a beer & wings.$13 for the all you can eat wings, and we split a pitcher.You pick your sauce and you start with 6 wings...........then slowly......... yep........slowly they bring you refills of 4. They make you wait. No doubt part of the strategy,I assume they hope you get full waiting. Perhaps they think it will reduce waste.During our visit we got full while waiting and two us wasted 3 of the 4 wings each.I think this is such a stupid practice. (A) I'd never suggest anyone check it out! So no good word of mouth coming from me (or anyone in my group). (B) I'd certainly not rush to go back here, not now, possibly not ever.During our visit I asked the lady if we could double our order, I let her know I'd eat over 10 wings easily. I was told, "no, other people are waiting."
1667;Went here on a friday night and was very disappointing as soon as we pulled up. We had a great coupon so I decided to give it a try regardless of what my spidey-sense was telling me. Wow this place looked like a seinor citizens club from the 70's. Its very clear that this place hasn't been changed since before the jays won the world series. walls are cluttered with old sports memorabilia purchased when Bi-Way was still around.  We decided on have wings, just the wings. Hot, Hot & honey garlic. They were large, but not that tasty, Meh. Nothing special at all they didn't even bother to do the basics well,  Half of my wings were half coated in my desired sauce. Its safe to say we wont be returning to this place. Now i know why there were 8 people in the bar, including staff and customers.
1668;The food was very bland. Even worse, the rice that they put into my burrito was hard and crunchy (disgusting). I've been to a lot of sandwich restaurants and this was the only place to charge extra for tomatoes....I paid to acknowledge the fact that I will never buy food from a Fit for Life restaurant ever again.
1669;The worst chicken shawrma I've ever had...wish I could give no stars but don't have the option. The chicken was raw and the tahini and garlic sauce seems to have expired. I hate to give business owners a bad a review but come on!
1670;I wrote to the head office about our bad experience and they didn't even bother to reply. This is what I wrote them:Order @ ClarksonHello, My family regularly frequents the Osmow's locations in Brampton, Streetsville and Milton. For the first time, we ordered from the Clarkson location and were sorely disappointed. We ordered three large chicken on the rocks, one large beef on the rocks and one medium chicken on stix and a fattoush salad for the 7 of us, thinking it should be enough based on the portion sizes we are used to. A few points:1) the large containers were nowhere near full, and much less than we are used to from other locations. 2) we paid for garlic on the fattoush, none was provided. 3) we did not receive the chicken on stix, even though we had paid for it. When we realized on our way home, we turned around and had to go back to get it. 4) once we were home, we realized all the issues and called the Clarkson location. We spoke to Monty, who was disinterested and whose best solut
1671;Worst osmows I've been to. Very dry. And hot sauce tastes very weird. The wrap was very loose. Terrible. I couldn't finish it.
1672;What a disappointment. Ordered a large special, the chicken came out of the fridge, and they heated it on the grill. The chicken portion was small and the wrap was mostly veggies and bread. Also ordered a beef...it was the worst I have ever tasted. Save your money and go to the location east of port credit or streetsville. I am rating it a 1. But I am not the only one disappointed. The average is a 3.
1673;I'll start off my saying the place was clean. Sadly that is where I don't have much else to compliment them on.  I ordered the beef shawarma plate. It looks good...the taste however was blank. I can only describe it as that...BLANK. It had zero flavour. Whatever the white sauce was it was not garlic I mean not even close. The beef was super bland.  only the fries had taste. I know I should have gotten the rice however I was looking for something different. My mistake I guess. This came with a salad. I choose Greek and sorry to say it was just bad. The Greek dressing was over oily, they used 4th rate feta...this means it's most likely the fake shit.  Was I supposed to add salt? Is that what I missed doing? Overall I wished I had spent my $17 on someplace else. Come on guys you are not even trying. This is 3rd rate food. Try harder, maybe use some real Mediterranean flavours in everything you cook there. That's what is expected no? I do not recommend...
1674;The "drive thru" is more of a yell thru as no one seems to have working headsets or whispers to you. Poor customer service. The staff also only make one item at a time, so by the time you get all your items, half of it is already cold.
1675;Regrettably this Tim Horton's gave me food poisoning after visiting this location on Bayview and High Tech about a month ago. Some friends and I play basketball every Thursday in the gymnasium, this is usually our meet up place and we went here after playing. I ordered a chicken wrap, sesame bagel with butter and a carton of 2% plain milk. The bagel and milk tasted fine, but the chicken wrap was cold, didn't taste fresh. Upset stomach and food poisoning, I'll spare you the details of what happened next. Took about a week for me to feel better. I'm very cautious about where and what I eat outside. Won't be visiting this Tim Horton's to eat again.
1676;Don't waste your time or money!They will tell you that their pizza won an award and that they have been in business for 48 years. Don't believe them. I thought this place might be a cool find since it's run by Italians and has been around for such a long time. I didn't expect gourmet but I was hoping for authenticity and freshness, but got crappo instead of primo. The dough is flavorless and the toppings are dull. The cheese is also low quality.
1677;I came on here to prevent people from wasting their money and getting upset like I did! How is this place in business??Came here on my lunch break, the cashier was terrible and looked like she either just took a nap in the back or her cat ran away... ordered the 3 tacos for $9... not a bad price right? While the server is making the tacos she mumbles something that resembles the word guacamole and I say yes and notice the 50 cent guac sign. again, not bad. They put NOTHING on your taco... no corn, no tomatoes... just the meat of your choice, cheese, and salsa. EVERYTHING is extra. Get to the cash... $13. I was charged 3 times... 3 tacos x 50c = $1.50. for 3 tiny tacos. on top of this I walked all of 5 minutes back to my office and they were SOAKED. the hard taco wasnt even hard anymore, no crunch because everything had turned to mush. they soaked through tin foil, a layer of napkins, a brown paper bag and onto my pants....everything about this place is brutal. $15 can get you a plate of tacos at a rea
1678;Besides being overpriced and not that great, the service here was abysmal. So the guy took my order and I wanted a burrito but no rice or beans. He looked at me like I was nuts. Yeah, I get that it will be smaller than normal, but I don't like rice or beans and prefer extra lettuce or something crunchy.The reason that I even went to this place was because I was in a rush and really hungry. Finally, they guy assembled my burrito and handed put it on a tray. He rang it up for $9.95. I handed him a 10 and he turned his back on me and started chatting and laughing with a co worker. I stood there, hangry and in complete disbelief that I was being ignored with money in my hand. He kept on yakking even when I politely said "excuse me..".Finally, my patience had worn thin and I was ready to skin the dude alive:"Can I pay for my damn burrito and be on my way?""Oh, sorry", he replied, as though I was interrupting his social break time or something.After all that the burrito was mediocre.I don't want to have
1679;Horrendous food like absolutely awful. Not to mention they charged an extra 50 cents per tilapia taco even though the menu board only mentions this surcharge for guacamole and shrimp. Seriously, don't waste your money.
1680;Wow...what a rip off.I frequent other Mucho Burritos in Vaughan, and usually order the same items. There, my order comes to around $23. Last night I stopped here on the way to see Ross Petty's Pantomime at the Elgin Theatre (after misreading the start time on the ticket...didn't have time to go anywhere but a food court) and the same order came to almost $30....almost $7 more. I get that it's n a food court and in the Eaton Centre (and rent may be higher)  but come on! When I placed my order, I asked for rice in my quesadilla (as I do in Vaughan) and was told "no"...that the panini press they use to heat the quesadilla would harden the rice. He said if I wanted rice, I'd have to get a burrito. I asked what they heat the burrito on and he pointed to the same panini press....so I said if they heat the burrito on it and it's ok, why wouldn't it be ok in a quesadilla. He just shrugged and said "no" again. I then said I'd risk the rice being hard and he said "no" again. So much for getting what you want. The
1681;We had the Taco trio. The meats (chicken, pork and beef) were all cold (i.e. below room temp).  The server said this was normal. I hope the food inspectors re-evaluate this place. The salsa was 'off' and had that 'fizzy' taste. The portions per taco were miniscule. Beans and rice were extra. Really?!?!  Honestly, $26 for two taco trios and one order of chips felt like a complete rip off. We've eaten at other Mucho Burrito locations and they were at least passable. This location in the Eaton Centre Eatery is the worst fast food I've ever eaten. Prepackaged Macdonalds is better than this. What's that tell you?
1682;I had a very unfavourable experience at their Eaton Centre Location. I requested soft corn tacos due to a gluten allergy - the gentleman changed his gloves and obliged. He then layered my soft taco shells on a piece of foil - but he placed them overlapping each other. After he grilled them, the tacos were impossible to remove from the foil and each other - when I pointed out that the issue, he simply ignored me and continued to prepare them. He ended up ripping the tacos while peeling them off of each other to the point that I couldn't even hold them together when I ate them, as all the toppings were falling out. They then were incredibly stingy with the toppings, delicately putting only a tablespoon of meat in each taco - which in itself was insulting considering the massive burritos they were making for everyone else.When I finally received my items and proceeded to the cash register, the woman behind the counter was incredibly rude. I had pulled out my SPC card, as they do offer free chips and salsa for 
1683;Probably the worst burrito I have ever had, plus the service was really slow and not very friendly.
1684;This place is pretty bad. The only good thing about it is the portion sizes.. that's it. The small sized burrito is pretty big even.  Okay now onto the bad. First off, they put way too much sauce into the burritos and their tortilla is way too thin or something because the moment I opened my burrito wrapping, there was already a gigantic hole in the burrito tortilla and everything was leaking out. I ended up eating the burrito with a spoon. That's how bad it was. Also, it doesn't even taste that good! Avoid the Jarrito drinks as well. More pricey than regular fountain drinks and tastes like a bad version of Crush too.
1685;Servers get orders wrong,  had to ask numerous times what everyone's order was. (Every one who was standing in line.)  Oh,  and the "butter chicken combo" is rice with four small pieces of chicken.
1686;I paid $7.45 plus tax ($8.50) for the daily Tuesday special. I got the butter chicken. Half the take out box was plain rice. With 6 pieces of chicken (bite sized). RIDICULOUS. You expect me to pay $8.50 for a few bites of chicken with sauce? I can get Indian food elsewhere for less with DOUBLE THE PORTION. This place used to give lots. They are just cheating out now. Very bad. And the guy tried to argue with me that I get what I paid for. So you are telling me I'm paying $1 per bite of chicken for food court quality? Bullshit...
1687;If I could give them a zero I would but the prices for their curry bowl is ridiculous. If I wanted authentic Indian food I can just go to Babu just up the street on16th. I do not like how the pressure you to buy their food when clearly it's over price. You're better off just going to another place in this location.
1688;I concur with the other reviewers and would give this place a 0 if I could.  Food was small in portions and not filling at all for the price you pay.  I didn't ask for their naan bread but they said that they will give it to me.  Being that it was 10 min before closing I thought it was free.  They then charged me for it hoping I wouldn't notice.   Not the type of business I want to support.
1689;I came here for their butter chicken.  I had been to the one at Yorkdale and the butter chicken there was good.  The butter chicken here was watery, and the portion is much much smaller than Yorkdale.  If I could give zero star, I would.
1690;I'll make this review brief.Restaurant environment was dirty, from the ceiling to the floor however, the bowls and chopsticks seemed clean.The food quality was visually unappetizing.. they gave me the feeling of how they don't care much about their food, just as long as the food is editable and gets on the plate is all that matters.Owner of the restaurant came out and tried to act all friendly, but unfortunately every time he talks above my head, his spit would land on top of my head and on the food I was eating.  I gave the 1 star for the free shower I got from him.Owner gave us free dishes on the house, but right off the bat I could tell that the meat they gave us were about to go bad and they had to get rid of it ASAP. The crab dish didn't taste fresh at all even though the owner came over and told us that he had a secret aquarium at the back where they only cook live fresh crabs!.. Didn't go to the washroom because I read the other reviews about how dirty and cramped it was.Overall, I won't
1691;Absolutely horrible place, can skip  !   If the rating system would let me, the place would get zero star. First off, expect you clothes (from top layer to under garments) to smell like the place when you are done, air circulation was almost non exist.  I was sweating all along and could not feel a single drop of AC, on top of that, be constantly prepared to fan off those pesky small flies that try to share your food.The food was ok, we ordered 5 plates and they were all overly salty.  We had to warn a friend to watch her consumption, since she had issues with high blood pressure.  One thing I noticed about the cooking was that red hot pepper and green pepper were aplenty on every single dish. Even the sour vege and fish soup was chockablock with them.  In addition, you better be a fast eater.  While we were trying to enjoy our food and half way through eating (but long before we were going to ask for the check), different waitress came around 4 times in less than 5 minutes to ask if they could take our
1692;This review is not for those with a weak stomach. Please do not read any further if you are the aforementioned.Ok, after a night of HOT POT we were walking back the car when my Gf's dad noticed this place.He had eaten at a lot of places in northern China and the memories of this genre of food always brought him back to good times and good food.We decided to try this place the following week and he was so excited to find a place that could possibly match the ones in his memory.We ordered quite a bit of dishes, (He was like a kid in a candy store.)Here's our order:1.) Porkbones - the dish that came out was pretty much boiled pork bones with soy sauce poured over them. boring and not appetizing at all. MEH~2.) Spicy cucumber - seems like they make this a couple of nights before and stuck it in the fridge. The ingredients were not fresh at all and it looked like SHLOP. (pig food)3.) Spicy Eggplant - this dish was good. (or was it because the 2 previous dishes were so bad? IDK)4.) Fishhead with t
1693;Worst chinese "food" ever. I wish I could give it a negative rating!!  In the past, I've had chinese food that's maybe was too spicy, greasy, salty, etc for my liking..... but never chinese food that completely lack any flavour. It's really quite strange how everything is coated in a sauce... yet has no flavour?!!! Honestly confused how you could make such tasteless sauces...corn starch and food colouring??Save your money, and eat somewhere else. This Chinese food will probably be the worst you will have have ... that was certainly the case for me.
1694;After ordering in last night due to the snow storm in Toronto Ho lee chow had the nerve to bring the worst peices of scrap to my house I've ever seen ( I won't disrespect the word "food") the peices of scrap was so bad I had to bring it back to them and to my suprise I found the filthiest restaurant in Toronto
1695;Yes, I enjoy American style Chinese food and I was always satisfied with the food I ordered from Ho Lee Chow.  However it appears that this location has new ownership and since that happened the food has gone down hill.  My last pick-up order was tasteless and the vegetables were undercooked.   All I can say is I have not been back.
1696;Ok so their response (after arguing in circles) is that they always give out 6oz of chicken and 5oz of beef. They never give less. Also their policy is to only give a credit for future orders. They NEVER give a refund. I asked to speak to anyone above the customer service manager and she said that the CEO would look into the situation. I asked when I would be hearing back from him, and she said that he was (surprise surprise) on vacation. She couldn't give me a phone number or email address for him. After I told her I was going to the newspapers and tv news about their horrific service and sub par food, she told me that our conversation was being recorded. Isn't that illegal?  Don't they have to let customers know that their calls are being recorded at the beginning of the call??Again, DO NOT EVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, ORDER FROM HO-LEE-CHOW
1697;Ho Lee Chow! How did I not read these reviews first.  Bad.  Just... Bad.  Don't try it.  It took an hour and a half to get here - they promised 45 min.
1698;Vile taste-free food.  They advertise they don't use MSG, but in their case they need it.  I've gone here twice.  Both times the food had no flavour at all, or it was disgusting.  Seriously they can even ruin chow-mein which is a pretty simple dish to make.  Just Google Ho Lee Chow, and you'll find it referred to as Ho Lee *four-letter-word*.Its not all that cheap there either.  You're paying good money for insanely bad food. Don't go here unless you're actually starving to death, and want something edible that probably isn't poisonous.
1699;Was told it would be an hour for delivery. An hour and forty minutes later, still no food. Call them twice. Told both times it would be right there. They offered me a $4 credit on a $30 order. What a joke. Cancelled the order. Never again.
1700;I should have checked Yelp before ordering for delivery. They made a mistake on one dish. Pork instead beef. I called right away and was told I was mistaken. They could not see the dish. The meat was white. It was not beef.While they argued with me, my son refused to eat a chicken ball. I tried one and had to chew my way through the batter. It was really chewy. Other dishes were lower quality. I asked for a refund. They told me they would send someone over to pick up the food. Nobody arrived. We stopped eating the food, worried about the quality. I experienced stomach pain that night but thank goodness we did not eat more. Sent an email to head office. No response. $40 in food ended up in the compost. Order at your own risk.
1701;One of the worst Chinese food experiences I have ever had. I had ordered it for delivery and was sadly disappointed. The chicken dish had little chicken but a ton of raw onions. The beef dish had a few small pieces of beef, a few large pieces of green pepper and a ton of raw onion, finally the vegetable dish had a few large pieces of peppers and carrots but again, tons of raw onions. My god what is with the loads of raw onions.
1702;Absolutely the worst food -- not just Chinese food, but food in general -- I have ever had delivered in my entire life! Not to mention, incredibly expensive for small portion sizes! That said, I'm glad the portions were small because it was less for me to throw out in the garbage. The overall flavor is just, sour and tangy. Almost as if it's completely spoiled. Hot garlic wings: 4/10Vegetables with tofu: 3/10Cantonese chow mein: 0/10Garlic beef: 1/10Vegetable fried rice: 6/10Overall: 2/10 = 1 star rating
1703;Seriously gross food!  I wouldn't recommend this place to you even if you stole my purse and racked up my credit card.  It's that bad.
1704;Worst food ever!!  slimy, flavourless and pricy.  I like chinese food and north american-ised chinese food.  I had a craving for the later and that is why I tried Ho Lee Chow and man, it was bad.  Never again.Chinese food from mall food courts tasted better.  I tried it as I see the company everywhere but I don't know how they stay in business with horrible tasting food.  Absolutely don't eat here if you have tastebuds.
1705;It's hard to get Chinese food wrong, but these guys managed it!The food lacked the basic ingredient of salt. I paid 10 bucks for szechuan chicken which had maybe 3-4 tiny bits of chicken which I literally had to dig out from under mountains of onions. And the dish tasted like absolutely nothing. I mean last I checked, szechuan style food is particularly known for its spicyness. The fried rice was doused in sesame oil and the soup was completely rancid. They only thing bearable were the Asian spring rolls, but if there was shrimp in there, I couldn't find it.Also contrary to the tag line on there menu and website, the food was neither fresh, nor fast. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE.
1706;Wow! Worst food ever. The mall has better food.Just don't .  Not to mention the 1.5 hrs it took to arrive.
1707;Zero Stars. Have been waiting over two hours for our food, called to see what was happening and the driver hasn't even picked it up yet. Food is okay but not worth the wait. Not ordering from here again.
1708;We ordered $93.00 of food last night. Web site said 45 minute delivery, After 1.5 hours I called and they said it would be here in 5 minutes. 30 minutes later the driver showed up. One of the bags had leaked. Took the food and guess what? It was cold.We ordered honey garlic ribs. The container was only half full and the sauce had become jelly. And cold.The chicken balls were only partially cooked and very doughy inside.The rice, which I generally love was really bad. It was all sticky and tasteless.Years ago this was one of my favourite Chinese Take out, but I think they had problems and went out of business. They are back but the quality of food is not what it used to be. They are not cheap and Mandarin is a better deal for quality. Or better still go to your local neighbourhood Chinese Restaurant and use them.I highly recommend anyone else but Ho Lee Chow!!!
1709;I would give 0 stars if I could. Placed our order online around 7:15pm. Received a call shortly after to take my credit card and was advised that delivery should take approximately 45 minutes. Food still hadn't arrived by 8:55pm so I called, was told that the restaurant got really busy but that they spoke to the driver and he's close and we should be receiving our order in about 5 minutes. Fine. At 9:13pm I receive a call asking to confirm if I still would like to receive my order!?!? I ask what happened to being 5 minutes away and was told that the driver was confused and that he didn't have my order. If I still wanted it, it would be about another hour but they would offer me 20% off. No way in hell was I waiting 3 hours (at least), so I cancelled my order and advised I will never ever be ordering from them again. We ordered pizza instead from the always excellent Pizzaville which came quickly and was delicious.Stay as far away as humanly possible from this place.
1710;Worst pizza pizza ever. I asked for a small salad. They charged me for a large one and charged me extra for chicken. I only got most of my money back after I pointed it out. I asked for crispy chicken they gave me grilled chicken. I requested Asian sesame dressing and hey had run out. I said I would eat it here and they packed it to go. It's like he can't hear what I'm saying or something. Anyways the salad was disgustingly overpriced. I usually don't write negative review but this was beyond unacceptable.
1711;Rude and abusive people, would not recommend you visit this location. My husband visited this location to pickup a pizza ordered earlier. The order was not ready as per the 20 minute guarantee and when reminded about the "20 minute or its free" policy, was abused and believe it or not called "..... a beggar asking for charity". Pizza Pizza was notified and action has been taken against this franchisee. Never got to taste the pizza but the customer service and abuse was in bad taste...
1712;Placed an order online tonight. Provided with a 40 minute timer, the driver was clearly late. Called in and pizza pizza said it will be free. When the driver arrived we told him it was over 40 minutes and he was extremely rude! He wouldn't give us the pizza and said "you have to fucking sign" "no free pizza". Horrible customer service! Unheard of someone swearing at their customers. Sorry, but that's your policy.
1713;I was at this location this morning for coffee. The employee at cash had already scolded the customer in front of me for asking for a sleeve. When I placed my order, she made an error which I corrected. When she came back with my order, it was incorrect and I brought this to her attention. Instead of apologizing for her error, she started to yell at me and not own her mistakes. I would have let it go but when you start to yell at the customers for YOUR mistake, that is completely unacceptable. Not only did she not apologize but she slammed the corrected coffees onto the counter and speak to her co-worker in their native tongue while looking my way. I am absolutely disgusted by the level of customer service from this employee. Don't work in a job where you have to deal with the general public if you can't deal. I was quite patient and polite with her until she started yelling at me like a lunatic.
1714;The location is on the Subway line and the washroom is 3rd world at best, filthy and smelling of urine. Unfortunately, my wife was also locked in this stinky washroom yesterday for 30 minutes. The unapologetic manager simply got a hammer and screwdriver to open the door. I'm not sure why my wife had to be stuck in there for 30 minutes or why the staff could not be of assistance. I can assure you that had I been present I would have kicked the door down or at least have called 911. What if my wife (or anyone?) was prone to panic attacks or claustrophobia? What if she had an underlying medical condition?The staff were untrained on what to do in a situation like this. Not the staff's fault, 100% management.Btw - the coffee was the usual mediocre swill usually served by Tim's, personally I can't drink the stuff. My wife usually doesn't either but she wanted coffee and had to use the toilet.Avoid this place.
1715;I agree employees at this tim horton location are a, bit rude. Today at 10 pm ( Jan 16, 2016), I went into tim horton to order hot chocolate, there was a, white female who was, extremely rude and, racist, she gave me this attitude and handled my drink is such a, rough manner that she sort of roughly placed it on counter. Then I saw her interaction with the two, white guys who lined up after me, she was all polite and friendly. No thinking on her part..that shes in Korea town, and A majority of the customers are minorities, maybe, she should work in tim hortons in a, small town where there's racist people like her who live there. I'm a regular customer and when I compare this location to the one near uoft, it's not compareable, the the cauasian girls who work at the uoft location are very, respectful and well trained in mannerism and, customer services.
1716;This mcdonalds did not properly prepare my friend's meal. They forgot to get their sauce. It took them 20 minutes to make a simple meal when it usually only takes 5 mins, with the minimum amount workers required. The poutine is adequately cold and not enough gravy. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND coming here at a late time cause the service drastically is lowered and not enough people working here.
1717;We came in at 10:45 and bought breakfastIt's !Waited and waited.. 11:20 they say the didn't make the order and now we can't have the food we paid for...then the girl says she can see what kind of breakfast there is available...my kids didn't get to eat cause they can't do their job right..How do you forget to serve people? You have 1 fucken job! Beware of the morons working here!
1718;Went here today arrived at 7:00pm I had my order in by 7:10 didn't get my food until an hour later I'm typing as I wait to 7:58pm. It does not take an hour to make a burger. It was not even busy. The server was nice but the place STANK, disgusting. Never coming again.. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE
1719;Ridiculous service. I was there for almost 2 hours, and barely got half of what my family ordered, until we decided to just take our food to go. People were being served ahead of us, when we arrived long before them, and half the people there didn't have any food. Just water. Won't be coming back any time soon.
1720;Wow. I've been to other wild wing locations and the food has been good. This place was horrible. The chicken wings (boneless) tasted like they had been cooked hours in advance and then reheated. We didn't finish our meal and did not take it home with us. I feel sick. If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Absolutely disgusting. Will not return and would not recommend.
1721;Sat there for 10 minutes waiting for a menu and the waitresses were taking a selfie never going  back
1722;Dropped in on a Saturday night....thankfully prior to the rush beginning. We found a seat immediately and our server was over shortly thereafter, told us the wing/beer special, took our drink order and off she went.When she returned, we ordered our dinner and some appetizers. Appetizers were Mac and cheese triangles...absolutely the greasiest, worst tasting item I've ever put in my mouth at a restaurant. Potato skins were very dry...no flavour at all.Some of us ordered the wing dinner, which was wings, fries and a soft drink (no refills). The fries came out as an appetizer...not with the wings. They were basic fries and pretty flavourless.When our food came out, it came out at different times. 2 people got their order (one was a wing dinner and the other a burger dinner) while a 3rd was returned because the person who brought out the wings could not tell us which type of wings they were. She said she would be right back with them, but she answered a phone and talked on it for an awfully long time. 10 minu
1723;Service was good. Food was terrible. The wings were small like the wings you would get in the  frozen section at Pathmark or BJs. It was smothered in sauce. Sounds good right? NOTTTT! My friends didnt like the wings at all but still got the 30 wings thinkings it would be good because of the 100+ flavors they offer. The Calamari appetizer was nowhere near the taste or price of $9.95. It was skimpy and looked like it came from a frozen package. It tastes fishy too so wasnt pleasant for my friends to eat. I got a buffalo fried chicken sandwich which was mediocre. The bun was crispy and was actually expecting a salad after reading the description....Giving it one star because food was edible and not tasty and service was not attentive. Our original waiter left halfway through our dinner without telling us she was leaving which I felt was rude. Wouldnt go again.
1724;I was there with my family and the service is so slow!  They have drawing placemats for the kids but no crayons.  I think  our food took about 30 minutes to come to us and it wasn't good at all!  I am not taking my family here again!
1725;I used to like the wings but they are pricey considering that every time I go there they seemed to get smaller and smaller, the only thing they got going for them is the dipping sauce. I don't go anymore. I found a better spot.
1726;This was our first and last time here.We had to constantly flag down our waitress to get ANYTHING -- it was like we were an afterthought. The portions were small, over priced, and under seasoned. I was absolutely flabbergasted that my "1/2 rack of baby back ribs" consisted of five dried out barely 3" long bones.  When I questioned the waitress about the portion, she sent the Manager to our table. He insisted that I was given  "a half rack". Really? Maybe HALF of a half rack, but NOT a real half rack.Accompanied by frozen fries and a mini-cup of mayonnaise-y slaw -- not a good deal for $18.My eating partner was similarly unimpressed with his wings & salad.Skip this place.
1727;I came in last week and ordered some boneless wings. I was not impressed. The wings tasted dry and old. It was okay, I never got sick. I recommend this restaurant to buy their meat from Wings Up in the West end of the GTA. They have the best and freshest wings.Wings were served in a wicker basket, not on a plate. I felt like I was eating at a food truck. Food should be served on a plate please!Staff were very friendly. Bathroom had pee on the floor.
1728;Honestly, this place sucks. I mean, if you're gonna go here at all definitely eat in, but honestly just don't go. I'm quite a fan of ordering take out, so I've tried this place twice now. Each time I go in to pick up my food, I'm waiting at the bar beside people eating and drinking, while the workers ask me to wait because they're throwing my food together real quick. So I got honey garlic wings (definitely lacked the honey garlic part), with a side of poutine... let me tell ya that ain't no Canadian poutine, that's 10 French fries tops, a few cheese curds and a SIDE of gravy... I MEAN THEY DIDN'T EVEN PUT IT ON MY RIES AND CHEESE.... and I say ries because they were barely even fries so like moral of the story is stay far away, it's not worth it.
1729;Ordered the Thai Lettuce wrap. flavour was nice, but served slightly warm in a cast iron skillet. So temperature was disappointing.And yes..... I was sick for 3 days after this.... One of many cases of salmonella http://www.newstalk1010.com/news/2016/06/20/exclusive-scores-of-salmonella-cases-linked-to-bradford-eatery
1730;Their hot sauce tastes like ketchup.if you hate ketchup like me, I suggest you stay away
1731;DISGUSTING OVERPRICED SLOP!Can't begin to describe how gross this place is. To top off the horrendous food, a staff member was vomiting violently while we were eating- no doubt due to having eaten at this HELL HOLESHOULD'VE ASKED FOR MY MONEY BACKI'm sure you would have a better meal out of a dumpster
1732;Worst Customer service EVER. I was standing waiting to order and the guy had no customers and he didn't ask me How Can I help you, or what can I get you. So I said I'll have beef shawarma, but he didn't proceed to make my shawarma. I asked him if he was going to make it and he said, "why don't you just f off"!!! Needless to say I walked out for good. I spoke to other people who said he made them wait an exceptionally long time. Bad Customer service deserves NO Business.
1733;STAY AWAy!  Terrible experience.  Grossly overpriced,  poor quality of food and THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!We ordered a large Shawarma plate that cost $22.95!  Since the chef does not run his rotisseries we had to wait about 25 min for the food to be ready only to find it was mostly rice and a very basic salad (lettuce and tomatoes) topped off with the Shawarma and sauce.   When compared to the Chef's Door also in Oakville where you get a plate for $11 that has rice, potatoes, nicely appointed salad and meat you cannot even start to compare.   Worst of all you will feel very uncomfortable in the place, the owner and employees are not friendly AT ALL and you get the distinct feeling they are saying rude things about you in their own language.  I dont know how he stays in business. I gave this place a second change but found the experience to be the worst on both occasions.
1734;This was literally the worst shawarma I've ever had. It was a joke. Asked for a chicken shawarma and the attached photo is what I actually got. A pile of half burnt half raw chicken and some lettuce. Where I come from that is not even close to a shawarma. Where's the tomatoes? The onions? The turnips? The pickles? Etc. For $8 - do not waste your time or money.
1735;Went in with colleagues for lunch, we were all so suprised upon encountering these very very rude people ... didn't understand a word we said so their son  came in to help....plus they were out of beef shawarma which was the whole point of going there in the first place at what I expect was their busiest hour! Very pricey too!
1736;the chicken is rubbery, not many options on the menu.  the place seems dirty and the customer service is non-existent
1737;The shawarma was tasteless.  The chef was rude.   I actually had to go to the near by gas station  to buy a candy bar after just so I could confirm my taste buds were still working.Go to Chef's door instead (either location).Just to re-iterate.  This place was so bad, I actually made a yelp account in hopes that others won't dare venture here.
1738;Terrible service. Terrible food. Terrible people. If there's one word to describe the hole it would be terribleHead south on 3rd line and eat at chefs door for some real shwrama.
1739;It used to be good but since they hired a new cook 6 mnths ago IT IS GARBAGE!  2 pieces of chicken in our so called chicken dish  all carrots! DO NOT WASTE Your TIME!
1740;Used to be my favorite place for Chinese food in town.  The last couple of times we tried it was AWFUL!!!Very little flavor.   Chicken balls are all batter with very little chicken inside.  Battered shrimp...same thing...no flavour. Cantonese Chow Men had 2 shrimp in it and was dripping in oil.We used to order fairly regularly but won't be going back.  It's time to find another place.
1741;Save your time and money, you'll end up waiting 15 min to even get a waiter to come to your table, let's not even talk about their attitude. Gave this place 2 tries we thought first time was an off night...nope! Same thing both times ended up walking out
1742;Very cold atmosphere. It feels like eating in a dungeon. Considering the location of this "pub ", the food does not even have to be good, which it isn't, to be successful. A half decent atmosphere with mediocre service and some cold craft beer is all it takes to be successful in this area. I am dumbfounded how this place has gone so awry. They need to put some stuff on the walls, give it a warmer feel and replace the horrible tin can speakers with a proper sound system. I really wanted this place to be good as it is a block from my home. If they make some changes, I'll give it another go, but until then, I ll walk 20min to the next pub down St. Clair Ave West.
1743;I just moved into the area and I was excited to check out the wychwood pub as it was just around the corner from me and could have been my new regular spot. Unfortunately it was such a disappointing outing I don't think I will ever go back. When we walked in there was one guy at the bar so very quiet. We grabbed a table and I'm not big on beer so I grabbed a drink menu. I ordered a margarita and the waitress (who seemed totally sweet) looked worried and said I'm not sure if she (being the bartender) can make it. I was confused as I ordered off the menu that I was given. When the waitress came back to the table she said that they didn't have a blender so they couldn't make it. I said that was fine I actually wanted it over ice not blended. Then she said well we only have bar lime. The price of the drinks were already kind of high and the fact that they didn't want to help basically the only customers that they had in the bar caused us to leave. I heard that this place was on restaurant makeover already, but It
1744;Formerly Legends Bar & Grill, Wychwood Pub seems to appeal to a younger and more diverse crowd but their offerings are the same (the menu still reads Legends) and the quality remains low. The decor has improved a lot but some areas still need work (like the stained carpeted stairs and the below average bathrooms).Let's start with the beers: Coors, Coors Lite, Bud Lite, Molson something, Rickards Red, Keiths, and ok, Creemore.....you get the picture. But how can a bar today have that selection of beer on tap? It just can't happen anymore! Where are the micro brews? Where are the local beers?Then there's the food: there's been no upgrade in the quality of food since the Legends days. On the menu you will find "New York Wings" - what are those?! Well I had them and they are not good. Not even pub-level quality! Fries were soggy and flavourless. Steer clear of the food at all costs. Speaking of costs, it is expensive to dine at Wychwood Pub. 2 ciders will set you back $16 and a fries add-on to your sandwich i
1745;The last review was one of the funniest things I've read in ages.  No, they don't serve chicken and I'm not suprirsed that they're not all that food-oriented. There are a few similar places along this strip which cater to what could charitably be termed the 'prolific weekday drinker'.  Not sure if TCH is the worst...Teddy's Sports Bar and Queen's (yellow sign) a few doors east could give them a run for their money but yeah, the sign is kind of cool.  By The Way Cafe in the Annex used to have an old 'Chicken' themed sign and it was kind of charming so I can see how someone might want to hope that this place would offer similar charm.  Alas....
1746;DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!THEY DO NOT HAVE CHICKEN!!!!Today I biked over to New Tasty Chicken House to check it out because their sign is so endearing.  I cannot stress enough, that you NOT GO HERE.  If it had been dark out, I would have been scared.THIS IS NOT AN EATERY.  This is a dirty, dirty, dirty dive bar, where my entrance was greeted with 'isn't that a pretty new face' by a man in his 50s with only half his teeth.  THEY ONLY SERVE OLD MILWAUKEE AND DORITOS HERE.Do not go here.  Is the end of my review.  NEVER go here.  (and they don't have chicken).
1747;The sign says Tasty Chicken House, the food inspection sign says New Tasty Chicken House.  Let's think about that name:New - Nothing here is new.  On the contrary, everything is old.  The building, the furniture inside, the TV, the bench outside, the customers.  ESPECIALLY the customers.Tasty - I suppose the beer and chips could be tasty to some, but it's tough to stomach anything with the "scenery".Chicken - There is absolutely no chicken at the New Tasty Chicken House.  NoneHouse - As I mentioned - it's a run down building.  I don't think anybody lives here.  At least, I hope not.The most prominent feature here are the people smoking outside.and the people who have just finished their cigarettes drinking bottles of beer inside.  They stare at you with faces that only many years of rough living can create.  This place is beyond the frontier of the wave of gentrification that is sweeping across Leslieville.  Its days are numbered.  For now, go here if you want to slum it, but you're not going to h
1748;Yep, no chicken.  There are dive bars and there are derelict bars. This is the later.  But hey, we all need someplace to drink. Now, I actually know someone who goes here. He's smart, well read, quite interesting.  He's the guy with the tattered book, a faded black eye, and the perfect, most pinpoint accurate insult waiting for you.  This place is for him, not you.  Don't go.  You can't handle it. It's too gross, real, and you won't understand the IOU system. It's beyond linear thought.
1749;Not sure this review is even necessary now that I've read through the rest.Just started working in the area and was looking for a lunch spot. Stepped into this dank, dark "Chicken house". A few people were drinking a lot of beer at the table closest to the window, the rest of the place looked closed.I walked up the the counter and a young woman looked confuse by my presence. Stupidly I asked about a menu or "anything"?I was told, the kitchen is closed.I don't think the kitchen has ever been open.So gross. How do these places stay open? Are they just fronts for other activities?
1750;One of the great mysteries in my life encompasses just what the hell goes on at The New Tasty Chicken House.  I have, only on occasion, been brave enough to casually peep into it's dirty windows, (ok, well, with sunglasses on, as to avoid eye contact), and have yet to spot a peice of chicken.  Or anything that could be considered tasty, for that matter.  Even what I did see made me nervous.   I think it might be cursed.  Grubby tables.  Lost souls.  Missing teeth.  And a juke box?  It boggles.  Maybe one day it will be what the once dive bars on Ossington are now, when gentrification takes over the East End.  Tasty's will start offering up a tasty of grub chic to all the cool kids, and we can say that it isn't the same as it used to be.  Or maybe not.
1751;This honestly was one of the worst places myself and my partner have been to. The food was super bland ( I had the steak and mushroom pie) and it tasted like dog food. The mashed potatoes and vegetables were cold and and had no seasoning to them. As for the wings they were very small and were nothing to write home about. The service was not good, the waitress didn't know the menu and wasn't very talented (took away pints before they were done). She should of written down the orders and she had made a mistake on the meals. She did try her best but it seemed she was in over her head. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone if they wanted to go for food, but the restaurant itself looked nice and I would maybe try to go for a drink but nothing else.
1752;I called and asked what type of crowd do they usually get young or old. In which the server (I assume) replied: it's really busy here. I said ok thanks bye as that seems red flag so I decided to look elsewhere.  My girlfriend called to ask the same question, figured we'd give them another shot. She called, they answered and my girlfriend asked the same question. The server replied "I can't here you" my girlfriend then repeated her question only to be hung up on halfway through the sentence. Now usually I don't bother with yelp or other rating systems, but that was disgusting treatment for potential customers. Get your sh*t together kingsman.
1753;I went to Godfather lounge  with my friends on a Friday night for a dinner and some Shisha and a cup of Arabic coffee. From only the look the food didn't appeal to us, so we didn't even bother to order anything to eat. The service was bad! Although, we were the only group there it took them 20 min to only prepare 4 hookahs and two cups of coffee. There was only one person on the floor, he didn't even write down our orders, so he forgot and mixed them, and didn't even remember any!The hookah flavors' were bad and tasted old. Also, the coffee tastes like coffee wash but nothing like Arabic coffee.TLet alone telling us the price per hookah was $10 then when we got there and ordered our hookahs we were charged $20!!The manager has the worst attitude for a manager! when we asked him for the wifi password he didn't want to give it to us, instead he asked to enter it himself on our devices! Like who does that! Absolutely wasn't a night anyone would expect to have on a Friday night! I won't recommend th
1754;As an avid shawarma enthusiast this was easily the worst I have ever had and likely the worst meal I have eaten in Toronto since moving here 14 months ago. I ordered the chicken shawarma plate. The chicken meat was extremely dry (and had a burnt taste), little sauce was used, and no pickled vegetables or potatoes were included with the plate. Above that the service was extremely slow. My friends and I were the only three customers in the store and it took 15 minutes for the man behind the counter to fulfill our orders. He insisted on doing each one separately and having each person pay before beginning the next meal . I can only recommend you walk the extra 5-10 minutes North on Yonge to M'Zaar which makes a meal 10x the quality for the same price.
1755;The owner of this restaurant is pure evil and a thief.He was hired to cater for an evening and had provided a nice sample as a preview, but what he delivered was so bad and such small quantity that it wasn't even worth to serve to beggars. When we complained about it, he accused us of having bad manners before apologising.This guy will hopefully not be in business for long.
1756;With all chicken meat in the plate half of them are skin. and definitely no flavor for the shawarma. the guy behind the counter use his hand to touch the food and the cash i give to him.. feel bad.
1757;Says they're open until 12am, went in at 11:04pm and wouldn't serve us. Little ridiculous. Past 4 times have tried to order a panini and machine is still "not working" or wasn't "set up". Don't go, not worth it.
1758;I just purchased a Subway tuna sandwich at this location and when I got back to my hotel there was a long 10 inch black hair running through my sandwich??? Don't these people understand you have to wear hairnets Disgusting!!!!I called the next day to speak to the manager and I told him I was a customer that found a hair in my sandwich and he said I can't hear you ?I can't hear you?? He heard my name but did not want to hear my complaint obviously?
1759;Stopped to use the bathroom and grab a quick coffee.Service was super slow stood for about 10 minutes before someone took my order.
1760;Going to BK is always out of hunger and not preference, and this experience will explain why. I'm not a very picky eater and like things plain. Ordered chicken fries and typically tasted like they had been sitting for hours.  No big deal was as expected. The next one shocked me. The BK pulled pork I ordered plain, no toppings no extra sauce. The hockey puck of pork was dry and felt as if it had been compressed with a patty maker.This has put me off of BK for now .
1761;The food was cheap, did not get much shawarma , customer service was brutal!!!! Got over charged and the lady made no effort to give me change! Completely ignorant saying mistake happen and it's ok (it's ok?!!! ForWho, not me) she wanted nothing to do with me or my concerns with anything she simply walked away. For a business which will surely fail less then a year, more effort would be required to Any normal business owner!! Would never go back again!!!!!
1762;Overcharged me then didn't refund me because they were 'busy' food was awful and way under portioned. If you are in the area I highly recommend a street rat medium rare rather then Ill Gut I mean Grill Hut!!
1763;expensive.  the staff seemed slow to understand my order.  I bought some samosas and they tasted like week-old fried lumps of compacted skin flakes from a bum's asscrack.  The bottom of the barrel.  I would rather go to mcdonald's.
1764;Got two tacos on soft shells. $6 total. One chicken, one beef. Beef was good.. but kind of fell apart. Chicken was watery and chewy. Had a weird texture to it.. ugh! Service was super nice but the food itself was totally underwhelming!
1765;Terrible experiences spanning multiple occasions. Having lived in BC for a few years, I was really impressed with the Taco Time locations out there. Enough so that when I learned there was one in Ajax, I decided to mission up there anytime I could. Well, after four tries, and long drives to get there - I'm done. This location is absolutely nothing like their BC counterparts. The portions are smaller, the ingredients far less fresh, and there's just something seriously missing in the flavour. Each time I've gone, there has been some kind of error or problem with my order. The final straw was taking a detour up there while heading home on the 401 west. I ordered a large Super Beef with a large Mexi-Fries Deluxe. My receipt reflected this. I get home and open the bag to find a tiny, barely-filled burrito that was literally 1/3rd the size and deliciousness of what I'd had in Vancouver, and a regular sized, regular Mexi-Fries. I was the only customer in there, so this wasn't some mix-up.I hope that thi
1766;I made a mistake of eating at this place. I had 2 hard shell chicken tacos and 1 nacho deluxe. Chicken was bland and very watery. It looks like it just came from the freezer to the table top food warmer. Taco shells were stale and toppings were not fresh at all. Nacho deluxe with beef tasted disgusting. Beans was watered down because when I walked in she was actually adding water in to bean pan thats already cooked. They do this so that it won't dry out and the only time the bean pan will dry out if you have no costumers buying food. The nachos were stale also and placed under a heat lamp that was not working. The meal cost including a small drink was $16 which I thought was very expensive when you're are just going to puke it out after. One thing good about this place is the big screen TV with sports channel. I expect this to go under in 6 months just for the sake of their lease rental agreement.
1767;One of the worst restaurant experiences we have had. From the service to the food, all terrible and definetely not reccomended. Stale tacos, food sitting out for hours likely and when we expressed our concerns about the food not being fresh, they played the "racism" card on us. Unbelievable! Stay away as there are a LOT of better options to eat in the area.
1768;The only thing worse than the people working at this store is the horrible food and portions they serve. Pathetic customer service, un-eatable food, and expensive prices are what you get. Never will I go to this horrible place again and no one should either.
1769;Atrocious service. Got served a plate of shawarma. Didn't even get the peppers onions etc. This particular employee just stood there didn't ask what salad I wanted. Then he said "choose a drink." with the worst attitude possible. Couldn't even say "Would you like a drink with that?" As if that wasn't rude enough, this guy throws the drink onto the tray, not once, but TWICE. Because he tried to charge me $2.49 for a CAN of iced tea when the screen said 600ml bottle. I asked why it was $2.49 he said it's the same for everything. Why on earth would I ever pay $2.49 for a can of pop at a food court? These guys think they're running a movie theatre? So I chose a bottle instead and again he tosses it onto the tray. I don't even care what the food tastes like after service like that. NEVER returning to this location again. I will be sure to tell everyone I know not to eat here when at Yorkdale.
1770;I had some of the chicken skewers with rice and the food was horrible.  They over charged me and even though no one was really there, they rushed and did a sloppy job of putting my food together. ..... quality here has gone down since the new food court opened. ALL the sauces wrre extremely watered down.
1771;Omg, what a joke, they were constantly harassing people with free chicken samples, but I was trying to order and they couldn't focus on providing me with my order.  They didn't offer any sauces, over charged me, and gave me a small portion for a platter.  Never again... Can see why no one was eating here.
1772;Their falafels are salty and dry. Their coleslaw has no dressing to it its just dry you need flavour.  I've tried the chicken skewers and their potatoes not too bad.  They charge a lot for your food too expensive for not so good food. I've tried the Villa Madina at Square One AMAZING! That place is a must try.  Their coleslaw has moist to it, dressing is so delicious. Their potatoes are actually better  and so is their chicken skewers more flavour than the ones at Yorkdale.  I give Villa Madina Square One a 5 star!
1773;Worse service and food quality even by fast food standards. My shawarma was cold as ice, and they were very stingy with the meat and sauces. My potatoes were barely filled to the rim of the bowl with a tiny dab of sauce on top. Apparently they didn't have any straws, so I had to drink straight out of the paper cup! It was quite a long wait even though we were the only people there. I guess it's becuase the workers spent a lot of the time talking with each rather than actually completing my order.
1774;Just went came back from lunch.  The worst food I've had at Yorkdale.  I've been going there since it opened and it was always good.  Today, it tasted like left overs heated up.  Maybe it's a Sunday thing.  The chicken skewers were like shoe leather,  the rice was overly salted and Falafel was god awful (cold and hard).  Too bad.  Won't be going back.
1775;This is easily the worst thing I've eaten all year. Got a beef shawarma. First of all it was terribly made. Not sure if the bread was ancient but it was literally falling apart. And not because it was stuffed. The bread just couldn't support the stingy contents. There was very little meat. All I could see really was bread, bread and more bread. When it eventually collapsed I could make out some tomatoes too. This is easily the stingiest made shawarma I've had. Finally service was pretty bad. They keep trying to pressure you to get the combo which I didn't want
1776;TERRIBLE!I agree with what has been said earlier. There's a guy literally harassing people with his chicken samples. Once I order something, they seem to be annoyed.The girl at the tile seems to hate her life and was acting super rude, throwing napkins at me. They did not offer any sauce at the end and I had to ask for her to add some and she only did it for one box. I just got home and the beef is completely burnt and disgusting ( I can post a picture if anyone is interested). I can't believe you serve that kind of food to your customers!!! It's embarrassing and the manager must not care about his business if he hires people like that.PLUS: they overcharged me!!! I decided to go to Yorkdale today just for the Lebanese food because I did remember their friendly staff and fresh food in the past. They must have changed owners and I will never ever go there again and  will make sure to spread the word so no one goes there again!
1777;This place was a disappointment to say the least. My friend Stephanie and I went to have a girls meal together after not seeing one another for a long time. We ordered food which took at least 50 minutes (we thought they had forgot) to arrive at our table. We were a bit shaken but I'm not one to complain so we started eating it. The chips I had ordered were rock hard and disgusting and the sandwhich was miniscule and just plain bad. I never ask for discounts but I couldn't bring myself to pay almost 30$ (overpriced) for such a terrible meal. I complained and got us a slight discount but never again. We overheard others complaining as well - its just plain bad.
1778;I don't usually jump to a 1 star review because every place can have an off day. It's different if it's every day.The beer is flat....if they give you the right beer. My bf had a hard enough time trying to get a beer that wasn't flat, I didn't bother telling them they gave me the wrong beer. The basic foods are good, but there's nothing made in house. I asked about a few dishes that are my 'go-to' the server was honest and admitted they were not made in house. Blah.The service was ok, but it's been practically empty every time I've been there.That location must be cursed, nothing there seems to last.
1779;This was hands-down the worst restaurant I have ever been to.  I've never shit so much in my life, and I've been to Thailand. Thanks Honest Lawyer!  On the plus side, a couple of the waitresses had nice cans.
1780;The food here was mediocre... The service was extremely rushed - I had my server standing over me waiting for me to finish each course. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant and won't be back.
1781;We came here for a summerlicous. It was also our very first. Not knowing what to expect we ordered our meal. We got the first course pretty quickly however my salad had quiet a bit of dirt in it. It took more then an hour to get the second course and it was a steak Very well done when I had asked for medium rare. The desert was awful too. One of the worst meals I have had in the city for sure!
1782;Went to Toula for summerliciuous.  I hope the staff read this.  Your in the "wow" business.  But for $23 I should not expect to be wowed.   3 choices of wine.  I tried the $50 red from Chili and opted for Italian for 55.  Both wines were terrible.I started with minestrone soup.  It was blaBefore I could finish soup I watch the server come out with our next dishes.   We haven't finished soup or salad.  He walks back....waits for me to finish and brings my lamb shank on saffron  rice.  COLD AND NOT TASTY.My guest had the chicken.  Over cooked and coldCreme Brule was great.  Though server brought me curled milk for coffee.46 for food55 for wineTotal= WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.And some please have the severs clean their black uniforms.  That just shows me one thing....Anyway.  Not going back.  Restaurant needs a reno and upgrade with food and wineLater.
1783;Do notcomehereon winterlicious.Arrived at 8.25 PM for an 8.30 reservation, still not seated at 9.15. The waiting area is packed like a rush hour streetcar. Other folks are probably getting seated tomorrow.
1784;The location of the restaurant is easy to get to but parking was a joke.  $40 flat rate for valet parking?  Are you kidding me?  And of course the hotel did not offer parking which I found surprising as most hotels in Toronto do.  I had to drop off my 90 year old grandmother at the doors and then went to 3 different lots to find parking (all which were either $15 or $20) and then had to walk all the way back in my high heels.  So far not a good start.  What I thought was odd as well was that the restaurant called me literally 30 minutes prior to my dinner reservation to confirm that I was coming.  Odd.  I would think they would call to confirm earlier in the day or the day before.  When we got to the restaurant we were seated right away and had a view of Lake Ontario (very nice view).  The service was prompt though I found the waiter to hover a lot while we were dining.  We ordered some drinks and the Blue Hawaiian tasted like it had no alcohol in it and the Peach Cobbler was so strong that you already felt 
1785;This place is a SCAM!!!!! I bought a wagjag voucher for this place and went with my boyfriend because I wanted to give him a nice present and a beautiful evening. It was supposed to be a nice 4 course dinner and it gave us the menu of what to choose. We both chose the sea bass since we don't eat meat. We were expecting to get a delicious sea bass but what they actually served is was tilapia! Everyone knows tilapia is much less expensive than sea bass so when i asked him what it is he said it was "european sea bass". Now I know for next time that that means tilapia. As for the dessert course what really got my mouth watering on the menu was the home made peach tart with hazelnut ice cream. When it came time to order it the waiter told me they dont have peach only pear so I went with pear which was a bad choice! It was dry and disgusting and there was no ice cream that came with it either! Overall it was a bad experience and I would not go back
1786;This restaurant is an utter disappointment. I decided to give them a chance despite the plethora of negative reviews and it was a total regret. I went for their Winterlicious dinner with a couple friends. Our reservation was for 5pm, the first reservation slot mind you. This did NOT change the outcome of the terrible food. The only good thing about this restaurant is the view. Very nice. Now, the food?? Completely disgusting. Everything, with the exception of the Cannolata Siciliana, tasted like it came from a can or a hospital. Bland was not the word. To make matters worse, I think they gave me the tiniest lobster tail I have ever seen in my life. I've had crawfish that were bigger than it. FURTHERMORE, it had a mushy, flaky texture like fish which was very odd. I was scared to eat it and had to order another one. Which wasn't much better. At that point I was over it. My friend's steak which she ordered as medium, came out pretty much well done. Now on to service. We had a "new" server. No excuse in my b
1787;Do not go to this restaurant. If I could give negative ratings, I would. I had heard both good and bad things about this restaurant, so I finally decided to try it myself. I came here for summerlicious 2016. Arrived at about 7:45 and our first dish came around 8pm. The first course was scallops and smoked salmon, it was quite good so my hopes were high. The next course took over 45 mins and a conversation with the manager before it finally arrived closer to 9pm. Everything ranged from mediocre to extremely disappointing.
1788;The view & service was excellent.  However the food was probably one of the worst I have tasted in many years!  Cornish hen was burnt, seabass was dry & salty :( stick with drinks & desserts only!
1789;So I was here yesterday for Winterlicious. I heard from a few friends that Toula isn't good but I decided to give it a try anyway. After last night, I will never return again.People usually come here for the view but since it was so foggy and snowy, the view was only okay. I think going in summer would be better.The food took me by surprise - in a bad way. I ordered the lobster martini for appetizer. It was cheaply made - two tiny pieces of "lobster" and the rest is all salad. I got the steak for main course, but the portion was so small that I thought I was having an afternoon snack. Like seriously, it was super small that my stomach was only half full after the whole meal. I got a chocolate parfait for dessert, but my own homemade parfait would've tasted much better than theirs.Here's the worst part, SERVICE. When we got our bills, we were told we couldn't get separate bills, but we could still pay separately. We expected the waiter to bring us the visa machine that you would normally see at any other
1790;Worse $30 meal ever!  Went there as a group of 6 for Winterlicious lunch.  Unfriendly staff but if the food was decent we would have overlooked the bad service.  Ordered seafood soup which had drips of liquid and leftover salmon chunks, defrosted calamari, and overboiled pasta.  One spoonful of this fishy soup concoction I stopped eating.  Ordered chicken thighs which on the entire plate had 2 thumb-sized chicken chunks too dry to cut with knife and absolutely no flavour.  One bite of this I stopped eating.  Dessert was the only thing I ate which was a small square of tiramisu which was probably purchased from a bakery.  Non-stop complaints from tables near us but manager didn't care and gave us bills with 18% gratuity included.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY/TIME going to this restaurant!!
1791;I went here for winterlicious dinner and it was a HORRIBLE experience to say the least.We made a reservation, however that seemed pointless considering they still made us wait 45 minutes to be seated.  Starving by the time we were seated, we already new exactly what we wanted to eat.  However, it took our waited 30 mins after being seated just to get a glass of water.  After we ordered, it took another 45 mins to get our bite sized appetizer.  Then another HOUR until we got our main.  By the time we left, we had been there for 4 hours.  It seemed as if none of their staff had worked at a restaurant before.  The portions were so small and the wait was so long that we left here still starving and picked up food on the way home.I would not recommend this place at all.
1792;I stayed in Westin and went there for summerlicious. The service and food are terrible. Cannot be worse.
1793;Wow. I didn't think TOULA would be so disgusting. Service was horrible. Food was TERRIBLE and service was even worse! Arrived and was treated curtly by the host. No service for 15 minutes, I went to grab the water pitcher myself and poured my friend and I water. Appetizers came. Smoked salmon tasted like it was out of the package and my friends scallops were overcooked and slimey.Main course came. Friend got chicken, which was tasteless and dry. My order was wrong, I ordered steak and received a salmon. Steak came 10 minutes later.. it was slightly burnt.  The mashed potatoes tasted like 50 cents from a box and the vegetables I couldn't even touch. Dessert was the only decent part tasted like the boxes of cheesecake you buy at a supermarket. I do not know what witchcraft they're using to stay afloat. Only ever come here for the view and perhaps some alcohol to tolerate being in this crappy place wow. Thought to myself I'd rather have a cheeseburger from McDonalds than be sitting on those plastic chairs
1794;Tasteless and overpriced! View is great but with a hefty price to pay for the disappointing food plus parking cost! Service was super slow and overall a bad experience
1795;The worst food and service I've ever experienced I've been there for the new year eve 2015 it was a disaster , bad food rotten meat angry and aggressive owner and staff I wish if I could rate it zero
1796;Attended new year's party at this restaurant and it was the worst dining experience ever. For the price of admission and dinner I could have been in the Caribbean for a week...instead got marginal service and steak that was lukewarm and not cooked to my liking...I asked for coffee 3 times...never got it..Such a great way to celebrate my anniversary and new years eve at the same time...Did I mention that the bathroom is on a different floor.. using back staircase.Never again!
1797;I had been to this restaurant for a great Winterlicious meal and chose to go back for a special celebration - what a mistake - especially the food.  We ordered scallop appetizer - there was sand in the scallops and they were undercooked and bland.  Tried the mushroom appetizer - sauteed mushrooms in a slimy sauce that had no taste.  The pasta with lobster was horrible - had a terrible tinny taste.  The veal special was delicious.  The shrimp and tuna pasta was not bad.  2 out of 3 of us came home not feeling well.  They were also out of 2 of their regular pasta dishes at 7 pm on a Friday night??????It it wasn't for our waitress who was attentive, polite and understanding it would have been a horrible evening.  View was good - for an expensive "high end" restaurant, most people were very under-dressed and I would think hotel guests.  We should have stuck with our favourite restaurants that are 5 minutes from home - next year!
1798;Not calling it overpriced, cause it has such a great view of the city, but their menu is really simple, yet not too impressive. So you should be prepared to pay for the view instead of the food. The service is alright, but the management is ridiculous. The manager is not very well organized himself and is disrespectful to people. If you order cocktails, be prepared to have different taste for each glass. If you order meat, remember to double check how rare or well-done you want it to be. If you order a bottle of wine, just be patient cause they have no idea where to find it either.Fortunately they are a hotel restaurant with a great view, or they're probably long gone in an area with so many other great restaurants.
1799;Horrible food!!!! No! No! No! Don't do it! Everything was bland. The food quality was poor and extremely overpriced. Genuinely the grossest steak I've ever had in my life. $51 for 8oz with absolutely no flavour, it was bearable with added salt. Seafood spaghetti was a joke, defrosted seafood on a bed of undercooked spaghetti & lots of salt. Our waitress (mackalya) was very nice, pleasant and professional. Although we were initially greeted by someone else who was the opposite of nice and pleasant. Nice wine selection, and amazing view. But I wouldn't give more than one star. I can't express how horrible the food is. Just don't dine here. $300 : for one appetizer, $50 bottle of wine and two mains, you can do a lot better in the city.
1800;Bad. Bad bad service. We had a reservation but still waited for 1.5 hour. I walked around and noticed only 2/3 of the restaurant was filled up. The hostess was an idiot. Food was mediocre. It was Not Fine dining.
1801;Overpriced, outdated and the slowest service I have ever experienced. Tragic for such a unique location
1802;Went for a dinner with my boyfriend for Valentine's Day , place is nice food was decent wasn't really happy with the server that was serving me kinda gross caught him picking his nose and then putting the Remains in a serving napkin , was very disgusted by this and still thinking about it till this day he also served me water and something was floating in it (in the back of my mind his booger) and ended up drinking my boyfriends water as a result.. Defiantly will not be returning to this restaurant and wouldn't recommend it unless you are interested in eating human remains
1803;OH MY, I really, really wish I read the reviews first before my visit to Toula.  We read the summerlicious menu and it sounded great- but it was honestly one of the worst meals we've ever had.  Honestly, save your money and by street meat (hot dog cart), the hot dog will guaranteed be better!!!  Apps- Husband order Cheese & Salami Platter -Amazing (why they get the .5 star). And only because they didn't have COOK it as it was imported.  I ordered the swordfish raw over salad- not good- very plain.Main- Husband ordered beef tenderloin cooked to perfect but a little cool and the peas sauce it was over had a light layer of dry crust- proving it to have been sitting around for a while.  I order the gnocchi- NO WAY That was fresh!!!!  Worse then frozen gnocchi.  Sandy, starchy flavorless mess.  I for the first time sent a plate back- never done that before. They brought the lobster pasta instead.  Dry & hard previously freezer burnt lobster overcooked.  But I forced it down to be polite.  Neither dishes were fla
1804;Oh God, I really wish I had dived into reviews before coming over. I usually check reviews for everything but since this was a Westin, I thought I'd be safe. I thought WRONG. The reviews are TRUE. Do not waste your money or frankly your TIME. My friends and I went out for a winterlicious dinner and received 3 courses over THREE HOURS. INSANE. We sat for a half hour before we even got our bread. Should of just gotten up and left. Our waiter was MIA for the majority of the night and also not friendly. Wait staff can really change the quality of your evening, and he frankly brought it right down. No one was happy with their food. My girlfriend's chicken was dry and flavourless, my steak was burnt & overcooked (medium well as opposed to medium rare) and my girlfriend's ravioli, which she asked for served with butter, was served with sauce. Desserts were a miss. Bland. My salad came undressed. I don't know who this restaurant is for, but certainly not anyone who knows food. Maybe someone whose tastebuds were
1805;I was here on Thursday night with my partner for our 6th wedding anniversary. The restaurant is participating in Summerlicious so we thought it would be a good opportunity to try it out. Service: I've read a lot of bad things about the service but our waiter was good. He did say they were out of a lot of stuff we tried to order though, which was disappointing.Food: For appetizers I ordered the cheese and meat board. It came with three different meats - 2 each of the thinnest slices I've ever seen. Of what I could taste, it seemed like something I would find in the packaged meat section of the grocery store. My husband ordered prawns and he got literally 2! And not only that, it was just tossed on a plate with juices running everywhere - no presentation.For main I ordered the Lamb Ragout which was nothing exciting. Underseasoned and boring. My husband ordered the filet which he asked to be cooked medium but was charred on the outside and barely pink on the inside. Portion was too small.Dessert was also
1806;I wouldn't even give them a star if It was an option. We went to Toula in a group of 13 guests. I was really looking forward for it because it's "high-class fine dining" supposingly! However, we were extremly disappointed. The food was terrible! I ordered an appetizer (crab cake with avocado) and it was $25. It had a very strong fishy unpleasant smell and taste! It was not worth the price!I personally ordered rack of lamb. The meat was soso and it's overprices for the quality of meat. The flavour was soso. It was dry. The worst part was the side dishes (potatoes), one of them gone bad. Well, it was just one not big deal so I didn't mention about it! However, I did later and you will see why.One of my friend ordered Gnocchi and it tasted like powder was was uncooked covered in cheese. She didn't eat her meal! My other friend ordered salmon steak! It was so rough and fully cooked that by the time she had 3/4 of the salmon, her inner mouth wasBleeding. The service was also not good! The waiter kept on 
1807;should have read the yelps before going. VERY underwhelming experience. waiter/maitre'd was annoying. kept hurrying us along and topping off our wine suggesting it was time to go. a wasted $150 in my opinion. my date would agree. will NEVER return.
1808;I've been disappointed by winterlicious in the past but thought I'd give it another shot. The menu looked inspired so i was really excited. First impressions: the decor was out dated, the hostess was unpleasant. Not off to a good start. We were seated and the view was impressive. Our server took our order and before I had time to blink our appetizers had arrived. I ordered the caprese salad and my husband got a mushroom and polenta dish. My salad was average - over dressed and topped with an unnecessary slice of avacado. The mushroom dish was terrible - luke warm and very beige. Not appetizing at all. We ordered a wine pairing - 2 glasses of wine to accompany your appetizer and main for $12. A good deal! We waited a while for our mains to arrive, but not too long. I ordered AAA fillet and my husband ordered pasta with a lobster tail. The steak had nice flavor and the sides (mash potatoes and asparagus) were ok. I enjoyed most of my steak but as i got towards the middle (and the end) my medium rare ste
1809;Food was sub par for the price. Decor was outdated and gratuity included on a bill more than 100$ for 2 summerlicious deals. One saving grace is the view.....but windows were dirty
1810;This review is for winterlicious 2014. One word to sum up the whole event: sucked- Service sucked: lemon for water came 20min later, heating air is too strong that made so dried for me to sit around, coffee came way later than sugar and milk, milk container had old aged yellow line which was pretty gross. Coffee- worse than my church coffee- watered down, no taste coffee. Can't even get coffee right, so should I even say more about food? - Food sucked: food? I'm sorry, was that "food" we consumed and paid for? Parking: really expensive. 6.5$ every half hour. I guess I'm really paying for the view.
1811;Food: Came here for a friend's birthday, ordered off the their pre-fixe lunch menu, main course choice between veal with saffron risotto, salmon with lemon parsley risotto, and chicken with parmigiano. When they brought the meals, all the veal meals were served with some veggies and without the saffron risotto as stated on the menu, all the lemon parsley risotto had too much lemon and was too sour, more than two chicken meals were served with undercooked chicken. Service: Servers spoke to each other loudly in a non-English language very close to our table. When we finished our meals, we were not offered coffee or tea, we had to ask for it. It also took an extremely long time to process our payments.Overall: If you get the right table, the view is pretty gorgeous. Besides that, I would probably never go to this restaurant again since the price of the meal was not worth the mediocre food or service.
1812;We were surprised by the experience over all for a downtown high end restaurant. I start with parking, we arrived and no valet parking and the service man at the door send you to a nearby outdoor parking for 30 dollars instead of a nearby building which was 15. It took us 15-20 min to find it.The food was not good, and the service even worse. Salad came as if it was taken off the salad mix bag and thrown on the plate. No taste, flavour.Sea bas comes with Black Olive, Sundried Tomato & Caper Tapenade Crust, with Risotto and Zucchini (on paper), however it came with only Risotto and zucchini with the fish on top, and when you ask the waiter why it was missing other ingredients as per the menu, the answer was more insulting to our intelligence as he said "its mixed with the Risotto and you can smell it "!We asked for the manager (Kenny) and to be honest he was quite nice and professional and apologized for what happened and offered free coffee, deserts and took the sea bas off the bill and he did acknowledg
1813;I came here around 12pm with my cousin - based on the restaurant's website, the restaurant advertised that they have brunch, and even had photos of it. So, we went assuming we would go have brunch.When we get there, the menu looks like they have dinner items only - who us 10 oz. strip loin at 12 in the afternoon?! Confused that these were not brunch items, we ask the waiter for the correct menu and his response was "We haven't done brunch for years..." Um....okay, so why was it advertised in its website?The fact that they haven't done brunch for years and yet, have not changed the website is baffling to me and very deceptive to customers. If you don't have brunch, then take it off your website so you can avoid the onslaught of angry customers.Obviously, my cousin and I walked out of the restaurant, as we weren't about to have dinner at 12pm. The view was great, but not impressive. Also, there were creepy looking bugs on the outside of the windows! Gross!Shame on you, Toulla, for your deceptive adverti
1814;Worst experience ever. Made reservations for winterlicious in advance. On the day of they claimed that they dont do reservations. Horrible service. Washroom is beyond ghetto, looks like a service stop washroom. Washroom smelled so bad. Only 1 out of 5 washrooms worked the rest were flooded. Food is not that great. There was a fly in my sisters water. Save your money. Go somewhere else.
1815;I went to Toula today with a few friends for summerlicious. Very disappointing experience overall, and I would suggest to spend your money somewhere else.+ The view. Simply amazing- The food: our menu was $20 (summerlicious deal) which was a great suprise. However, the food was below average, no one really enjoyed their meal. I had some fresh, hand made pasta, which was anything but fresh. Dessert (Tiramisu) was tasteless.  - The rip-off: I was drinking sparkling water, when a server tried to pour still water into my glass. I declined politely, but I was then asked why I did not want to drink... I took the time to explain that I was having sparkling. He came back with a bottle of sparkling water, poured some and apologized for his mistake. I thought he was trying to make up for his error. Instead I realized later that they actually charged me for a second bottle.- The decor. Completely outdated, needs a serious refresh. It really does not look clean. - The staff: very dirty clothes, to a point where it
1816;We came here to celebrate a birthday.  Service was (significantly) less than stellar.  Not only did it take forever to get anything, our waiter didn't know anything about the menu or cocktails.The food was just okay, but overpriced for what you're getting.  I couldn't get past the bad service and had a hard time enjoying my time there.The concept of eating way up high, especially near the water, is cool.  At night you don't really see much except for some lights from the planes coming into or leaving the island.  If you're going for the view, I would recommend just going up to have a look, but not staying for dinner.  Nothing we ordered was complicated, there were only 6 in our party and the restaurant was not very busy.  I can't come up with any excuses for the bad service.
1817;Worst dining experience ever! Deserve 0 star out of five. 11 of us went for winterlicioux last night. We were sitted at 7pm, our main dish was not even ready by 10pm. We complained to the manager, the manager offered a 50% off the entire meal and promised food will be here in exactly 15 minutes. 25 minutes later..when it finally come, the orders were all messed up, the waiters( not the one whotook our orders, that one disappeared) have no idea who ordered what, and lied to our face that is our order. When questioned why my medium rare steak is more burnt than my friend's medium well, the waiter still insist the all burnt steak is medium rare. My friend and i decided to switch, so we each get our required steak. The steak tasted awful!!! It doesnot taste any flavor, and its COLD!!!!! I think they dont know how to handle a large table, so they couldnot coordinate the timing for all main dishes to be ready at the same time.its much worse than the $15 steak in any bar. Not only it taste awful, my stomach started 
1818;My first experience here was for a wedding dinner and it would've been the last if they hadn't begged us to return for another dinner on them just to make up for the first fiasco. Service was slow, wine over priced and the food was beyond salty. I mean they couldn't get anything right. Moving forward, we returned for our dinner on the house and it was just as bad. If it wasn't for the attentive waiter I wouldn't even give this place 1 star. Sure the place has a great view but c'mon if the food is sub par you will quickly forget about the view in no time. In regards to the meal, all meat dishes we ordered had to be sent back because they literally came to the table raw. All 4 came with standard veggies and not what was indicated on the menu.I will never return here or recommend this restaurant to anyone. Sorry but the standards here are very low. Save your money.
1819;I do not consider myself a food connoisseur, but I've participated in enough Summerlicious outings to discern between the good and the bad.  Toula was just plain bad.  The only redeeming quality about the restaurant was the view, but if you wanted anything more you will be disappointed.I already heard a slew of bad reviews from acquaintances going into this dinner, but I was going for the good company.  I choose the Fresh PEI Lobster tail served on a saffron risotto cake finished with citrus buerre blanc and pink peppercorns  for the appetizer, Pesto and roasted pine nut encrusted Chilean sea bass served with saffron risotto and finished with a tarragon cream sauce for the main, and Toula triple chocolate temptation cheesecake topped with marinated blueberries for the dessert. First of all, the wait staff were terrible.  The main manager who was serving us had an unpleasant scowl on his face the entire evening and was clearly displeased with our table.  It took 20 minutes before they would even take our o
1820;- Over priced for a simple menu. Not worth the price.- Snobby staff that only take care of the older crowd that they perhaps think can afford to give a better tip, that they really do not deserve. The girls that work there do nothing but talk with an attitude and give dirty looks. No one even offered to take our coats, but every other couple there was waited on hand and foot.Apparently there is no dress code, because, while we were dressed to the nines, others were in track pants, etc which made no difference in their service either. It seemed as though we were an inconvenience, and that they were just trying to get rid of us. Even though we were extremely nice and gave our waiter an amazing tip which we really shouldn't have! Worst experience.Will never dine there again!!I've had better service at McDonalds.
1821;The worst experience ever...Do not ever come. We had reservations for 9pm. We got here for 830pm. We got our table at 9:50pm. The first meal comes at 10:52pm to be specific. I am still here waiting for my main course as I write this review. Its 11:30pm. I still have my mains and desert to go. Average time between a meal is 45-55mins. Terrible Terrible! Capacity of the place is 500 people. They booked 800.... Jeez!!!! The funniest part is that the Manager is servicing.....
1822;Stay away from Toula. Lobster tasted like chicken, steak tasted like rubber, salmon was overcooked, scales were still on the seabass. Dessert tasted like it was bought from nofrills.3 stats for service, -10 for the food. Left Toula and had to go to McDonald's to refresh my palette Stay away because you will regret the second you put their food in your mouth. Elevators seems like they're about to break down, especially the scenic elevator. Dangerous place to be.Ps. 15% Tips are automatically added to the bill also
1823;Disappointing. The food was average at best, the decor is falling apart and outdated. The waiter was good, he knew the kitchen was behind and thus brought bread, that is until the busboy decided that we weren't allowed any more bread. Maybe if the place was more organized we wouldn't have needed it. The manager was on his cell phone at the front, not really my idea of professional. The view of the harbour is good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again
1824;I was at this restaurant in early October of this year to celebrate my bachelorette party. When we got to the restaurant at 7pm (our reservation time) we waited about a full hour and a half to get our meal. When I got my meal, I noticed that the rice was undercooked. Actually it was dry and crunchy in my mouth. I called the waiter over to complain, but instead of apologizing and offering me something else, he began to argue with me, trying to explain that the rice is supposed to be that way. Anyway, he didn't back out of the argument. I told him I will not pay for the food and he just walked away. My friend then went over to speak to him and to tell him how rude he was and that she wanted to speak to the manager. Turned out that HE WAS the manager! Needless to say, we couldn't get an apology out of him, however he did subtract the dish off the bill, after endless arguments back and forth. Some people never learn how to treat their customers. Very bad service, indeed. Will not return.
1825;Oh my... this place is awful for a "high end" restaurant... NO choice for vegetarian/vegans and all they could come up with was a bland alfredo pasta. Very unhappy birthday girl!!!!
1826;Worst restaurant ever if I could gave them zero star I would.  My mom and I went for dinner and for the next 20 mins not a single person came to our table.  I even made it a point to go to one of the waiters to ask for someone to serve us and yer no one came.  Save your money and don't bother going.
1827;The beautiful views, and they are very beautiful, are hardly enough to make up for the complete lack of service, and inflated prices.The cost of soup and a cold plate of pasta was 60 dollars. I had to beg for bread, and as I said before, the ravioli was close to frozen in the middle. I am not exaggerating here, actually freezing. The experience was dulled by the fact that the food took forever to come out, and the waitress came over all of twice.  Don't waist your money.
1828;We came here for winterlicious for my birthday. There were so many options so we were excited to try it. The review for Andrea Boscherini was setting the bar really high. We were a group of 10 with reservations. We were running a tad late due to traffic but when we got there the table was set with a view of the CN tower. Mila our waitress came by right away and asked if my boyfriend and I wanted drinks while we wait for everyone else. I thought we were off to a great start!Once we all got there and our orders were taken we were anticipating some amazing food to come out. So first the appetizers. My boyfriend had the shrimp cocktail - a dry tasteless dish with some sort of disgusting jello. There were three other who got this dish. It was presented differently for each and the only thing that was consistent was how horrible it tasted. I ordered the caprese salad - another huge disappointment just looks like they cut the cheese and threw it on top not caring what it looks like. The taste was very bland.Mo
1829;**Toula, you're getting a one star because of your food.  I would give you none if I could**I made a reservation for 8 girls for my friend's bachelorette dinner.  Told the hostess to write a specific message on the dessert for my friend, and she said she'll get it done.  When we got to the restaurant, I double checked with the hostess (she was very nice) about the message on the dessert, she said it's in the computer and not to worry about it.  So we proceed to the dining table.  Me and another girl ordered their risotto, and after a 30 mins wait, the food finally arrived.  And our risotto turns out to be under cooked (the rice were still crunchy), so we told our server to kindly bring us a cooked one.  He first raised his eye brows, then asked if we know "Al dente" means, and if we know that risotto are suppose to be "Al dente" (never in a million years would I expect to be question by a server about this, especially not in a restaurant on the top floor of Westin Harbour hotel ).  I told him I've had ove
1830;Bad food options, bad services, too over priced. They tipped themselves on the bill even tho the services were crap. We literally waited for our food for 20 mins to come, and apparently the servers didn't even care. $16 for the salad, plate was huge but the actual food portion was TINY. I'd rather go get McDonald's salad than theirs. I'm giving a star just to the view, but still, I would not recommend this place to anyone.  PS. They don't take DEBIT CARD, stupid right ?:/
1831;Despite the sub-par reviews we've read on Yelp, my wife and I decided to give this restaurant the benefit of the doubt.So I made reservations for winterlicious dinner at Toula. This is how our evening played out. Took the scenic elevator up and was able to enjoy the beautiful city lights. Arrived close to 6pm on a Sunday and noticed it was quite empty, but for some reason they had difficulty finding us a table for 4... We were politely told to wait while the 2 hostesses scrambled for 10 minutes to come up with the ingenious plan of placing 2 round tables together to form a table of 4. The restaurant appeared to be overstaffed with many workers wandering aimlessly back and forth making eye contact with their hands because God forbid they actually look at the patrons to see if they have been attended to. We waited 15 minutes before we got our bread, another 10 minutes before someone noticed we didn't get our water yet and finally after 30 minutes of being seated our waitress acknowledge our existence. She a
1832;What an absolutely horrible restaurant.  The food was ok, but the service absolutely sucked.  Paid over one hundred bucks for drinks and dinner and got service worthy of Denny's.  I will not be back.  And I encourage other guest of the Westin to not patronize this disaster of a restaurant.
1833;This past Sunday my girlfriends and I decided to check out Toula for Winterlicious. This was an Italian restaurant located on the 38th floor inside the Western Harbour Castle hotel. I let me girls decided this one. My friend who has been there before decided to drive. As soon as we pulled up to the hotel the valet driver was right there to assist us. Very friendly staff working at the hotel. When were were 10 mins away we realized we were going to be late so we called to inform the restaurant. They called back to see how far we were and sounded as if they would give our table away, at that point we had just pulled into the driveway. When we arrived we told the lady at the front our names, she looked very confused as if we didn't have a reservation. We waiting about 5 mins before we were seated. My friend requested for a table by the Window when she made the reservation, lets just say we didn't get a table near the Window but super far. My my appetizer I order the Dolce Vita Salad (roasted heirloom beet sala
1834;Horrible. Everything about this dining experience was horrible (except for the view- although it was through a dirty window) and the person I was with.The risotto was raw and swimming in oil. The ravioli  was broken and one big blob. It looked like someone vomited on my plate. Expensive and one of the worst meals I have ever had.
1835;The food is not worth the price, the service is really bad. I go to Toula every year and the quality is getting worse and worse. This year I decided to give it a last chance to see if they have improvement or not, but sadly it is even worse than before. I really like the view there, but I can't stand the waiters there. Our waiter asked if we want to have wine once we sit down, TWO TIMES. After he got the answer no, he became really rude to us. Then he took our order impatiently without any confirmation. Food took ages to arrive and not worth the wait! Not what you expected to have in high-end restaurant but more like what you got at home.  The waiter didn't remember what we ordered so every time when the food arrived, he either ask "who order this, who order that" or just put the food in front of us randomly so we have to change it by ourselves.The waiter didn't even ask if we want black pepper but I saw him behaved ingratiatingly to the large group of people next to our table who ordered some white wines.
1836;Not impressive with the food and decor, service is pretty good tho, this is my first time here, and it will the last time.
1837;THE FOOD WAS SHIT!!!!!!!!HORRIBLE!!!!!!"mushroom soup" tasted and looked like grinded mushrooms in hot waterthe shrimp...omg almost threw up after spitting it out! so gross!gnocci...over cooked making it chewycheese...didn't even taste like cheesesteak...not so good and served with arugala... no potatoes or vegetables!  Since when?!Desert...come on how can you screw that up?!  Well of course they did!  the "chocolate cake" had no taste!  Cake from a box even has taste!  I don't understand how an expensive restaurant can serve such crappy food!oh and a beer....$9
1838;Horrible dining experience. Went once for Winterlicious and another time for the regular menu.  Big mistake.For Winterlicious, the food is cold and the plates are all premade that they form hard crusts on the outside (for example on the risotto).  They also have this weird and disgusting practice of clearing used plates and storing them at the back of the dining room seating benches (see picture).Do no waste ur money on this place when there are so many other options in Toronto.
1839;Apart from the view if you were facing the lake, nothing else was good. Food was average, service was so so, décor was bad and price was high.
1840;The shittiest services I've every received. The waiter had an attitude. The waiter took forever with my food. The food had no seasoning. The mail came up to 120 and I honestly did not appreciate it. I think it's time for them to re do there menu or get a different chef that knows what seasoning is. The only thing I enjoyed was my shrimp appetizer. N my wine * white Zinfandel* I could've purchased 2 bottles for the price I paid for 2 glasses. This restaurant is straight up shity and I would not suggest it to anyone. Had to wait 30 mins to get hot water for my tea. But the bread was on fleek thou.  And that water was amazing  never again.
1841;Came here for winterliciousPros: Beautiful scenic view of the harbour from the 38th floor.Cons: Bad service. Bread n butter was served after appetizers and came at same time as main course. WTF?! Food was terrible. Had the shrimp cocktail - shrimp was dry like jerky not fresh tasted like cardboard. The main, AAA beef tenderloin meh..the veggies that came with it was dry as a desert. It was obvious that the food was precook in large batches and just scooped on plates as they are ordered. TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE MONEY!! GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!
1842;Awful.....was there with a group....asked for the minestrone soup....was brought broccoli soup...(yesterdays broccoli) and was told it was cream of mushroom....what were they thinking....many other guests complained of burnt salmon and not only was the food not good, service confused but the prices over the top.....never again......the hotel below (westin) has way better food and should just take over....this place being called an Italian restaurant in Toronto is an insult to anyone who has Italian heritage...not even close.....
1843;Beautiful view but food was less than desirable. I ordered the filet medium rare and it was over cooked. Lobster tail was tiny and not tasty even the mashed potatoes were bland. Go for the view and have a drink but enjoy a meal elsewhere.
1844;I've never walked out of a restaurant before after eating one bite of our entire.  This place was revolting.Went there for Winterlicious with my family. As vegetarians it appeared to have lots of options. My son had the "tofu roll". It was a slab of tofu on some lettuce - nothing "roll" about it. The bread basket of bread came with a crumbled was of gum. After about an hour and a half our mains came - my daughter got the Chef's signature pasta - I've never seen pasta look like dog vomit before. My wife and son got the beet risotto - undercooked, no flavour, just mush. The broccoli pesto pasta that I got was just gross. One bite into it we grabbed our coats, spoke to the manager and walked out. Do not go here.
1845;understaffed, noisy, very disappointedwe went to toula on the first day of winterlicious. it was totally different experience of what i got two years ago. the restaurant was very understaffed. we waited two hours for the main course to come. as a restaurant, you know you are expecting a large group of guests during winterlicious event, but still unprepared? servers were not as professional as expected. rude! gave us an annoying look when we ask for separate bill. furthermore, the lavatory sanitation was poor. at least two of the lavatories in ladies room was wet on the floor, they has been like that at the beginning of my dinner, and still the same at the end of my dinner! how impressing! no one cleaned the wet, messy lavatories for three hours. this is not our first time at toula, but it will definitely be the last!
1846;If I could I would've rated this half a star.  To start, my family and I went to Toula last night for Winterlicious.  My parents love that place and have never had a bad experience until last night.  To be honest it wasn't just one thing that made the evening less enjoyable but a whole series of events..I was the first to arrive with another guest and instead of being seated at our table by the hostess, we had to wait for the hostess and her 2 hostess friends to finish their conversation about how tired they were before being seated at our table.  Once we got comfortable, another guest had arrived.  When she sat down she had told us that she basically had to find our table and seat herself because the hostess, who had told our guest that we had arrived and would bring her to the table, was still busy socializing.Once all our guests arrived, it took the waiter about 45 minutes before even coming over to the table to ask us what we wanted to drink.  By that time we decided to order our mains as well.  The o
1847;What an absolute joke of a night...(Valentines Day).Wanted to have a special night tonight with my girlfriend so I had made reservations for tonight (Feb 14) for a table for 2 at 9pm. We were seated fast, but not by a window seat as I requested and was told there were no window seats available, even though we walked past 2...Next we were greeted by our waitress who gave us each a glass of water. All tables had at least bread on them, but ours did not, so we waited for the waitress to return...It's now 11:00pm and we did not even receive an appetizer...2 hours from being seated ON VALENTINES DAY...then what is even more frustrating is that a couple who came in an hour after we've been waiting, is able to be served at least their appetizers...while its now been almost 2.5 hours for us... so we decided to leave, and noticed other couples around us becoming agitated.Very slow service and very unexpected for a special occasion such as valentines day. The staff is not properly trained to handle large crowds
1848;I could tell when we arrived that this wasn't going to be a good experience. We showed up on time for our reservation to find a several people waiting for tables. The hostess took a while to even acknowledge us, and then told us to join the queue. Shortly after another hostess comes by and yells "which of these people is the next deuce?". None of us deuces knew. That's not our job. The other hostess didn't answer, which prompted her to yell even louder and angrier "who is the next deuce?". In the end, with a reservation we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. And there were plenty of empty seats. I suppose we just have different ideas of what a reservation means.We ordered two of the smallest $12 glasses of wine I've ever seen. 3 oz, maybe 4 oz is too stingy for a place like this. I had the Caprese salad to start, which was delicious and fresh. My date enjoyed her smoked salmon as well. For my main, I had a lobster pasta that included the smallest lobster tail I've ever seen (about 5 cm long, 1.5 cm wide). 
1849;I sold my soul going there. The head chef probably sold his soul working there too. It surely doesn't disappoint to ... disappoint.  I have been here before for summerlicious and my memory was rubber, cardboard and burning tires. This time around is not that different. The meal started with tasteless breadsticks pairs with presumably olive oil and vinegar. Not sure where they sourced the oil looking water but it was bland at best. My appetizer was a smoked salmon. Not only does it look old it taste just like supermarket smoked salmon. I ordered salmon for main. First off we are a table of 13 and a third of us ordered salmon. Every plate looks different with various sized cuts and plating. Mine looks like the server tripped on the way to my table because it is all over the place. The salmon is unsurprisingly over cooked and tasteless. Every bite is trying to suck saliva out of my tongue. The potato is dry and nothing note worthy. The dessert is alright to my surprise. It tastes like almond though I wouldn't ca
1850;No matter the -licious, definitely not Delicious.My family has consistently gone because they've always had a great dining experience and they enjoy the view. The one thing I will give credit for is Toula's extensive menu options for these events. However, I feel that because of all the choices, the quality and presentation of the food was not 100% there. In all the times I've been there (about 3-4), I've only had one good experience there - my first one. Anyways, I had booked a dinner party of 8 for last night with family. I went to this dinner with low expectations since I've already had a negative experience previously - but I wanted to give Toula another chance to change my mind. Dinner was booked at the prime dinner hour of 7PM. Upon arrival, there were several large and small tables empty.Our server came by and gave us all a round of water. About 15 minutes later another waiter took our order. I ordered the Beef Tenderloin for my main. Normally, for any beef the waiter should advise the table how 
1851;DO NOT GO HERE!!!!! If you have  somewhere to be in within 3hrs or less from your reservation time I recommend you do not go here. This is NOT a once in a blue moon situation if you disregard this review you will be sorry. We've done the research and contrary to what some may tell you the extremely long wait times are a regular thing! Also there was people who had experienced even longer wait times. We were actually luck compared to other peopleIf you have no cares in the world and are wiling to wait 2 for a main dish then give it a try. Valentines day dinner planned by my wonderful husband went very bad. Luckily we can talk a lot so we kept ourselves entertained along with the 5 other random couples around us who also were in disbelief on the extreme wait times. Main courses were coming out 2-3 hours after ordering, you'd think they went and caught the fish and came back. Reservation was 8:30pm we were seated within 10mins, which I personally am okay with. Dining area was a bit cooler than I would'v
1852;I went with my boyfriend for their summerlicious menu and we were totally disappointed by their food and their service. Our waiter was unfriendly and didn't try to Talk to us at all. He was hard to find during our dinner and the food was cold when it got to our table. He gave us the bill before we got our dessert and he got our orders mixed up as well. This restaurant needs more waiters and better service. Probably never coming back.
1853;There was only one good thing about this restaurant which was the view of the CN tower and all of Toronto, and unfortunately it doesn't make up for the fact that they were out of so many supplies to make so many things on the menu. When I finally got my simple spaghetti and meatballs, the meat was so dry the spaghetti slowly seeping through my fork that I had to eat it with the spoon and the service was slower.I have no clue how zagat rated that good to excellent, or how some of the average ratings for a "5 star restaurant" was a 4.5, but if there was a way to put less than 1 star, believe me I would.
1854;I went here for summerlicious with 3 other friends so we were able to order most things on the menu. Every plate was just awful. The "handmade tagliatelle pasta" tasted gritty and was not properly made. "Fresh"? I think not. The veal was so overcooked that it tasted like cardboard, and both the salmon and cornish hen were completely dry. I don't know how this restaurant managed to last so long since they couldn't get a single thing on the menu right.The desserts were also disappointing. I sent my "Homemade strawberry and vanilla bavarese" back because there were bits of gelatin that were not fully melted. The waiter told me that it was a "very popular dessert" and that it was just "my personal preference". I was stunned that he tried to argue with me even after I told him that it wasn't made properly. I asked if he could just bring me the "Toula classic homemade vanilla gelato" thinking that a gelato would be hard to screw up. However, it clearly wasn't a gelato but some ice cream that they dug out from the
1855;worst place i have ever been before in my life, if you are thinking of going there don't the food is something that i have never seen before. i have been to many restaurants and this one is by far the worst ever. my dog eats better food then what this place gives out. only good thing from there is my feet where warm by the heater and the nice view of the water front. was not impressed by the valet parking but i can live with that. had soup that was mushroom soup with blended mushrooms with water and salt and boiling hot, shrimp was dead 1 year before i got it made me throw up, stake was (to be med well) was swimming in its own blood, last of all the chocolate cake that was hard as a brick and tasted like shoe leather no taste what so ever, i know as a fact Betty crocker makes a better cake out of a box. my first and last time i ever step foot in this restaurant if i could i would give it -5 stars  very very disappointed
1856;This is the worst bar in the area. I wont ever eat here again after the food was over an hour late with no real excuse. Wings were also cold and seemed under cooked. Sub par at best.
1857;I agree with the last two posts, this place is absolute trash. This bar really ruins the beauty of the danforth, it is an eyesore. The gentlemen outside always have something to say when you walk by and it is very uncomfortable. I decided one day to check it out hoping the alcoholics that are there in the wee hours of the morning will have gone home already. However, I was wrong. Drinks are well overpriced for such a dirty establishment. I suggest you do not go if you're looking for a good time.
1858;I wish I could give less than one star. This is one of the worst bars I've ever been to, actually no it is the worst bar I've ever been to. The waitresses are beyond rude, I arrived to meet friends around 9:30 and walked in and asked for a drink but the waitress would not serve me she just said no. I was very confused and went to sit down with my friends and she would serve all the guys with no problem but I wasn't allowed to be served? I had not been drinking and my appearance was suitable, if anything I was over dressed for such a dingy place. Very bizarre, I left shortly after however when my friend got his bill he was charged different amounts for the exact same drink on the bill. His first pitcher was 25$ the next was 27$ and then 29$ for the exact same drink and size. I have also walked past this bar during the day around 10:30-11 and surprise surprise it's open! And there is always plenty of men smoking outside ready to accost you. In response to a previous poster, I'm not too sure if your race has any
1859;Went to this bar last night and the bartender was so rude she wouldn't serve my friend and I for no reason. She didn't even speak one word to us other then to say "I'm not serving you"! We asked her why and she wouldn't tell us. We weren't inebriated, we were dressed nicely and she was beyond rude and offensive.  I told her I would post this on Yelp as my only explanation is that she was racist. Being a woman of color I felt humiliated and embarrassed. I do NOT recommend this place with this type of treatment to anyone. Stay away and spend your money elsewhere. Hire better staff, some with less attitude
1860;I'm a big fan of the Fit for Life at Bay and Dundas (Atrium on Bay). I decided to try this King and Victoria location on my way to work this morning and was not impressed.Service:- The person making the sandwich was not very efficient and hard to understand. Both the person in front of me and I had to ask her to repeat things several times.- The cashier didn't seem very happy. He rang in my order without telling me the total and told me to just tap my Visa card. The terminal was also turned towards him so the customer could not see the total.- I got no smiles, greetings, thank you, or have a great day. Maybe I'm old fashioned but I remember when I was in customer service roles, I would say all of the above for every transaction.Being Cheap:- I had a free coffee with my meal and tried to substitute for a tea. He tried charging me $1.25 for it. At the Atrium on Bay location you can substitute the coffee for a tea at no charge. I settled for the coffee.The Product:- The veggie deluxe is my favourite. 
1861;While the sandwiches were decent, they were too expensive for what we received. The real problem with this location is the staff. You'll see a repeated theme across reviews for this King Street location.Upon entering, no greeting except a woman coming out from the back on a clearly personal cell phone call. She looked at me as if saying, "what do you want?" I asked her if she was ready for me to order, and she seemed perturbed to have to end her call to help me. I was ordering (4) sandwiches, so there no was way she could continue her conversation and productively help me. But you can see where her priorities were -- clearly not with the customer. At the end, of course no thank you despite my curtesies.I'd avoid this place accordingly.
1862;I went there this morning and bought a carrot muffin, the muffin tasted awful and not fresh at all.
1863;Apparently, I am a slow learner.  Last year I visited this place for lunch and ordered the pad thai with peanut sauce.  Extra peanutty pad thai!  How could this be a bad thing?Picture a pound of rice noodles.  Picture a separate bowl.  Picture yourself emptying a jar of Skippy crunchy peanut butter into this bowl.  Then, add a can of coconut milk.  Then, add four cups of flavourless vegetable oil.  Blend.  Apply to the pound of rice noodles.  Remove flavour.  Serve.Actually, I don't know the recipe, but I dare anyone to contradict me.  It was a mass of rice noodles, sitting despondently in this pale, thick, oozy, oily sauce.  I shuddered, dumped it, and moved on with my life.What happens?  A year passes.  Memory fades.  Surely it was just that one dish?  I have two bites of a friend's amazing red curry (from another establishment), and I have a terrible jones for Thai.  I'm picturing a combo with red curry and pad thai.  How bad could California Thai be?  Even bad Thai is pretty good.  I head up to th
1864;It was very promising after I ordered the Vegetarian Noodles in Tom Yum Soup... They cooked it right in front of me, packed it nicely so I could take it to go, the bowl was also pretty big so the portion was definitely good. But as I unwrapped it and started to dig in, I found a piece of tin looking foil thing in my soup... HELLOOOOO??!!?(uploaded a picture of it too)
1865;Came in for a late lunch, was seated, and ignored for 5 minutes.  Only one server waiting on 4-5 tables.  I rarely lay down a 1star, but here I sit at Swiss Chalet across the parking lot. (I walked out)  I was looking forward to a curry but will have to find somewhere else -- where the employees head is not firmly planted in his a**.   LOL.   Oh well......
1866;One word describes my experience here (ugh). I had driven by this place a few times and gave this place a chance last week. Like sushi, indian food is hit and miss and this place was a miss. I had the 'butter chicken' and it was very dry (I have had butter chicken before and this dish almost tasted like it was made the day before) I had a side order of nam bread with this (which also tasted very stale) This restaurant was definitely understaffed and poorly managed. If you are craving indian food, do not come here!
1867;No No No Don't eat here!!!!I was traveling with family and I wanted Indian food. I was so excited to see this close to the hotel. I ordered Chana Masala the menu say that it included rice. I purchased my food and went back to the hotel. What I received was a "TV dinner" that they didn't even take out of the packaging. NO KIDDING. and no rice was included. The TV dinner only contained the Chana Masala. AND it was gross. This is a real review. They should be ashamed. Really Ashamed. How do I give no stars? 1 star is to much.
1868;PEDOPHILES AND IMMATURE CASHIERS WORK HEREMe and my friend used to always go here and one day the hijabi women with the nose piercing asked my friend for her name and age, then called her pretty which was sweet(I wasnt there). Another time, me and my friend went, the women said hi to my friend, we ordered then sat down in the corner away from sight. She then yelled " ****** your food is ready", which was weird, but i guess since the women knew my friend, she yelled my friends name.I went to pick up both orders, the women saw it was only me and quickly took the drinks off the tray. I put the drinks back on the tray but then she rudely grabbed them off and said bring your friend to grab the drinks, I was weirded out but i thought since my friend also wore a hijab and was pretty, the women thought she might be a good match for her son thats probably why she likes my friend so much (my friends thought that too). I went and told my friend and she was so uncomfortable. Today we went again with another friend and 
1869;This place would have gotten a negative 0000 if that was an option. The food is terrible. It comes with extra fat. The back workers will put the fatty ones in your order (sandwich) if they don't like you.  Cashier and this lady in the scarf that works there, the older lady is  totally incompetent. Karma will come back around to her really quick. She said something in her language about me. Which, I understood because I'm from a place where they watch bollywood movies all day and I understand more than enough words in urdu. She said, "everytime this girl comes in she's angry." Still until this day she looks at me like I'm the idiot when I go in. But like a said Karma is just around the corner for her. Customer service is extremely terrible. Workers are extremely racist. This will be the Last time I will ever even think to go back. Ugh!!
1870;We had their chicken sandwich last Wednesday and boy it was just crap. I think there are better options to waste money.I wouldn't go there again.
1871;I order 3 pcs and ask for white meat and there is an up charge. I then order the Tuesday special which is $2  something and they says its red meat. I ask if they can up chatge they say no. So I ask the combo 2 of 2!pc $7.99 regular and ask for white meat and they say  there is an up charge. So whats the diff on tuesday special of 2 pcs and the combo $7.99 2 pcs ? In some Popoyes they dont upcharge me if I ask for white meat.
1872;I am absolutely appalled at how incompetent this location is. First & foremost (to whom this may concern) there is an ongoing confusion as too what things on the menu are Halal, & are not Halal. Aside from that, this location has the absolute worst customer service, & staff, I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. When you physically enter the location there is staff that runs around behind the counter with ZERO service training. They don't LISTEN to what you're ordering, and almost always get your order wrong. Kind of goes something like:Customer: "Can I get one spicy chicken sandwich combo?"Staff: "one small mashed potatoes, sure" To top it off ordering for delivery is a painstaking process. For example, I've ordered delivery, gotten it delivered 1 1/2hrs later.. the order was wrong. When I called to have this fixed, the girl on the phone said. "Well what we sent you was actually more expensive so you can keep that".. when I refused and said no deliver what I ordered please. She gave me at
1873;I come here only they use the Halal meet here, but service is very slow always waiting for a while. If there is any other Halal Popeyes, I never come here again. I even don't want to one start to them.
1874;This is the worst location I've been to. Everything takes 30 minutes to make and the staff are always extremely confused. The complete opposite of fast food.
1875;I came in to purchase an 8-piece family meal and the person at the cash register said they did not have any chicken. I found it ridiculous that I could walk into a Popeyes mid-day & be told such foolish information. She even stated that it would take too long to make the chicken I requested, forcing me to go elsewhere to eat. Poor customer service.
1876;1 star is actually very generous! I am sooo disappointed! First I ordered the perogies with bacon and onions and sour cream...  they were awful! deep fried in what tasted like old oil..  and as for the so called bacon? it was those imitation bacon bits that are hard and crunchy!  and onions were almost raw... I also ordered a julienne salad  which was supposed to have tomatoes... salami... ham and cheese or rather so called cheese! it was processed sliced cheese. like are you kidding me? and last I ordered 2 subs which apparently were excellent... I used to love ordering from there but Never again!
1877;I ordered 90 bucks worth of food witch involved a party size pizza when the order came the most important thing was missing the PIZZA! As the driver Apologized he went back to get my pizza and I I talked to the manager he was very rude and very vulgar they told me that it would be five minutes it was really 20 minutes by the time it came they wouldn't take the pizza off for me and they wouldn't do me a deal so I paid the whole 90 bucks Service was terrible I do not recommend this to nobody you're better off ordering from pizza pizza!!!
1878;should have read there reviews about customer service ordered delivery they said about 45 min alomost 2 hrs late still no pizza had to call to cancel sorry folks don't want fresh delivey! utter Dissapointment!
1879;I ordered from their Main Street location and would certainly not recommend it simply for their "Customer Service."  This place is relatively close to me in location and so felt it would be convenient, though BEWARE, if your order is wrong, YOU are the liar.  Last Summer I ordered two panzerotto's, and the ingredients in one of them contained tons of hot peppers, and I cannot eat spicy. They told me I was lying and hung up on me!  Waste of money and no dinner for me. One year later, I decided to try again.  I asked to add ingredients to a poutine, which friends of mine always does that lives in my building, and even though I was very polite the angry woman told me that they do not do this and when I told her I would pay extra she yelled and told me they do not do this (you make pizza, how difficult is this to throw some mushrooms on top, especially knowing they've done this for friends of mine). I had to hang up on her since she was losing it, and I ordered from somewhere else.  Food is your regular cheap and
1880;Ordered through Just eat. Driver came to our building and refused to bring the food to our door. Says there was no safe place to park his car. See photo of his car, parked safely. Store called and asked us to go down and get it as the driver did not want to leave his car for fear of towing. We live in a building with aprox 70 units, deliveries happen all the time, you would have to leave your car in the spot for 24 hours before anything would be done. The amount of time he sat in his car was triple what it would have taken to get out and bring it to our door.Manager at Diamonds was rude on the phone and hung up on us.Did not get to try the food.
1881;guilty pleasure: indulging in delivery, and this place definitely had a lot of options that suited every mood. but they have the WORST costumer service. I let it pass the first time, even the second time i said 'probably a bad day', but the third time is just too much. The first time i ordered from there I had missed the delivery guys first call and caught the second call of which was the 'call center/office', and the woman said 'My driver is at your door and trying to call you, do you want the food?'..trust me, it wasn't a nice tone. i understand how annoying it can be when customers don't answer so i actually felt bad. any way we went downstairs and let him in and he was wailing in a loud tone saying he was going to die in the cold, and if he did it would be my fault. he said "why do i always get these calls?", while he was moaning and complaining i had paid on the machine and tipped him $8 - once he saw that he instantly flipped and started smiling and apologizing. Still though, it was un-real. The s
1882;The staff working here are not customer-friendly. It doesn't matter if it's White or Asian, everytime i come here, they act so rude. They are not smiling, they take your order even if you're still far (that means they raise their voice and couldn't wait for you to move up. The food taste good but the customer service is worst! I'd rather go to Big Smoke Burger.
1883;I don't know what the hype is about, I swear Costco poutine beats their poutine. The fries themselves are burnt and have a weird taste to them. Their hotdogs are bland AF. What a waste.
1884;I was at new york fries sq1 food court 2day, I ordered large fries it was burnt & smelt funky! Def the 1st & the last never ever again. As for customer service the worst, kids r runnin the show. Rude, ignorant, staff def needs to be retrained how to serve customers. They absolutely don't know how to serve fries, ain't rocket science. Everytime I order large fries the cup is filled halfway. When i tap the cup against the counter in front of the staff to show them, then i ask to add more fries it's done. Really annoying, the hot dogs r ok, fountain drinks only 1 refill. The poutines aren't that great either, expensive, taste bad. I had better at costco & harveys, at other locations no issues with the fries. Highly not recommend.
1885;This location has extremely slow service, the fries are always over salted, coffees are made inconsistently, and you are guaranteed to receive at least one item in your order wrong!
1886;This has to be the worst McDonald's in all of Canada. Very very slow unorganized they make all kinds of mistakes and very rude
1887;20 minute wait in line for them to say "no, we dont have ice cream". I mentioned a sign posted would be nice - no comment, no apology.
1888;There is exactly 1 improvement on McD menu: red onions choice. But they still serve their sandwiches without melting the cheese & it's lukewarm. At least the fries were hot. Mushrooms have no flavour, they are put on cheese separately instead of melting them with cheese. No wonder everything is bland and tasteless unless you salt & pepper it. I asked for a crispy chicken Swiss Mushroom melt with only red onions & pickles. I loathe ketchup mayonnaise & relish & given I have diabetes I shouldn't have the sugar anyway. The server gives me my order with no cheese & mushroom & then claims I said ONLY red onions & pickles. Then why would I ask for a Swiss Mushroom Melt? Duh! So they remade it. And put on mushrooms separately & didn't melt the Swiss cheese at all. One star is generous.
1889;Nasty super salty over and under cooked food.. they don't care they just want to collect your money and serve someone else.. would give it a ZERO review if I could.. this place should be shut down
1890;Im sick and tired of owners giving there last dollar to make a buisness thrive and unappreciative employees get paid. I dont want any financial compensation or free food.  All i want to know is after i was handed my take out order. Were you found such a talented employee that can close the take out window and tell me "FUCK OFF NOW, YOU PIECE OF WHITE FUCKIN TRASH!!" and slide the window closed at the same time.   I really mean it.   That takes wisdom, practice , and skill to do something like that!!  When the question is answered. You will get a 5 star!!  Sincerly  .... White trash here!!
1891;This place sucks the bag worst mc d I've ever been to.service?!&@" food  cleanliness  nobody gives a shit about their job at this place.management no where to be seen?
1892;This is by far the worst McDonald's in the GTA. Expect a long wait for a messed up order.
1893;This has to be one of the slowest McDonald's I've been to, the parking lot is terrible and they're slow as hell. Been waiting for my breakfast for 15 mins now. Terrible management.
1894;Saw the reviews, thought maybe it was an exaggeration.. after all, how bad could it be? Well today, I witnessed the worse McDonald's in my life. First off, the parking lot and the design of the drive thru is horrendous. Simply terrible.. not enough parking and the way the drive thru cuts through the path to MCD is really strange. Also it is a one way design so that adds to the confusion. I came during breakfast and ordered a standard egg McMuffin combo... Definitely did not expect a wait over 25 minutes and the order to come out messed up. If I wanted that sort of wait, I could've gone to a Coras. No idea how that could occur since I've seen busier MCD bust out orders within 5 minutes. I hate to blame the employees but whoever is managing this store is doing a terrible job.
1895;Went there the other day and waited 15 minutes for my Big Mac. The managers have no control what so ever as the employees were all screaming and swearing that they didn't want to be there.NEVER again
1896;Love shoeless in Oshawa and love shoeless in Ajax. Have now tried this location in Whitby 3 times and all 3 times it was awful. We live in Whitby but will either go to Oshawa or Ajax then go here.Not once have they got our order right and the none of the waitresses ever came around to ask us how our food was or even to take refills. We had to flag the manager for our bill on one occasion. I'm not sure if it's a training issue because we don't think we have had the same waitress all 3 times. Avoid and just go to Oshawa or Ajax.
1897;Had a small party for 10 at the Salem and Kingston SLJ.  Food was dry, over cooked and took a long time for the food to come out. A bit pricey, Was not impress with overall meal and  atmosphere. Second time there and never again will we go back.
1898;Food was horrible.  Chicken wings were bone dry.  Portions are small and way way wayyy to expensive.  Don't go!
1899;I believe our waitress was new or had just started but service was super slow and we didn't get checked in on once.
1900;Went in at 10pm tonight (Sunday) for wings. Wasn't busy at all. Got sat, drinks then waited 15 mins or longer for someone to take our fucking order just to be told THERE'S NO WINGS. I get not everyone will have the thing you happen to be out of. But the manager sat us down, at least let me fucking know? Most people would have said don't worry about the drink. But kinda pissed that I had to  pay for a fucking $3 drink after waiting for fucking ever. I've served before so I understand but UNACCEPTABLE. Also been told by servers themselves that food goes back often for being undercooked.
1901;This is the last time I'll be ordering from this particular location. The first couple times I ordered from there, the food tasted great. However, the last couple of times I've ordered, not only did the pizza taste off but I was running to the bathroom all night and also feeling like I was going to barf. Last night was the last straw, as today I still have bad diarrhea and feel nauseous. Either the oil has gone rancid or someone isn't washing their hands properly before preparing the food. Nevertheless, please be aware if you order from or go to this location and look out for your own health.
1902;This is my second bad experience here. I vowed never to return.  Should have stuck to it.Recently revisited this location.My order (by phone): large pepperoni, single dipping sauce.My request upon arriving: the special, 2 dipping sauces, 2 cans of pop.The staff of 3 men refused to remove the first dipping sauce at full price, and insisted I take 3 dipping sauces and 2 cans of pop.After pretending not to understand my request and holding up the line, they passed me a phone, to pizza nova head office.  The woman on the line told me my request was no problem.I personally felt the need to apologize to the patrons behind me in line for holding them up over a $0.75 item.How embarrassing.I will never return.  There's a great dominos across the street.
1903;This location received a yellow dine safe rating on December 29 2015The yellow was for improper sanitation of food preparation surfaces and or utensils. AndFailure to provide and ensure proper employee hand washing
1904;Jus got salad from here they chanced the dressing n over cooked the chicken I'd rather go to queen street their salads on point
1905;Wish I could give zero stars. Pizza was late and cold. No discount. And when I called to ask where the pizza was I was hung up on 3 times.  And mobile ad sucks.  Pizza pizza is cheaper and has better customer service. I just wanted to try stuffed crust :(
1906;So freaking slow. Food is fine but waiting on a pizza for close to an hour now and they just called to say maybe another hour and a half. I can't imagine what will show up at our door or when. I get sucked in by the specials but I should know better.
1907;Avoid this place like it was the plague.  The pizza from this location is always undercooked, and this past weekend we had a ball of hair on our Veggie Pizza.  It wasn't just one random hair, which would still be be gross, it was if someone had emptied an electric shaver on one of the slices.Due to previous poor quality we didn't even bother to call it in, just threw it all out and ordered a new pizza from a local place.
1908;If you like your pizza late everytime this is the location to order from.  Minimum 10 minutes late.  I've had times where they were over an hour late.  Each time you call it's the same "oh the driver left already and should be there soon."  Heard that excuse 3 times when they were over an hour late.  If it's bad weather then sure, I understand.  It's like they don't care if it's late cause you still have to pay.
1909;Okay. Do not order katsu chicken. Wasted $11 on this. Chicken taste bad and it's soooo small. Look at the amount of bean sprout they give you. Not worth $11 never coming back
1910;Overpriced and bad quality. If you want korean/japanese food just bus down to yonge and finch, any restaurant down the street there is better and still cheaper (bus fares included) than this place.
1911;I used to go to York and spent most of my meal plan for my first few year here . Then I stopped going. I found their food taste acceptable - def not great. I even remember the dish I saw on most students' table back then - gamjatang. The service was usually quite decent actually. What really turned me off was the hygiene and sanitation. My roommate who was working there back then advised me not to go there as the kitchen was really dirty. I did not take it seriously till one day, the student sitting next to me saw a dead fruit fly in his rice. He went up to the counter and the owner came up. They offered him a new dish. I think he should have asked to get his money back instead but he let it go. I never went back myself since.
1912;This place is absolutely horrible and disgusting.First off the food is not cheap, many authentic korean and japanese restaurants are cheaper and have better quality food.The food is gross, the rice is dry and the salad is limp. Yes they got the katsu right, but that was the only thing eaten on my plate. The bed of bean sprouts it lays on top of is just sad. They also put some sauce on the rice which sits in a bowl on the counter with a gigantic brush to drip onto the rice. I wonder how old and how long the sauce has been sitting there out in the open.The cashier/server turned me off from the food the most. Constantly scratching his arms and head and then proceeding to handle the rice, sauce and vinegar...  I used to work in food services and this is a definite no-no. Wash your hands man.Never coming here again unless I want a san pelligrino, and that is definitely all I'm getting.
1913;Wow, I just had the most disgusting food there. It's really not worth anything. Can't find words. Just stay away, even if you are starving!! YUCK.I just lost $13.
1914;Absolutely the worst.Ordered a chicken cutlet and bulgogi to go, the lady keep saying pork, and after I reminded her twice, unbelievable, I still got the pork!Bulgogi is just too sweet and rice is overall very dry. Cutlet is thin and also dry.
1915;Service is ok. Problem is my toast had mold on it. They made me a new plate eggs bacon toast etc right away even though I said im ok. I didn't touch the 2nd plate and still got charged full price. Long story short this location is not that good.
1916;This is by far the worst breakfast place I have ever been to. I ordered a vegetarian omelette with extra fruit instead of potatoes. I get eggs bacon and potatoes and NO FRUIT. I'm a vegetarian and the girl on the phone tried insisting there was no bacon in my meal. Disgusting customer service very rude rushed me off the phone while taking my order that's probably why nothing I asked for was right. I ended up ordering the same breakfast at the woodbine location and they were great it's less then ten minutes apart don't waste your time at this place go to their other location at 7333 woodbine Ave.
1917;Called to order a large pizza.  Called back 5 minutes later to order dipping sauce.  Our sauce did not come with our order.  The order was $16 and the driver did not have change for our $20 bill.  After complaining went to his car and brought back $1.50.  I did not know I as required to tip my Domino's driver who didn't even bring our full order and expected a $4 tip,  Will not be ordering from Domino's again.  I called the driver back and he hung up on me.  Incredibly poor service.
1918;Terrible. The store is not far from our house. The pizza showed up fairly quickly, so why was it barely warm when it showed up? I think because it was made hours earlier and reheated. I've ordered from Domino's before from other locations, and it was really good. I'll never order it when I'm at home again because I know it'll come from this store. Head office should pull the plug on this store.
1919;Had a disappointing experience here. Ordered some takeout for dinner on Friday. After a long drawn out very confusing conversation with the operator we placed our order. We told them specifically we lived north of Bloor. They took our address and postal code.  They called us back 20 minutes later to say they could not deliver north of Bloor, leaving us hungry and unimpressed. We will not be ordering from here again.
1920;We ordered this Monday night after a busy work day. Generally a fail safe, as you know what you're going to get. Not this time. I got my own pan pizza, which saved my boyfriend who got his own pizza, from being violently ill for 3 days. Im still feeling the stomach pain, although not the terrible twisting of death i was the days before. I phoned to inform them of what happened and of course, just as i thought, the person i spoke too did not care or say anything worth anything. I explained how I didn't want anything, just that they should probably know. They proceeded to tell me that i would need to see a doctor to prove what happened. I honestly do not care nearly enough to pay $10 for a doctors note to prove this. I am just warning other people that this was by far the most painful sick i have ever been in my life. Violently awful and lasted for days now. Please beware...
1921;I would like to tell you how I liked the food here, but sadly cannot.I went in for lunch today craving some jerk pork. When I got here I had to wait for several minutes for someone to come out of the back to take my order. When she did finally drag herself out of the back, since it's so much work to look after a customer and all, she informed me that they do not have jerk pork and pointed to the menu board. Rather than give me suggestions on what else I might enjoy, she proceeded to take a personal call on her cell. She was on the call for a while laughing and sucking her teeth. Since she had no interest in what I might want to order instead, I left.
1922;The customer service was very poor and so was the food. I ordered Curry Chicken and it was extremely dry as if it was prepared 2 days ago. The freshest thing was the veggies. I will never buy their food again!!!
1923;So gross. Its always littered with loud mouthed teenagers, service is rude and slow and Ive found hair in my food more than once.
1924;I ordered a Big Mac combo and a cheese burger. They gave me a soggy wrap. Maybe it's because I went through the drive through after midnight. If you do go be sure to check your order. This place is notorious for their order screw ups.
1925;I don't normally review fast food chains, but I must voice my concern. Is McDonalds modifying the menu?  Going exotic perhaps? I got drive thru breakfast this morning and brought it home for my wife and I.  In the mist of her biting into her hashbrown a small speck fell off.  Upon closer examination it was an ant or a wasp that was deep fried!  Oh McDonalds, I thought your quality control and restaurant cleanliness was top priority.
1926;Not that McDonalds is ever a good place to eat, but this location is consistently terrible. It just so happens to be close to my home so if I'm on my way home and need something quick, I will stop at the drive through and every time, I wonder why I bothered. Slowest service ever, like even in the middle of the night it takes 20 min to get through. The teens taking your order are full of attitide, say "uh huh", "what else" and have no manners. When you get to the window there is typically one person actually working and 5 others goofing around and being loud and obnoxious. I mean. Not that I ever expect much from a fast food place, let alone a McDonalds, this place takes the cake for exceptionally poor service. Perhaps hire a manager who is out of highschool?
1927;I'm writing this review while I'm sitting in the drive thru for half an hour for a beef burrito.
1928;worst taco bell ever, this one has ruined taco bell canada for me
1929;If you're going to serve ramen, then you better make the noodles right!!!I didn't mind that the proteins were blend or that the stock was lacking, but if the noodles are bad, then the whole bowl falls apart. There "real fruit juices" are more sugar and favouring. They might as well serve me instant ramen with kool aid.
1930;Save yourself the $9 and go somewhere else! I ordered a chicken avocado wrap. They didn't cut the wrap, it will packed full of romaine and green peppers (very bitter) with no avocado and minimal chicken. I took two bites and threw it out.My co workers avoid this place like the plague.
1931;I went to this Wild Wings locations with my cousin one night to watch the UFC fights.I normally would not go to a chain restaurant but I went to accompany my cousin, we ordered some food then some dessert. I tried to order coffee but it turns out that Wild Wings does not serve any coffee, the staff gave me all kinds for BS excuses as to why they do not sell coffee!I was a little shocked at the fact they don't serve coffee! Needless to say it is things like that why I don't go to chain type restaurants.#30daysofYelp
1932;First of all the waitress had no idea about the menu, doors too 25 mins.  We got an appetizer which showed up at the same time as the food 25 mins later, then was incomplete.  Salad missing, no salsa for the nachos and wings were over done.  I would have been embarrassed to serve this in my own restaurant.  The waitress put ice in my son's chocolate milk and we had to wait another 25 mins for them to clear the dirty plates and bring a bill.  I will never return.
1933;Terrible service .... Terrible over cooked wings. Literally was like eating dried out oil jerky ... Not sure how they are still in business. Tip* save your time and money go somewhere else... Anywhere else will be better.
1934;VERY BAD SERVICEMe and my girlfriend went to this place about more a year ago.  We ordered a small pitcher of beer, but the waitress placed a wrong with a large pitcher, however we didn't realized until we drank one third of it.  So we asked the waitress if she took the wrong order, she said sorry to us that she though we want a large pitcher.  Anyhow no way for me and my gf finish it.  So, I told her that I don't pay the price of the large pitcher.  Make it short, she talk to her manager and the manager said cannot adjust the bill and said that we already drank one third of if. I was pissed and told the waitress that I am not going to pay it.  End up the manager took our beer away and didn't say anything.  Then the waitress came to us and said that the bill already adjusted.  But our beer was gonna and we didn't even finish the amount of a small pitcher of beer.  It was their fault and they took the rest of beer away.  What kind of service is this?  They don't know how to run a service business in Canada.  
1935;Ya, no.Horrible experience.  Wings were tiny, like if Derek Zoolander were there he'd have questions.Sauce was decent, but they rated it 4 out of 5 for heat... I'd have rated it a 2 max.Only one server who was doubling as bartender.  Slooooooowwww service.  I'll give her a break because she was alone, but come on.  The place was not that busy and apparently had lots of time to talk to fanclub/boyfriend at the bar.There are much better options, won't be back.
1936;Never again.. I think this was by far the worst Wild Wing I've been to. The service, food and restaurant itself was so bad.Our waitress was so clueless the entire time we were there. Whenever we asked her for something, she'd forget, then we would have to remind her. She would literally come back like 15-20 minutes later. When I said the restaurant was bad itself, the tables were SO sticky and an alarm went on for the last 30 minutes we were there, kept going on and off. We left because we couldn't stand it.I got spicy gar-par boneless wings w/ regular fries, which also came with carrots. The boneless wings were OKAY, not the best. The fries were so soggy and gross. I hated the food.Def. will not be back.
1937;Extremely poor customer service. Waited 30 mins to be served just water, and mind you that the restaurant was empty. When food finally arrived 1 hour after being seated, the food felt as if it was a little warmer than room temperature. Highly recommend you to go to another location.
1938;This place is a scam. There is a deal on Wednesday which is 59 cents wings minimum order is 9wings. However, they made up a rule that 2 people 2 drinks are mandatory which is bullcrap! and the customer service is really bad. the waitress gave us our wings and left us there with no fork and plate. how the hell do you expect us to eat wings with no fork and plate? It took her at least 5 minutes to see us waiving our hands and there is very little customers in the restaurant. WILL NEVER GO AGAIN!!!
1939;More like BOTTOM Sushi. The only good thing about this place is their tempura, but that isn't enough to make me come back. 1. The water tasted dusty. 2. The salad is gross. What is that, mayonnaise?3. The sushi rice was hard and dry. 4. The chicken teriyaki was too sweet, in a sickening way.5. Their fried tofu dish had huge fish flakes on it, which I have never seen in any agedashi tofu dish. Very unappetizing. I can't give it a zero, since 1 is the lowest I am able to do. Do not recommend.
1940;I came here with a group for a friend's birthday and I think we all agreed that our experience wasn't even decent at best. We went to the upstairs dining area because we came in a large party, but we came to find that it was a bit of a shabby environment. There were random birthday decorations strewn about along the walls, which we thought was because we came for a birthday gathering. However, that wasn't the case because you could clearly see that the balloons were droopy and deflated and the decor faded as if they put these things up ages ago and just never bothered to take them down.As for the food, there were only a few things that were memorable, but for all the wrong reasons. One of our main complaints was that the seaweed salad because it was anything but that. One of the people in our group was vegan so when she received a salad with lettuce drenched in some kind of creamy dressing (assuming to be thousand island) with a sprinkling of dried seaweed on top, she was incredibly displeased. My friends a
1941;No... not top sushi. You get what you pay for. I had the calamari, which was cooked to ruin, and the unagi roll, which was slathered in bbq sauce. The server was rude and inattentive and kept shouting to the kitchen.
1942;Went for lunch today and had the all you can eat special. Not only was the food subpar, but they didn't even bring all of it.Never stepping foot here again!
1943;Doesn't matter of the prices or qualities. The mere fact j got sick from eating it should prevent me going there any more. Anyone else?
1944;Everything about this place is depressing.Staff look like they're being held hostage and sweating profusely. Don't speak English.Interior looks like someone was creating a movie scene and asked, "Can you mix a truck stop restaurant with a Toronto sushi join?"Avocados were harder than my dick. Sushi was poor quality.Music was a 50/50 mix of obnoxious top 40 and radio advertisements.Businesses like this should not be in business, but somehow they are. Probably due to a good location: near U of T.
1945;Been here twice, tried tge chiraso the first time and it was okay..very small cuts and of poor quality, prices are only a buck less than a regular restaurant.  Radio is too loud for the size of the place.  Second visit, same issue cant hear anything over the top 40 station blasting (ke$ha isn't really early afternoon brunch music) the Worst was the red dragon roll-soo skimpy and too much rice, the salmon is actually cut into small squares the size of a thimble lol. Thats not good, I understand cost controls on foods but this is just driving away customers :s
1946;Horrible overpriced sushi. Avoid at all cost if you can. If you cant avoid it, at least dont order the bubble tea
1947;What can I say? Don't go to Top Sushi. I've never been a fan of small, casual sushi restaurants around the block because I'd rather not eat sushi that's made sloppily. There's a standard to sushi, and that's fresh raw fish without a brick of rice under it.Alas, I succumbed to ordering takeout from Top Sushi because I was nearby and I wanted sushi. I regret it. I ordered the Salmon Sushi Set for takeout and to be fair, the sushi was decent. It didn't look horrendous and tasted alright. Howeverrrrrrrr, when I got home that night, I suffered a bad case of food poisoning. And now I remember why I pay more for good sushi.Lesson of the day kids pay more for good sushi.
1948;Been here for lunch on a Thursday, everything tasted so bland, and too much rice for the maki.The salad dressing tasted bad, and  the worse was that I found a piece of tinsel in my salad.  For the dynamite rolls, other restaurants they made them spicy, this restaurant I have to add $1.00 to make it spicy.  If I order a spicy mayo aside it is only 50 cent.  What a rip off.  They copy New Generation's menu, NG's lunch special cost $5.99, they charge $6.99 ($7.90 after tax).  I can have much better meals at that price.
1949;My first visit to this place and within 5 hours I had the worst bout of food poisoning I've had in my life.  3 days of stomach pain, diarrhea, sweats (both hot and cold), general malaise, body aches, and tiredness.1- Phone ordering was easy, especially since we called 15 minutes before closing2- Customer service was ok, we paid and waited for them to get the order finished when we arrived.  They chatted amongst themselves but handed the food over with a smile3- Portion size was good4- The food seemed ok while I was eating it.  Not overly impressed with the taste but not the worst sushi I've tasted.Sadly this experience has put a long-term halt to my sushi intake...and I've loved sushi for years.  The thought of reliving the pain just isn't worth it to me no matter the place serving the sushi.  They've scarred me that much.The silver lining, my wife ate exactly the same thing and didn't get sick.  I'm glad she didn't have to live through what I did.  Interesting to note it was her 2nd time eating t
1950;The only reason why I go to this place is because in between classes I have limited time for lunch. They are usually packed during lunch hour but this is probably because of the same reason I go ( no time) . I absolutely hate their service, they(the waitress) are really rude, balance that with the chef being nice. But anyway, their sushi is avg half the time and the other half of the time you end up with really nasty soggy rice. Yuck. But despite the soggy rice I don't say anything :( because I'm afraid when I go back next time they will poison me!
1951;McDonald's without wifi.  What year is this?  Total fail.Second, this location needs to improve the way it organizes its line ups too.  When busy, people are confused and jumping the line.  Chaos and anger galore.
1952;THIS LOCATION IS CRAP! Last summer (which was the last time I was there), I ordered a large coke. The people behind me ordering full meals, got their food before I got my measley coke. When u ask the employess about it, they give u dirty looks or pretend not to understand u. The employees and managers are always chatting loudly and acting like they are not at a place of work. I will never go to this location again. Next time I want to eat McDicks, I will walk to another location. If you come to this location to get food, guranteed you will leave angry. Avoid this place. FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL
1953;Everytime I go to this spot for ice cream, I wait in line for a while with ice cream options flashing on the large digital menu. Finally get to the counter and hear, "the ice cream machine is not working". Really? Come on, it's summer and you continuously fail to provide a basic item on your menu. Get it together. Safe to say I shall never visit this location. Avoid if you want ice cream, this spot will disappoint you
1954;Just witnessed a manager openly belittle a staff member while I was waiting for my food. Totally inapropriate to do in front of customers.Restaurant was clean, staff friendly.Manager needs retraining.
1955;One of the worst Wendy's I've visited.  Devote is very dated - the duct tape on the seats didn't help either.  The food did not taste fresh (multiple visits too).  The staff were very unfriendly and seemed bothered just to do their job.  Also being told that the limit on hot sauce was "one packet per customer", flabbergasted me.  After 3 disappointing visits will not return to this location.
1956;Nice atmosphere but new workers and poor management. The food is garbage. I got a beer here and they didn't even poor it properly, 1/4 of the glass had foam. Management sucks and not enough people to serve customers.
1957;I've been to a few restaurants in my day and this one really takes the cake. I'd give it 0 stars if possible. We came in on a Monday night and ordered some beers and wings. Didn't think this would be too hard of an order but alas we were mistaken. Half of the wings came after 45 minutes and were cold. The other half came 15 minutes later and were rock hard, inedible. We asked to speak to a manager since we really just wanted our thoughts to be heard. Another 15 minutes later another server came over saying they're kind of the manager?? He said the food was not cold and it was not slow and there's nothing he can do. Appalled, we asked him to call the owner who is clearly the root of the terrible service this location seems to be known for. He offered us a dessert. We said we would pay half the bill. Eventually he gave in. We work five minutes away and will never return.
1958;Went in on a Thursday night and it was completely empty. One table.Server said we could sit at a booth and did just that. Then the server came back and said because of the raptors playoff game, booths were reserved for 4 or more people and told us we can sit at the bar.Didn't realize empty restaurants with no customers can pick and choose their business based on anticipated crowds. Too bad. We would have spent quite a bit on beers and food since we are huge raptors fans.I write this as I sit at a booth at the wild wing on markham road. Won't be coming back to the Angus Glen location ever.
1959;Bad service, bad wings. Save yourself the money and drive 5 mins east to the Markham/bur oak one, at least that one won't give you diarrhea!
1960;This was the worst wings experience of my life. I was not served for over 20 minutes, was then asked multiple times whether I wanted breaded or unbreaded wings (I chose unbreaded btw). Wings took over 30 minutes to come, only to be cold and breaded. The fries were stale, so much that my fork couldn't even pierce it. And when I asked about the error in my order, the server simply said he can redo it but I'll have to wait for everything to be completed before they can make mines. I accepted whatever I had as is because I was not down to wait another hour for 8 cold wings. I was not satisfied, the flavour was disgusting and I had to grab food elsewhere after.
1961;During the boxing day madness, my friend suggested to just walk up to this McDonalds, since we were guarantee it wouldn't be crowded. And that was the case. The lineup was very reasonable, yet the service was so slow. I also had a very small order, but it still took 15 minutes for them to get my order. The snack wrap was cold and they put too much sugar and cream in my coffee when I asked for a regular coffee.Not the best McDonalds. Never planning to come by again. There's other fast food chains around to have.
1962;Rude, 20 minutes time limit, security kicks you out without letting you finish your meal, even with 70% seats empty. Stay away if you want a peaceful meal.
1963;New order-pickup system is horrible. Results in extremely long wait times to get your food. Very disappointed here
1964;Gawd awful service.  This is not a food critique.  It's McDonalds.  It is what is is.But what it is about is the WORST service ever at a McD's.  Across all shifts and all different employees.  IDK if its shitty due to lack of staff or if they can't keep staff cause its shitty to work there.  Either way it shouldn't take 7 minutes for a large Ice Tea.  Serious. 7 minutes.  Or the time I ordered 2 double hamburgers, waited almost 10mins, got only single patties.  Watched her throw them in garbage when all I needed was a patty taken out of the plastic tray that keeps it warm and put on the damn things.  Wasteful. And another 8mins.  And a snotty and dismissive attitude when the MANAGER gives me my order eith no apology for mix up or wait.  I hate that this place is across the street from me and is 24hours.  lousy customer experience and a lot of homeless hanging around as well.  And the washrooms are usually dirty. So yay.
1965;Jeffrey used to be the manager (thank God his useless self doesn't work there anymore) and he used to check out the younger kids. Mind you, he's a lottt older. I've also heard his racist comments about black people when I'd order food from time to time. It's pathetic that the owners would keep him around.And there's this woman named Julie who was super rude and acted like she owned the store, but no honey. You make $11/hr. Humble yourself. She gave me attitude and refused to give me a new drink when she gave me a wet cup. Can we say lazy?This place has a reputation to keep disrespectful employees for as long as they can.
1966;The worst service. Such a long wait for anything! Even coffee! Dirty inside and the wheelchair accessible doesnt seem to be ever working. Unpleasant staff that cannot handle requests like no mustard on a hamburger. Seemed to annoyed by everything. Disappointed every time I make the mistake of go there.
1967;I live really close to this place, and for one of the busiest McDonald's I have ever been to, I can't believe how understaffed the place is.Don't even think of going in here on a weekend after midnight... you will end up waiting 15 minutes to order and another 15 minutes to receive your order.I realize it is one of the few that are open 24/7 in the downtown core, but this place is a disgrace.  I would rather drive to another location that is open late than walk here and wait for cold food.  The one good thing is that it keeps me from eating the pseudo food, that is serverd at McDonald's!
1968;I was stalked and harassed, attacked and thrown down because I have a service dog.  I was told by the manager it was ok to do this to me.  I was not asked if my dog was a service dog and I had put the tags on her.  I was also told I could never come back because I stood up for myself for having a service dog.  Many videos were taken of this incident.  The manager did not even know the laws for service dogs. She told me I had to provide proof which is not required as it is a medical device and we do not have to, however, I had proof and was mistreated and the manager said it was totally acceptable and I did not belong there.
1969;Found the bakery items very overpriced and there wasn't a large selection of breads or cake whatsoever.  One of the ladies behind the counter was extremely rude and impatient, we're definitely not coming back here again.  Even though they offer beef balls, it wasn't that good.  Interior was kind of dirty, but expected because it matches the outside
1970;We ordered a cake and told them we will pick up today.Today we went to pick up and they told us it was SOLD.It is the worst location. You need to pay for parking and bad bakery
1971;Let me start by saying that this location HAS to be the worst Mcdonalds in the gta.I have been here countless times and the service is always deplorable.Whether it's the teenagers laughing over the speaker when trying to place an order going through the drive thru, or placing an order in drive thru and getting a answer of 'what' after placing it like they weren't paying attention in the first place.But this morning takes the cake.After a late night out I had a craving for a Big Mac (this location is a 2 min drive from my house) I arrive in the drive thru at exactly 330am, now they have signage posted around the exterior that they start serving breakfast at 4am I'm like perfect I can still get a Big Mac combo, as I'm about to place my order in the drive thru I'm greeted by a employee who says ' we are currently closed as we have to switch over to our breakfast menu, goodnight' I'm like WTF !!! This is a 24 hr location how the hell do you close !??? And why does it take 1/2 to switch to breakfast mode ????
1972;I have had countless bad experiences at this location.   So much so that I reached out to their head office in a survey.   Surprise surprise noone called me back.  I explained that my objective wasn't free food or an apology but rather to inform them of how bad this place is.  The younger staff are always fooling around,  the managers are clueless and don't seem to provide any guidance.  Last time I was there before submitting my complaint, three other people walked out in anger and two returned uncooked food.  This was in a ten minute span...ten minutes of me waiting for a coffee and mcflurry!!!  I went to the counter for a refund after getting annoyed with waiting as three workers flirted with each other and the manager stared at the order board like he was being hypnotized.   This experience was similar to other times I went there.  Anyone I speak to says the same thing about this location.   The problem, as I see it, is that maybe it keeps hitting its sale targets due to its strong geographical location. 
1973;This is by far the worst Dairy Queen I've ever been to. The toppings are always significantly less than other locations, the employees don't seem to know what's going on, seeming disinterested or incapable . Dealing with this location is always frustrating from payment issues to not being able to provide menu items (ie: toppings, chili cheese dog, hamburger). They even refused to make a cake even though I gave them the appropriate days notice. They said they couldn't, however I could try another DQ. So I asked to speak to the manager because it didn't make sense that their store policy would be different than another's. When the well dressed manager came out to speak to me she was even less helpful than the confused employee. She couldn't even provide me with the number of another location to save me the drive. Overall, incredibly disappointing. It's sad because as a family we love their products, and this location is very convenient for us, unfortunately it's always a hassle and makes us feel unvalued as
1974;Horrible service.  We were not served for 40 mins..restaurant was empty.  One waitress was cleaning the table..one was on her cell phone. .and one was serving other guests. We got up and got our own menus..waited and still no service. Ended up eating next door at another restaurant. Very disappointing and horrible service
1975;The food taste desi.. I think they put kasuri methi in the pasta.. the Alfredo chicken had sauce that Definitely came from a jar from the grocery store..Service was not good..  dinner took Very long to come to the table.. It was very unhygienic, servers hands were touching the dishes.
1976;Went there yesterday after being there once about 6 years back . Do not order from the so called Italian menu it is garbage no flavour what so ever !!! For the price of the food you would think you would get served a simple lasagna and fettuccine Alfredo right smh they couldn't even get the salads right either . Note to the cook you don't put cinnamon in lasagna smh where in Italy do they put cinnamon in lasagna worse lasagna ever . And disgusting tasteless Alfredo with literally no sauce at al . Gross !!!!!!!!!
1977;After hearing a few good things and many bad things about this place, a group of us thought we'd give it a try anyway..Worst food experience ever!We specifically ordered early to ensure we got our food before Iftar time... instead it took them two hours to get our  food. (everyone else in the restaurant seemed to be getting their food including people who arrived after us)Horrible customer service (place seats about 50, but has ONE waiter running around). Any other restaurant would have apologized or offered a discount or something, but even when we asked to speak to the manager, we were told he was busy cooking and to just order an appetizer until our food came.. Pasta was nothing special...sauce was too thick and bland, for the price we were paying we were expecting much more. Took forever to get our bills, we were pretty much the last table out of the restaurant, they didnt even have change for cash.Complete waste of time.
1978;poor service. not worth the price on menu. arrived at 9pm, appetizers came at 9:50pm, and the restaurant closed at 10:30pm. most of the menu was not available. i am use to the service being poor, but its even worse when the food quality has gone down. the owner/cook must be tired from fasting that the food presentation was poor. the owner says he only sells 11 ounce steak in ramadan so he can earn more money- clearly he doesn't know the meaning of ramadan. when i voiced concerns they brought me more food and threw the other plate in garbage, so they are okay to waste food - odd policy for muslims especially in ramadan.
1979;This is the last time ill be in here. Sitting at the table. All the food is changed. The hosts try very hard but i believe that the management is so bad. I will never ever come here again. The steaks have changed. The sides have changed. My kid ordered a burger and he got a bun and  the patties. ???? This is outrageous. I recommend every one to stop coming here as he is not worth your money anymore. Also check this out. There was a table of 4 that came in. 1st they waited for the table to be cleaned for 20 mins. Then they waited for the servers to come for 30 MINS and NO ONE SHOWED UP. Furious the customers left.We didn't get our soup after the steaks arrived only after we asked the server and she blamed it on the new boy who was there training WITH OUT PAY. when she was the one who took the order. I am a true believe to support the halal community food  providers but this is not the way any of the customers should be treated. The steak says 9 ounce but it is hardly 4 ounce steak. Many of my readers must be 
1980;Would give 0 stars if i could. I would not recommend going here even if the meal was free. I have been here twice with my family and both times the service was completely unaccomodating. The chicken tastes stale and microwaved. Peppercorn sauce tastes like old gravy with blackpepper in it. The quality of food for every item on the table was below poor quality. Plenty of alternatives in the area for halal food, you can safely skip this restaurant and you won't regret, nor will your wallet.
1981;The worst experience in my life. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this restaurant at any cost. We had to wait in the line up just to get the menu. Then we had to wait in another line up to make the order. The food came after 50 mins. Rice were burned and their so called Italian food items were a complete joke!
1982;Food was as expected. The service was awful though. Not a single please or thank you. I felt as if being a customer was a bother. Judging by the consistently low rating that seems to be how they operate here. Until management indicates that they care about customer service at all I won't be back.
1983;This is the worst Burger King location I've ever visited. After countless times of really bad service, I've been forced to make the first ever complaint. I just came back from a visit and the burger I ordered is dry as hell. The bread looks like it's been sitting out on the counter for days. The Coke Zero taste horrible.  Never ever ordering from this horrible location.
1984;Before it is good but now looks and test old chicken and fries if you told them make fresh steel there are give you old
1985;Utterly incompetent service - every time, the drinks don't arrive, the orders are wrong, etc.  The wait staff just can't handle 3 tables each!
1986;Found a disgusting piece of long blue lint in my toast. When I brought it to the attention of the waitress she said, "Oh, it's just from the kitchen towel. They were probably wiping the counter and touched your toast with the towel." She said this as if it should somehow comfort me. Never going back again. Disgusting.
1987;Today I have diarrhea from this place. I like eggsmart but this location didn't work out for me. The dish I was served didn't look right. I got the same thing I got at the other place and it didn't taste as good, it looked way less well prepared. The sauce looked strangely runny, the potatoes not as well done, and I was served less fruit on the side. The other eggsmart I was at was on Shepard and bayview I believe and it was incredible - but this was not great. The steak too.. Not as good. And yea... This morning I'm not having fun.
1988;Went in today at 3 pm. Saw that everyone was cleaning and rushed to order. They were out of smoke salmon ordered sizzler omelette the egg was mushy and the chicken was rubbery, home fries were covered in oil. I felt kinda gross all day from all the oil. The toast was soft and mushy from all the butter drenching it. I would never go again and wouldn't recommend it.
1989;This whole situation was so depressing we left before ordering food, and still spent $4.60 on two drip coffees. Interior looks kind of like the grime you get on unscrubbed toilets, umm...what else. Nothing. Nothing at all. Does not have a smell.
1990;The store was dirty. Chicken was one of the worst KFC experience I ever had. And, the staff gave us the wrong bill for our to-go  TWICE. Never go back.
1991;I had the worst delivery experience of my life! I was at my daughters new place helping her move in. This KFC is literally from google maps so 3 minute drive or 20 minute walk. We were tired and still doing stuff so we ordered food. Well after 5 phone calls and a 10 min direction conversation with the driver we received our food 2 hrs and 15 minutes later. YES 2 hrs and 15 minutes for a 3 minute drive. Couldn't get anywhere with the manager eventually offered me a 20% discount on ice cold fries and chicken, no accessories I had asked for. The drivers interac machine wasn't working, ended up getting a discount because he was lucky I had some cash, than I found from my bank I was charged. CRAZY!!! The one star should be "0"!!
1992;Expected delivery time tonight 8:37 pm. Actual delivery time 9:48 pm. It isn't like pizza, 30 minutes and it's free. Nope. We had to phone TWICE to ask what had happened to our order tonight. We were STARVING. And we live only a block and a half away from the KFC location at 2000 Jane Street. There is simply no excuse for this.  So what did KFC offer us? They comped us the $5.00 delivery charge. BIG DEAL. The delivery person got annoyed at US that he was losing the $5.00. Now you have HAD it 2000 Jane Street KFC.  It will be a cold day in Hell before we order from you again.
1993;F(*&^ The TouristsWe ordered food from Amato on our first night in town and it was worthy of a second order. However, when we made our second order, when it came to our hotel door it was more than $10 higher than what was quoted and what the menu stated. Add to it the food was WRONG and the person on the other end of the phone was rude. Called the concierge and the menu has been pulled. Decent food, but the screw the tourist attitude is a LOSER!
1994;I would like to thank the person employed by Amato's Pizza that has allegedly stolen my husband's credit card number and used it to buy fuel for his/her car, and just tried to order take out using it.  We used this card one time in Toronto, for pizza take out from Amato's to our hotel room.  In the time since, the card was used twice in the Toronto area. Thank God for American Express fraud service.  Can you let the person know that the card is now listed as stolen?  Thanks!
1995;Don't order delivery unless you like dealing with aggressive extortionists. Guy tried to pry out a $13 tip on a $27 order. Disgusting behaviour. Avoid.
1996;I have traveled across the United States looking for the best pizza man can make.  I have had pizza at two place in Canada and this is the second one and my opinion this is worse than frozen pizza you buy at the supermarket and cook yourself.  I had a really bad feeling when I called in to place my delivery order and the person tried to get me to order a medium pizza ($17.00) instead of a small ($13.28).  The size of the pizza is good and the price was a bit high for the poor quality of the food.  The food was 100% tasteless.
1997;I'd call Amato's a last resort but it's not even that. I think I'd rather go hungry, or at least walk down to Pizza Pizza or Big Slice.Amato's pizza is just not tasty. The last slice I remember having here was sometime in my first year of university, and it was spinach and feta...which is kinda hard to screw up. Yet the spinach was dry and crusty, the feta was old and cold, and the pizza was hard as a rock.The food tastes awful and no one cares to fix it. There are so many good pizza places in this city, and even on Yonge street. Go to them instead, hopefully Amato's will shut down and free up the space for a better restaurant.
1998;The worst experience ever. Terrible customer service , they don't care about the customer. I waited 2 1/2 hrs for my pizza and they wanted to still charge me. The driver had the audacity to flip me off.  Bad just really bad!! I. Thought I was getting punk'd. It was that bad, unreal!!
1999;Placed an order online. Got a call from an employee claiming the transaction didn't go through. They asked for my credit card number again. It got stolen. I had to cancel my credit card and claim 3 transactions.
2000;Amato on Yonge St. is a horrible little hole in the wall restaurant doesn't deserve your money or your patronage! My gripe isn't with the pizza, which was actually quite okay, but the incredible rudeness of the staff. Last weekend, after a movie, we went in using a Groupon for an 18" "classic" pizza. First off, nobody greeted us, in fact, we were ignored until we called them over (they were very busy chatting with each other).It wasn't clear as to what "classic" meant or what toppings this Groupon entitled us to, so we asked what our options were. We got a snarky response of "anything up here", which I took to mean the top row, but we weren't given any further clarification. We wanted a basic pepperoni, mushroom and onion pizza, but we didn't see one display (and I couldn't discern what some of the toppings were) and some of them weren't labeled, so we tried to get more information. Another guy came over and made some sense so we put in our order--the one without the label and the mystery toppings (addition
2001;The pizza itself: edible. The quality wasn`t great...the dough was chewy and the toppings weren`t fresh.THE CUSTOMER SERVICE: the worst I`ve ever encountered. We ordered through Just Eat, and the pizzas arrived 20 minutes later than the time given (totaling an hour and twenty minutes). When I called the store to ask where the pizza was and how long it would take, the man on the phone was unhelpful. He said they only have one driver and there`s nothing he can do about my order being late he did NOT offer a discount even give an apology. He just said that there was nothing he can do. We are located down the street from them, so I couldn't understand why it was taking so long (I could've walked there and back within half an hour, but I couldn't leave my location at the time). When the pizzas arrived, one of them was wrong (we requested no cheese on one, and it had cheese on it). My friend, being vegan, was unable to eat the cheesy pizza, so we had to call the store, AGAIN, to request a new pizza. When the del
2002;Just got wings and pizza which somehow came to $60. The food took a long time to come and the pizza was ice cold. The hot sauce was spilled all over the wings because the lid wasn't closed properly so my friend couldn't eat any (we asked for it on the side). I called to explain all of this and was berated by the rude onsite manager. For $60 never again!
2003;Oct 2016: Had to edit our review, this location has gone downhill fast and we will never order from here again.  Don't bother wasting your money!
2004;I will never order here again. The delivery man was SO RUDE...I cannot believe he is still working there, because apparently I'm not the only one who has experienced this. He even called my CELLPHONE BACK, to cuss me out ... about his tip.I didn't have change and forgot to tip online, I sincerely apologized and thanked him for his services and being so prompt ... and he cussed me out & thought I was some teenager playing some sorta practical joke.& when I opened my food, I WAS SOO DISGUSTED. I ate it ... which was the sad part ... but the alfredo sauce was so unbelievably WATERY. It was a giant pond of oily ... watery sauce ... at the bottom of the pan. The alfredo sauce itself ... was disgusting. Not well seasoned ... not even black pepper at the least! Shrimp undercooked, pasta undercooked. & don't even get me started on the garlic bread. Like what is this? This looks like a cheese pizza with garlic sprinkled on it ... and it doesn't even taste good!! It tasted like frozen pizza heated up in the microwave
2005;What a huge disappointment, paid $40 for two pizzas, ate one slice and through everything out.  It honestly tasted worse then a 7 dollar Delissio from shoppers, which I wish I had instead.Sauce tastes like it comes from a grocery store shelf, crust have no texture or character, cheese was budget.  I am asking just eat for a refund.  I never leave reviews, this spot was just so bad I have to earn everyone.
2006;I ordered a pizza with them over the phone, gave them my address. No one said anything, it was fine. I get a call a half an hour later (pizza was expected in forty minutes) that they can't send me the pizza. I'm just a stoned gal who wants some pizza late at night, they should have told me when I ordered they couldn't deliver to me. They were extremely unapologetic about it and rude.Twenty minutes later I get a call from their delivery man, 647.701.2008 that they are downstairs with my pizza. I told them our pizza was cancelled and was confused. He had no idea. He hangs up. I call back, and say my roommate will still take the pizza, he starts yelling at me and "to go fuck my roommate." if I could give them less than one star I would. I ordered a pizza and got ringed into a circus where I was verbally abused.
2007;this was the single worst slice of pizza i have ever had. the place is FILTHY and really expensive. just go to panago on bay street!
2008;In town for Festival and after leaving one club Friday night, we ordered a large pizza and wings for delivery to the hotel. We were told we had to order pizza because the kitchen stopped cooking pasta at some random earlier time. We were told the pizza would arrive in 45 minutes. Approximately TWO and a HALF hours later , our pizza was delivered to our hotel. Somehow the pizza was burnt and cold at the same time. The wings were dry rubbery and cold as well.We called the restaurant  and no one answered. Saturday morning we called and the day manager stated we had to call back in the evening after 6 to make a complaint. We called after 6 and the manager argued with us stating 45 minutes was just an estimated time. He never apologized for the cold pizza or the wings. He told us he would not send us a new pizza and he would not give us a refund so what did we want.  We wanted him to at least apologize and offer to make it right. He refused to acknowledge anything was wrong. He finally said we could come pick up
2009;I work in the area and used to pop in for a slice a few times a week. A large part of their business is the single slice market. Well, the prices used to be under $4 so there was no PST. They put the price up to $4.01, so it costs an extra $0.32 in taxes, for what? A two cent profit??Didn't seem very customer service oriented to me, so I emailed them. Big surprise, no reply!The last few times I was in, the slices were all curled up on the display racks like they were dried out from sitting out too long. I have to agree with another reviewer also, the place is really dirty.It's too bad that they've gone way down hill over the years.Consequently, they've lost my business.
2010;This was the worst pizza ever. The only thing I can say good was it was hot/ tasted bad, and wings were not tasty and scary to look at. Came to 32 dollars and delivery guy thought his .6 miles warranted a 8 $ tip, no. I hope this place goes under so a new mediocre  place can open. Feel free to contact me.
2011;This review is solely based on customer service....I never actually got to try the pizza!I attempted to order a pizza and called the restaurant at about 11:30 am to place a pick up order. I was told by a male employee that they were very busy and my pizza would not be available until 1pm (I mentioned that I would be using a Groupon and this information came after that....first sign of something wrong). That seemed odd to me, but I went ahead with the order and asked them to have it ready for 1:30pm (I was heading to a meeting and was initially hoping to pick it up on the way, but with the later timing decided I could pick it up after my meeting). I called in again at about 1:45pm before heading over just to confirm that the pizza would be ready. A female employee answered and she had no idea about my order. She said that there were no pick up orders there. Then she asked if I had a Groupon and went on to say that I would have to come in and place an order. I certainly was not going to go there and wait for h
2012;I wish I had read the reviews before coming here.I walked in because I found the smell alluring, but the pizza I discovered there was too expensive and not up to par. While the staff was nice and accomodating, the place was extremely dirty, stuffy (even with the door wide open), and disorganized.Not going back there again, that's for sure.
2013;GROUPON USERS BEWARE! Well, it's amazing how fast things can change. I walked in with my other Groupon on December 24 and was promptly refused service by a disgruntled manager/owner who pretty much told me to get lost. I tried to reason, showing him the fine print on the voucher-but that went nowhere. I left after he said: "I DONT HAVE TIME TO MAKE 'GROUPONS', IT's gonna take 90 minutes, im busy, I tell Groupon to fix ad and they didnt, come back when im not busy!" And it's not like this is my first time going to Amato's- this established has delivered for my various work events (..they are angels on the phone btw), I've picked up/paid retail for their pizza in person, even used 1 Groupon in the summer (..3am in the morning) and no problem whatsoever. Needless to say, I will not be returning in any capacity.Best of luck to all my extended Groupon familia.
2014;Wow .......I just had to write a review for this Taco Bell Cause I just had the most ridiculous experience ever !Ok so we're in a rush ...so what does this mean ?Hello Drive thru.........what a BAD MISTAKE ! IT TOOK 19 minuets ...yes I said 19 minutes what a joke ....then they gave the wrong order and wrong receipt .....so we go back in to complain and the manager says to email head office ....wow! Email them what a JOKE!!!!! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!
2015;visited this location recently- had a horrible experience- Sent an email off to head office- no one has answered me yet about it and also made a notation on the Taco bell Canada Facebook Page and no one has responded.  so bad customer service from both ends.  Don't waste your time or your money.
2016;What a horrible location. There is garbage all over the floor, garbage all over the booths, garbage all over the tables. There is a line up of people almost out the door and it looks like there is one person making food and one person working cash.The tables, chairs and booths are all dirty and look like they haven't been cleaned all day. I am so disgusted that I don't want to think about how dirty it is behind the counter. I think I will never come back here as I would like to avoid getting the Ebola virus from this dirt hole.
2017;This has got to be the dirtiest place I have ever eaten at. There wasn't a single clean table and your shoes stick to the floor as you walk. On the couple of occasions I have come here my order is usually wrong. Guess it's to hard to read a screen and place food in a bag.
2018;Wanted to try a rice and chicken dish. Very simple choice, can't go wrong. Tasted super bland. I found some cartilage parts in my chicken. I had to discreetly spit them out. Mango lassi was okay. Friendly service. Not authentic or anything. Skip it.
2019;Horrible, over-priced food. I ordered a butter-chicken wrap. What I got:  soggy, buttery pink rice inside a tiny wrap with one chunk of cucumber.  I was already regretting it when I saw the girl behind the counter making it. Will never go there again.
2020;Wow, it wasn't until I came here that I realized you can screw up Indian food so badly.  I really should have known better and read the reviews but I really had to grab something quick during my lunch hour as I wasted a good part of it at Dollarama in that same building, waiting the long line.  In any case, I had the "classic Indian bowl" and it was horrendous.  I ordered the paneer and I have never tasted such watery paneer in my life.  The cheese cubes were the size of my finger tips (I have small fingers) and I counted a total of 5 cheese cubes in that bowl of stuff.  The rest of my spinach mixture was watery, salty, and gross.  It was such an epic waste of calories.  Definitely go to Matagali's nearby instead
2021;I was really hungry and needed some food quickly . They ran out of biriyani so took the three item thali . I have never tasted something so bland in my life . Only pros the girl who gave was nice . They give you frozen pita in place of a naan . For me why even bother because I  won't eat it . Don't waste your money
2022;Blurgh. Terrible. Believe the bad reviews. On a positive note, the basmati rice was properly cooked.
2023;This Tim Hortons probably deserves a zero but I'll give it a 5 star rating for the amount of mistakes they make. If this business runs on mistakes no wonder they are still around. I am not sure if the manager here tells there employees to puposly forget items after a customer has paid to increase there profits. I can't even count in the last month how many times my wife and I have gone through drive through and either we have to turn around - which is the biggest inconvenience in this location due to the horrible parking lot it's in, or being half way to our destination realizing we are missing food or the coffee was made incorrectly. I should have known about the horrible incompetence at this location when a couple years back I asked for a double double and guess what I got instead??! A HOT STEAMING CUP OF WATER!! If I was even to scold myself I couldn't even imagine the lawsuit I could have filed. But I was in a rush to get to work and didn't really make a big shpeal about it.Anyways I try to avoid this
2024;Shittiest drive thru service ever. Never coming back. Never going to recommend. Want to be treated like shit...this is the place.
2025;"Worst indian resturant in the GTA"Ugly decor and horrible location. They had picnic table clothes for their tables. The place was very dirty they never clean the place. The food is just horrible, tasted very old, bland and clearly it as microwaved. Especially their Chicken Biryani, it tasted very bland no flavors and tasted like it was in the microwave. The chicken in the other hand was also bland tasted like rubber with no seasonings and it was very DRY. Worst texture for a chicken!  When i asked for a glass of water, they gave me a styrofoam cup with water and even the water tasted odd. Clearly it was in that  werid looking water jug/pitcher for days and they haven't bother changing the water or maybe cleaning the jug/pitcher. After a few hours I felt sick. This is the worst resturant experiance I've had in a resturant.If your looking for a decent indian resturant do not come here you will be wasting your time and of course your money. You're better off somewhere else.Never coming back here again.
2026;I ordered for delivery a couple of days ago and I have one word DISGUSTING. I took one bite of the Desi Ghee paratha and I was certain it had been out for days, not to mention it was totally burnt. Samosas were equally as bad.  I got the the chicken tikka masala aswell (a dish you can hardly go wrong with in any decent indian/pakistani establishment). The chicken tasted funny, gagged a little bit (not exaggerating) and the sauce hardly had flavour.  The chana masala and the butter naan I got were the lesser of evils or so I thought. I fell sick the next day, spent most of my time in the washroom the next few days. Thanks 786 halal Biryani house. I'm appalled at the lack of quality, this place shouldnt be allowed to serve food.
2027;Ewww GROSS!! I ordered the butter chicken and garlic nan. Got to work and opened it up and took one bite. Disgusting. The nan smelled great but didn't seem to have the right consistency or texture.
2028;I got a special: 1 meat, veggie and two sauces, or something like that. The meal itself was great very delicious. But within half an hour I could barely walk and for the next two days I was stuck in bed from food poisoning. Yea, I won't be eating here again...
2029;This place is definitely a miss. Tried it once for lentil soup and it had a weird powdery after taste and seemed a bit watered down. Gave it another shot - tried the veggie chili - basically tomato soup with mushy beans - no veggies in sight.
2030;Way overpriced for what tastes like canned soup. You can get better soup at Longos for close to half the price or just go sit down at a proper restaurant and pay the same price! Ridiculous.
2031;Have you ever wished you had the ability to turn back time.I wish I did, I wouldn't have waited my money on an extremely poor decision.I ordered a "large salad with beef" which is really the same as a medium but inside a half full large container.This salad amounted to nothing more than iceburg lettuce, some slices of cucumbers and tomato and a thin layer of meat.  The majority of this monstrosity was slathered with garlic and hot sauce.Everything about this was mediocre at best.  The biggest kicker of all? This was a $16 salad.
2032;This is by far the slowest service at any osmow's... and it already has it chicken cut up and chop ready to go. Which makes the chicken dry but yet somehow they still manage to have slow service. I have been here numerous times due it being close to work. Regardless if there are 5 or more customers or just me... it will take them 20 mins + to get the order ready
2033;The food is good, but the service there is VERY SLOW.  I decided to try this place out today (Friday November 4th 2016).  I arrived at around 1:12 PM.  The restaurant was quite busy.  By the time I stood in line and placed my order, a few minutes had passed.  My receipt is stamped 1:17 PM.  I then stood and waited for my name to be called.  I had ordered a super sized chicken shawarma sandwich.At 1:41 PM I witnessed them put together my sandwich and put it on the grill. (24 minutes after I placed my order).  My name was finally called at 1:45 PM!  That is a full 28 minutes after I had placed my order (and over half an hour since I entered the restaurant).I realize that it was the lunchtime rush, but I doubt anyone wants to waste that much time waiting for a sandwich.  I was not the only one frustrated by the excessive wait times.  The staff seemed to have trouble tracking what food was for what order.  There is a very obvious deficiency in their order process.  As far as I am concerned, if they cannot s
2034;This place has no connection to middle eastern food. Honestly, do they real think they have good shawarma?? They trick you with good tasting sauce on top of bad tasting meat, that's all. the staff has no idea what middle eastern food is. shawarma does not come from a frying pan. it comes from a large sizzling meat skewer that the meat gets shaved off it.
2035;Food is good, but they're very slow! Also people who ordered after us received their meals before we did! I'm not coming back here....
2036;The food is delicious but I cannot handle the VERY SLOW service. I have been to this location 3 times (it's close to my work) and I have gone at different times and it does not fail that every time I go, I wait close to 30 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!! That is insane. It's NOT a good option for lunch because not only are you hungry you are waiting forever. Porta Via on Eglinton is always packed and I do not spend more than 10 minutes in that restaurant.They really need to figure out an assembly line or some time management skills. I love osmow's but I will not be back
2037;Hero Burger is probably the worst burger joint out there. My friends and I decided to come here to get a bite. What really got on my nerves that they had poor management. They only had one person running the place. His position was the chef/cashier. The burger was not cooked good which led me to feel sick. I'm never going back to this place and I will stop eating Hero Burger.
2038;Dangerous food handling ALLERT: Although Hero Burger is known for its good food, it is also known for its pride in offering Gluten free food, and they offer "Gluten Intolerance/Celiac Disease Statement" on their website.   I was severely disappointed, with their lack of knowledge and food safety handling. As i ordered  gluten free meal, and had stated on multiple occasions that everything MUST be gluten free due to a food allergy, i came home to find that my Gluten free burger was in a regular white NOT gluten free bun! had this been my first visit, i would not have known that something was wrong, by simply looking at my food, luckily i hesitate to consume the food, (and after discarding the one bite i initially took) right away i contacted the store directly and they in fact confirmed that the food was not handled properly, and the bun was NOT gluten free! Due to their negligence they had put me a serious risk. And were not willing to accommodate properly, resolve the issue professionally, and the manager w
2039;Wouldn't take my order by phone when I was on my way there with no time to wait for it to be made after I arrive. It's a shame that places lose business like this. I decided not to go there but go the other way and find a different place to buy my burger.
2040;Fries were cold and soggyHe dressed the burger before the meet was done so the bun was soggy too...But this location is never busy cause its no good.. So you wont have to wait
2041;No way. No. Never again.My rating: 0 stars.How could you butcher the egg roll? Walmart egg rolls are better than these flat empty flappy thingies. To this, I say NO! And NO to your over-battered ridiculously-small chicken dish..dammit I forgot the name (was it General Tso? Kung pow looked awful too)anywho...only eat this food if you plan to throw it back up. OR - go ahead and eat and regret your choice for life!!Where to eat instead when you're stuck at York: 1) "The Islands" a couple doors down has great lunch deals, and 2) Indian flavour restaurant. These places offer the next best thing to a home cooked meal. And that lassi @ Indian flavour?? to DIE for!
2042;If I could give ZERO STARS I would. The manager is completely unreasonable to allow for the customer in front of me to get sauce added to their meal for no extra charge but for me he wanted to charge me. The lady serving me was more than willing to accommodate my simple request but he felt the need to actually argue with me! There were no customers behind me so he was in no rush whatsoever. I told him I no longer wanted to give him my business and he discarded my order into the trash BUT waited til he thought I was out sight and instructed his staff to scrape the food back into the serving trays! I have video of them doing this and will be filing an official sanitation, health and safe food practice complaint. Do not eat here.
2043;This place is god-awful and should be closed down.Any type if meat is dry and tasteless... Meaning it's been sitting there for days if not weeks!Total disgust
2044;This place is a joke. Quick slap-together anything goes shawarma by way of the lousiest service. A 'lady' (using the term loosely) made my sandwich with everything in it when I was in the back of a line (four people ahead of me)... By the time I was in front of her, I had to tell her what to remove and never mind the white pita I would overlook. She looked thoroughly inconvenienced. The irony. Get this- You have to pay extra for tabouli and hummus (huh?!). The staff argued that this is normal (righhht)Plus- Fee for use of debit. Again. Same refrain: "they do that next door too"-OK, so I WON'T be back here OR wherever 'next door' is.Best part- the staff insults you to your face in Arabic. A few summers in Tunis have given me enough working knowledge of Arabic to know when someone is throwing racist slurs at both me (African gal) and the guy ahead of me (south-Asian customer).I'll happily turn the other cheap for a good shawarma but didn't even get that. It es terrible.Never again.  I RECOMMEND-
2045;I recently moved to this area and I love middle Eastern food so I decided to try this place. When I went in there was one other person and the staff (2 people) seemed busy. They took my order, but didn't start preparing my order. I don't usually mind waiting more than average wait times because sometimes they get busy and we are all human after all. However, after waiting 20 minutes, the older staff asked me if I wanted ketchup twice. At the 2nd time, I told her you asked me that just before and she said, "I forgot". When I got my order, I mentioned that I waited for 20 minutes. Her answer was.... "There's nothing we can do". She didn't even say sorry for the wait. And what's even more rude is "If you just be patient". Ok, do I just have to be patient in a restaurant of this type? The whole business concept is one gets food quickly.  I'll guess I'll have to find another Middle Eastern place. It was down right rude.
2046;Nope!ConsUndercooked falafel balls...no crunch.Something was super salty..50 extra for tabbouleh...really?  It's standard at many places.Wilted lettuce and the other ingredients looked a bit anemic.Waxed paper melted into pita due to grilling.ProsProvided seating and calories.
2047;Sure, it's quick.  It's got some good hot peppers and pickles.  And there's an Asian woman who seems to be some kind of manager or supervisor, who is kind and on the ball.But that's the only thing going for it.Compared to any Chicken Shawarma, Quick Pita employees have been heavily trained to wrap meager toppings into a dry wrap - something that is masked by the wax paper wrapping.  Here's what happens:There is a woman there (older, possibly Eastern European) who puts about 5 or 6 thin strips of shredded lettuce into the wrap.  So I ask for more.  She adds another 4 or 5, and somehow doesn't understand the meaning of 'more'.  She does the same for the tomato and the onion.  Today I had two pieces of tomato - each of them were the size of a quarter.  So I asked for more.  She added one more piece the size of a loonie.  Absolutely ridiculous.  All of this served with a scowl.On top of that, she added pieces of chicken that were burned and dry that did nothing for the flavour of the wrap.I will not ret
2048;It's sad when an employee makes you not want to be a customer anymore.This is a Quick Pita / Steak and Cheese Factory joint venture. I've ordered things from SaCF through Just-Eat a couple of times, for delivery, and loved it, the food and the service. The last of those times the delivery guy suggested me to order directly with them.I tried to order it on a Saturday. It was 10 PM and the pamphlet said they were open 'til 11, so I figured out, there should be no problem. A kinda clueless teenage girl took my whole order, confirmed it, confirmed my address, got my credit card info, only to call me back 10 minutes after to tell me that it was too late to order.You could have checked that before getting my order, but that's fine.Then today I tried to order again, the same teenage girl took my order but this time she told me they'd send the credit card machine with the delivery guy and I would pay it at the actual delivery. Great! Food gets here, the delivery guy who doesn't speak or understands a word of 
2049;absolute garbage. i asked for a falafel. i was given raw falafel. it was a disgusting experience. falafel should be crispy at the very least. i understand that you can source lebanese ingredients but at least fry them until crispy!!
2050;I made my yelp account specifically for this restaurant. First of all from outside, it looks good with its flashy lights. However, once inside it's a totally different story. I am in a protein diet, so I ask for beef shawarma meat, to be placed on my tabouli. Everything seems fine, but once the bill is ready, I realize it's the same price as the plate. I ask how can just meet and tabouli be the same price as a plate. I ask for manager which she calls. He tells me policy is Same price doesn't matter  if plate or not. How the hell does that make sense. To make matters worse the beef was all dry and not seasoned good. As for the tabouli it's just cut up parsley and onions and whatever goes on it all dried up in the Container, once you order it they put lemon juice on it. Like come on if I wanted parsley with lemon on top I would make it at home. Will not go there again!!!!!
2051;Had chicken shawarma plate. The food here sucks and the quality is horrible. The chicken is overly done, there is more skin than meat, potatoes are over-cooked. I will never eat here again....
2052;Came here to grab a quick dinner.I ordered a chicken shawarma and was quite disappointed. There were many pieces of dry chicken that were as sharp as a broken piece of plastic. I seriously thought that someone was trying to kill me. For $6 it was quite thin. Apparently all the ingredients were in there.There's a first for everything...
2053;Can't get much worse than this. Wanted the kefta kabob, overheard some conversation behind the counter saying it was frozen, was told "we don't have that." OK, so I ordered the basic chicken shwarma pita (becuase the plate was priced at around $12, which seemed pretty pricey for this run-down looking place). My chicken didn't come from the usual rotating shawarma stick - nope, it came from a metal bin of pre-cut chicken that was sitting on the grill. I thought 'no big deal' as I've seen other shawarma places do this when they're busy (although these guys weren't). Well the chicken was so dry and burned it was actually crunchy. Not cripsy, but CRUNCHY. And had that burned, charred dried out taste and crumbly texture. Pita they use tastes stale. They charge extra for extra hummus??? To top it all off, tried to pay by credit card, woman couldn't figure out how to produce a copy of the receipt for me, when I asked for the copy she already printed, she tells me "No, you can't have that. We need that." And proceeds
2054;Had a 3 hr layover to Vancouver. Flight left from terminal 3. Two choices for food, basic Tim Hortons( coffee doughnuts and muffins) or the Distillery. Entered into Distillery and sat at bar for close to 10 minutes. Made eye contact with waitresses with no results. Decided to see if there were other options a floor down. More Tim Hortons. Was hungry so back to the Distillery and said to hostess" let's try this again". Ordered a 16 oz Mill St organic Amber lager $8   Tasted like Canadian. Took almost 20 minutes for the Angus burger@ $14 with fries. Nothing to write home about.  You think the owner would staff better. Unfortunately for the time being it is the only place in the terminal for sit down food. Hopefully they get some competition soon.
2055;No napkins or utensils provided. Waitress disappeared. Asked the loud table behind me how things were...not me, then raced away with no eye contact. Still waiting for the bill....or utensils....chicken club sandwich was ok. Salad might have been fine if I had a fork. Food ok. Service atrocious.
2056;The newest part of Terminal 3 at Pearson Airport is bereft of places to eat.  I recently had connecting flights at Pearson, and after making it through customs, rechecking my baggage and walking the 20 minutes to this section of the airport, I was left with 10 minutes before boarding to find lunch.  At this terminal there are three options for food: The Distillery has a full service restaurant, a small cooler of to-go food and there is a Tim Hortons that serves only coffee and donuts.  Alright then, Distillery to-go it is.  The food at the to-go counter is absurdly overpriced, I would have been better off buying West Jet food on the plane.  I got a turkey sandwich that rang up at over $15 with tax (no drink, chips or any sides), and it was the worst sandwich I have had in years.  The bread was soggy, the lettuce was brown, the tomato was slimy and the garlic from the spread they put on it was completely overpowering.  I choked down about half before I tossed the sandwich and decided to just eat the potato c
2057;Stopped for a beer here after a flight got pushed back an hour. Can't speak for the food, and the Mill St beer is good, but I can speak for the service. And it was horrible. The waitress took our first drink order and everything seemed ok. Then she came back a while later and I ordered a second. At that point I thought the rapture happened and she was the only one taken. After the beer never came and becoming fed up with waiting, we went up to the bar to pay and get the hell out. She gave us the bill with the never-delivered beer on it, and when we pointed out that we didn't get it, she said "oh" and brought back an updated receipt. I think I would have a better experience trying to make toilet wine in the Terminal 3 washroom than ever have to deal with The Distillery again.
2058;The beer, being Mill Street, was good, albeit not worth $12 for a pint. The food, however, is another matter. I ordered the fish and chips, and although they tasted fine, I can tell the after effects of MSG and other gross chemicals (i.e., I boarded my flight with a headache, hot flushed cheeks, overall spacey feeling). This type of food should be illegal, and Mill Street should be ashamed of themselves. Service was lovely.
2059;The food was horrible, seriously, breakfast! How hard can it be, and when complained basically, oh well! I would not eat here again! I guess good news for them, I do t come to the Toronto airport very often
2060;Appalling food.  Can't believe that they charge for what they serve. Avoid the Chicken Pot Pie, containing approx 2 small pieces of actual chicken, and served with frozen peas and peculiar mashed potatoes.
2061;Still waiting for my food. 32 minutes in.  We are here with two kids and they're absolutely starving. I didn't think pasta took this long to prepare.
2062;Horrible food at high prices. They used to be good but now, all their foods are of very low quality and not cooked the way you ask for. Service is poor too and some of the staff are very rude. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE.
2063;Sabrina, horrible manager. I only got up to making a reservation and I am already repelled by the service they were giving me.
2064;Definitely a great hangout place for the young and families but food is too off. There are plenty of options and lengthy menus but the taste of the food is either to sweet, salty or bland. Burgers are often dried, Greek food tastes like baby food, steak is alright but the poor vegetables accompanying it , looks that they have been in a steaming sauna. Their pumper nickel bread is a good starter. Prices are too high for just average unsatisfying food. The lengthy food menu definitely is a weak point and reduces quality significantly.
2065;Went last night for a birthday gathering. A few people didn't even eat there main meal it was so tasteless. My salad was terrible, shredded ice berg lettuce with a tasteless dressing and hard to eat because the pieces where so small. Then I thought mussels would be a safe bet but I was wrong the broth was greasy and had not flavor whatsoever with I'm sure frozen tasteless shredded carrots and tomatoes. Couldn't even tell they were tomatoes bits "no taste to them at all". Too bad, I was hoping for a nice interesting meal. And I ordered a "Toronto Margarita" which they list the ingredients as a traditional Margarita but I was again super disappointed that it was made with a powder or syrup and was terrible and I've tried many in the past and I'd have to say this was the worst. Sorry :(. But they need to make changes here to compete against other restaurants like themselves!! I only gave a star for the wonderful company we had :)
2066;I would give minus stars if I could. For some stupid reason I came back to this restaurant and again, had a horrible experience. The staff here is the worst. Not only did we complain, but a woman was very frustrated with the hostess as we arrived, and another couple was in line behind us to speak to the manager. I can't even believe this location is still open.On top of all this! I wrote an email to the co-operator or whatever (Arthur) earlier in the week and I haven't yet received a reply. Really disgusting service by this location.
2067;Really bad experience at this location. Went on a Friday around 8pm, 3 guests (including myself).Service - not worthy of the title, sorry. I arrived later than my friends, but she figured that we already knew what we wanted. She kept rushing us to order. Want us to order faster PB? Have a smaller menu. We ordered wine with our main, she spilled at least a quarter of mine on the table and wiped it up and did not top up my drink... After RUSHING us all through the beginning of our meal, she was nowhere to be seen for dessert...Oh, nobody at the front desk greeted me or asked me why I was hanging around (was waiting for my friend to get me). Pretty shitty service.My friend forgot her ID and the waitress LECTURED us on why she needed to have her ID to order drinks. My friend, before this lecture, had already said it was fine as it was her fault she didn't have an ID. Don't know why the lecture was necessary, we're not 14, we get it.Food - Two starters to share:Mozzarella sticks - no flavour, I could easil
2068;I don't have high expectations for PB - never have. My family likes to go here for some reason and I don't object on account of being a good person. Also, although not great, it's not the worst restaurant out there......or is it?????Last night my boyfriend and I ordered the chicken fajitas. They came and I was preparing my first one and all of a sudden I smelled something weird. I stupidly ignored this warning, not thinking it could be coming from my food and took a bite. Big effing mistake. My taste buds were violated to a degree which still almost makes me gag when I recall the memory. It was disgusting. The chicken was bad - my boyfriend said it made him think of a really gross rubber but it made me think of infections. This was a serious offense. Whoever is in charge over there needs to get it together. Disgusting.
2069;If I can give pickle barrel negative stars I would.I eat it out everyday, I have experienced both the Good and the Bad of Toronto's restaurant scene.Pickle Barrel is the worst restaurant I have ever entered. The food was late, cold and disgusting. I hated every moment of it.They even managed to screw up french fries.
2070;I'm sitting in pickle barrel now. Food options for vegetarians is small and very bland. Way to over priced.
2071;Waited 2 hours for delivery (I ended up ordering from somewhere else in the meantime as I assumed my food wasn't coming) When it finally did show up the delivery guy was rude and not only was the food ice cold (obviously) but it wasn't what I ordered... Even the drinks were wrong - I think someone stapled the order to the wrong bag or something. Regardless it was a terrible experience. Especially when I'm only a block away.  If I wasn't babysitting a newborn I would have walked over and gotten it myself and/or brought it back over to ask what the hell happened.
2072;I used to go to this place a lot but unfortunately the service and food quality has changed a lot. We went for my sister birthday there and it supposed to be a surprise party. IT took longe time before the server come to us and also after we order we had to wait almost 30min for our food. later when they brought the cake before my sister cut the cake I noticed the cake was wrong one! They had brought someone else's cake!!! the servant did not even say sorry and did not seem he cared at all.I went back a couple of months later and again the food quality was not good at all! the glasses were so old! Never would go back there again!
2073;I waited two hours for my food to arrive (delivery) and it is ice cold. I got the Santa Fe quinoa bowl and the dressing tastes like vomit. I have nothing else to say, other than ew!
2074;The service was awful. We were only one of two tables. My friend asked for water, and they only brought 1 glass. Then I asked and it took forever to arrive.We were never greeted. We had to ask for everything... we asked for him to take our order for coffee. Waiter never came back to refill our coffee. We had to hunt him down.We also had to ask him to take our order. Which he got wrong.Never checked on us after the food was delivered.... COLD(Yuk to COLD eggs). We had to ask for everything. Worst experience by a waiter... and the award goes to PB team.Will never return
2075;On the rare occasion, I go to Pickle Barrel, I don't expect much. On the other hand, I also expect the food to meet a minimum standard of edibility. Tonight, PB failed the test. There is no need to go into detail about the entire meal. You probably know what you're going to get with PB. However, I do want to comment on the chicken fajitas. My girlfriend made her fajita before mine, took a bite and immediately asked me to smell the meat. My first reaction was that she was being a bit dramatic (on account of being Virginia) but alas, she was correct. The smell of that meat was the most disgusting thing I've smelled in a restaurant. Honestly, how does that get out of the kitchen? This wasn't just something that was not to our tastes. This stuff was vile.We sent it back and proceeded with our meal but the memory lingers...
2076;Went here with my friends and the service we got was unbelievably rude. He treated us with disrespect and took advantage of us simply because we are teenagers. We get seated and it takes him at least a good half hour to taker order while he passed back and fourth near our table. If we wanted hot sauce we were not rude in asking saying "Give me some f**king hot sauce!". There were more please and may I, sorry to trouble you. The waiter would roll hi eyes as if we were saying something rude to him. Towards the end when my friend asked for a moist hand wipe, he was rude and said "We give those out for rib orders, theres a washroom right there can't you use that?" How rude, then came the bill, he passed by at least 6 times, and when he glanced down to look at what my friend was paying with which a $50 dollar bill, he grunts, rolls his eyes and walks away. 10 minutes later after telling him we were in a hurry, he comes back and says to my friend with aggravated behaviour, "Look I can't take that! You have to go to
2077;I just bought a salad to go from the take out area, and as soon as I got home and opened my salad there was a dead fly in my salad, i will never ever buy or eat at the pickle barrel again. How could a restaurant operate like this and stay open. The was a waste of 7 dollars.
2078;I've always felt "less is more" when it comes to a menu. Their over-sized menu offers a boatload of dreck and few highlights I've never been dazzled with any of the fare. The service at the Yonge and Eg locale is particularly egregious, and the wait is frequently quite long.Obligatory Restaurant Pun: Finding fault with this place is like shooting fish in a BARREL.Menu Readability: PB's menu is about as thick as a R.L. Stine novel and equally horrific.Need to mention: I don't like this place. Don't eat here.What this place teaches me about myself: I don't automatically love places with Pickle in the title.
2079;Ordered a lobster jumbo shrimp pasta...and there was exactly 2 small pieces of lobster and tons of pasta. Wanted to complain to the manager but I couldn't since it was a corporate lunch. For $20 a pasta, I was expecting a bit more. Server kept messing up our order as well...about three times to be exact. Ordered a cafe mocha in a To go cup, and it was half full. I think this is enough reason to render a 1 star rating...
2080;location location location. Is there any other reason this place still exists?I've been dragged here too many times in my life. I would rather eat fast food. I think that says enough.I remember being moderately satisfied by their milkshake. Otherwise they're like 0 for 12 on meal attempts.
2081;Coach decided we should meet the team at a central location for drinks and food. Yonge & Eg was this central location and she picked this place. Besides the company, nothing was good about this visit.1. The menu was overwhelming, it was a book! It's great to know that they have a large variety of food offerings, but I got tired after page 4.2. It was understandably busy. It was Saturday evening afterall. There was about 30 minutes between getting our drink orders and food orders. While our food was served, our server was nowhere to be seen and we just ordered more drinks with a random server.3. The eight of us ordered at the same time, however, my meal took an additional 15 minutes to arrive. It was a chicken sandwich with fries, so I'm not sure why that took so long and I was just sat at the table watching my friends eat. 4. My friend's soup had a hair in it. Maybe it was the kitchen, or the server with squaggly beard and hair. Who knows? They did replace it, so he joined me in watching the rest of o
2082;I have been to this restaurant about ten times. This was due to the fact that I gave it a few chances, and the other times I was sadly meeting friends there, who were clueless about how this place is.This Pickle Barrel has two main problems: a lack of cleanliness, and a generally lousy staff.Firstly, the place just is not clean. Out of all the times I have been there, I have always experienced receiving at least one fork or knife rolled in my white napkin that had a fair amount of somebody else's meal on it. I also find it gross how most of their white cloth napkins have some human hair wrapped in them which usually varies in size and quantity. Moreover, every once in a while you get your ice cream in a glass cup that reeks of that smell one's dishes have when one has failed to properly wash off the residue of chicken, beef, or eggs that came into contact with them in the sink or dishwasher.Furthermore, the staff doesn't seem to want to be there, and try to make an absolute bare-minimum effort in terms
2083;The last time I was at the Yonge and Eglinton Pickle Barrel was this past spring. The experience was so horrendous that I've refused to go back there. My husband and I ordered our food, he ordered the steak and when it arrived his plate had a dirty paper receipt inside the food. When we told the waiter and he brought a new meal, they got the order wrong. When the bill arrived there was no discount or anything on it, we had to ask for the manager to even get 15% off. The manager had a bad attitude too, acted like it isn't his problem and like he couldn't understand why we were upset. While we were waiting for the manager to "rectify" the problem, we saw a waiter who brought back a salad to the kitchen to be redressed and another waitress was like "oh its ok, make him another, I'll take this one" and she took it to her table! I would expect it to be standard practice from both a customer service and hygienic point of view not to re-serve food to unsuspecting diners that was already rejected and sent back to
2084;terrible!!!food is terrible, bland, cheap in quality, & quality dropping constantly. service: geez. bunch of slobs with no customer service training we complained that 3 orders of chicken skewers were not the same as the skewers always ordered before, with onions & mushrooms, & they had no seasoning, were very dry & borderline burned. manager keeps smirking, dismissing me as this is how they always make them, he's worked here a whole year! Meanwhile my husbands family has been ordering there for 20 years.also, he was making comments that I'm not listening, meanwhile he's trying to dismiss everything I'm saying about my group being disappointed with the food, but he kept talking OVER me & talking in circles, I had to explain to him that I heard him every time he kept repeating himself. also, has to be said, excuse me, fat bitch at the front kept smirking & making smart-alec comments, & when I tried talking to her, she simply avoided looking at me, & kept grumbling under her breath. WHERE IS THE CUSTOMER
2085;Arrived after the lunch time rush, restaurant was about 30% full. Told the hostess that my time was limited. I was seated at a table that was covered in crumbs. The server was very pleasant and cleaned it quickly. She gave me a menu and I told her that I will order in a couple of minutes...15 minutes later the server was no where to be found so I spoke to another server asking her if I could order. She asked me who my server was and I thought she was going to find her. I then saw the hostess pass by and told her that I've been waiting to order and her answer was that the server was busy. Clearly I was not going to get service anytime soon. I decided to leave and on my way out I told the hostess that I was leaving. She didn't seem surprised and said sorry but the server was busy. I will never return!
2086;They've renovated this location so I was hoping the food had gotten better. Big mistake. I got sick after eating their calimari appetizer. Even their Rose Reisman dishes tasted awful. It's too bad because this location is so convenient next to the movie theatre. I don't know why it's always full of people. Everytime I eat here I get sick to my stomach. Unlike other Pickel Barrel locations.
2087;I could not believe the state of the washrooms on Thursday evening. I had to check every single stall before I found one that was near acceptable. There was exactly ONE semi clean washroom. I witnessed a lady bend down and pick up toilet paper scraps from the ground to use because there was zero toilet paper I'm the entire washroom. I'm so disgusted. Also took forever to get our bill. The food is mediocre. Nothing special.
2088;I hadn't been here in a while and decided to give it a try as I currently live in the area and was catching a movie in the same mall later on in the evening. Where do I begin? The inedible dry burger that came with a wilted, brown lettuce "wrap" or the stale tasting chicken wings we ordered as our appetizer? The waitress brought no condiments, did not refill our drinks even once, and when we did manage to flag her down to ask for condiments she seemed a) annoyed b) brought the wrong ones. All in all, bad to mediocre food and appalling service. Will not go back. With so many great options in the area, there is no reason to subject yourself to this place.
2089;I've been here a couple times and been disappointed each time. There is just nothing special about the food and it honestly isn't worth the price. So many better options in the neighborhood. One thing which I really didn't understand is how they choose to place you. I went when it was really empty once and yet they put me in one of the smallest boots possible.
2090;I just completed a review for the Pickle Barrel meal I had yesterday (spoilers: It was terrible) when I realized I was actually at another Pickle Barrel Location just last week, on Thursday.I didn't order food that time, however I did have drinks and our server seemed to completely forget about us. Both our waters and our alcoholic beverages were completely empty and we kept trying to flag down a different server - any server!! - without luck for the three hours we were there. As a result, I had only two drinks over that entire period, but with the week I'd had, I could have easily been convinced to have 3 or 5 drinks if a waiter had been nearby so I could place my orders!It was really surprising and disappointing. I've actually never had service that bad. We had to order our second round through a different server (or perhaps busser) who was just walking by. We didn't see our original server again until we flagged down the hostess to have someone bring us our cheque.
2091;We sat down for a couple of drinks and decided to order a plate of nachos. This plate came out half heated, and it was obvious. I asked the server to get us a BRAND new one and in less than two minutes, she brings me one which was evidently the same one they took back. She chose to lie to me and say they made a new one. Reason why? Because I chose to take a picture of the old one and it was the exact same. She took this back to her manager who after speak to her, took the plate and aggressively threw it onto the table adjacent to him in anger. In addition to all that, the next plate they brought out was absolutely terrible. Were they trying to get back at me for being upset at poorly made food? Worst part of it all is their corporate office doesn't have the decency to reach out and apologize and call for an explanation. They simply say 'we are sorry and will be retraining management.'Great? But who's going to call me and explain why that happened and apologize. Don't spend a dime here, worst service and
2092;Kay so Nancy C emailed me and copy pasta'd and called me "Sara S." instead of by my actual name which goes to show that these people really don't care whether or not its the disgusting, unhealthy, hazardous food their serving or their lack of customer service from their waiting staff. There is literally no point in going here other than to get sick and get automated emails of past emails they sent. Like who is Sara S. My name is no where near similar to that of Sara S.  That shows how much care Nancy C has for this business when she can't even edit out the name she used in her last email with the name of the person who theyre actually referring to. And just to let you know one of your managers came out and offered the refund and a replacement food but its like, if you cant fix your kitchen staff from months ago when people have been complaining since forever that your food sucks, what makes my one little encounter going to open their eyes now? There was nothig wrong with any of your staffs behaviour in fa
2093;It's too bad I have to give this place such a poor review because the food on their very abundant menu isn't half bad. Let me start by pointing out the positive first: The menu has just about anything you can think of. Whatever you're in the mood for will most likely be listed. The ambiance is nice enough nice seating, nice lighting, etc, etc. The price is right and they have a great drink and dessert selection. So what's the problem?...Well, you know how the Jackson 5 said one bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch?...Unfortunately, the service at this Yonge and Eglinton location just spoiled the entire silo...  Sigh... I probably won't ever go back to this location again after what happened and here's why:  I was there for dinner and drinks and from the start it didn't feel right. Our waitress took forever to greet us and the place wasn't even busy...No smile, no name, no connection at all from our server and first impressions usually mean a lot...even still, I was able to let it slide until I asked 
2094;Service was inadequate and slow. BBQ chicken was dry and tasteless. I'm from Texas -- I know BBQ and that was awful. "Mixed vegetables" was 1/4 of a corn on the cob, half of a bell pepper and three asparagus.  Woopie.....! Didn't get your money's worth. Don't come here, just don't.
2095;Cheap ingredients, lake of taste, nothing attractive in this place. Go at your own risks.
2096;Well this was a disappointment!   More like "Ickle" Barrel than Pickle Barrel!We have had some good evening and lunch meals in the past at this location.We really enjoyed when Rose Reisman re-did the menu.Those days are gone!On this occasion we went for brunch/breakfast before a movie matinee.We both ordered the standard breakfast (3 eggs with very crispy bacon).  We had a choice of potatoes or latkes (we both ordered latkes) and toast.Frankly - it was awful -- I can say without a doubt that it was the worst restaurant breakfast I have ever had in all my 15 years in Toronto.I ordered tea - and they brought me a pot of hot water.  When i went to put the tea bag in, there were paper strips from some other food floating in it.I told the waitress and she replaced it and apologized (but yuk!!)I wonder if she even brought a new pot.  Goodness knows where that stuff came from.Then the meal came - what a disappointment - 3 eggs swimming in water -- odd for over easy (utterly tasteless and undercooked -
2097;40 years in business and lost their way.  Pickle Barrel is a strange place, originally an up market deli, they have forgotten what deli food and portions are and try to pump out sort of nouveau-neo-healthy-cusine that also misses the mark. Latkas that look like hockey pucks, deli sandwiches that look anemic are all served out by a staff that wouldn't know deli if they walked into one and don't give a damn about the customer. I would suggest that Rose Reisman go to Thornhill, Montreal or New York and see what deli is and then try again.
2098;I visited this past weekend, the service was extremely slow. The server passed us numerous times without even asking if we needed anything. Took 40 minutes until she came. I ordered the steak frites. She gave me my Cesar salad to start and when I was about to put my fork in my salad there was a huge bug laying there. I had to flag the waitress to let her know she didn't seem shocked she didn't apologize she just took it and walked away. Came back with my Cesar salad without the crotons and I had to ask for them she brought it . I had ordered my steak medium well and it came burnt and dry. When it was time to pay she charged me for my meal and I told her I wouldnt be paying for it I would like to speak to the manager . The manager came all nonchalant and guaranteed they cut their lettuce fresh and they will take it off my bill. I do not recommend coming here, customer service is terrible and the food isn't great either .
2099;Went here two Fridays ago for an early dinner. Food was terrible and dried up. Service was slow, really really slow. The funny thing is that the restaurant was a mess but no one seemed worried about fixing it. Called the manager over who also didn't seem worried or like she wanted to fix anything. Didn't give a good reason why anything was so bad and just said to go and she would comp everything. What a disgrace, I left shaking with rage.It's been many months since I wrote this review and they have yet to write back to me. Very disrespectful, I'm astonished a corporate place could do this to people. Going to deter anyone to go here to avoid such awful treatment and food. You should be ashamed of yourself and your company!
2100;My wife and our friends have been supporting the Pickle Barrel at Centerpoint for 17 years and over the past two of those years(since the renovation)things have been going downhill. Wait staff are terrific as always. There is a snarky/rude female manager however.Three of us were there this morning and we  were less than impressed. We wanted to order breakfast from the regular menu and were told that we could not because it was a "Holiday"! What?? It's Fathers Day, not a Holiday. The plates were old and dingy with wear and so large that the food looked lonely. What is going on in that kitchen? There is no consistency from one visit to the next. The Great Reuben sandwich is far from great. Skimpy on the meat, only a handful of fries, the dill pickle had seen better days and the slaw was tired an limp. Pull up your socks Pickle Barrel. Get that kitchen in order, straighten out your managers attitude and stop trying to force your customers to use a special higher priced menu with some lame invention of a Holida
2101;Had some takeout here on this snowy evening. I forgot how bland this food is. I got the 3 cheese gnocchi and while it's very soft there's not much flavor to it even with the goat cheese stuffed inside. Since moxies got rid of their avocado spring rolls I decided to get the avocado egg rolls from here. The sauce is too strong with it and sweet. The egg rolls were way too overcooked and it was painful to chew on my teeth. The filing inside wasn't too bad. I thought maybe it would have redeemed itself after not eating here so long. This will be the last time I'll be getting food from here. I think you're best bet is to just get a wrap or something from here. I've been to 4 locations of the pickle barrel and they all have proven to be a disappointment.
2102;After sifting through the book-like menu I ordered the "Best Ever" Meatloaf.  The gravy is an odd mix of salt, sugar and a dash of beef flavor sort of like the flavour of those fries and gravy chips you sometimes see.  If I were lost in the woods for days before coming by this place, I'd probably just eat one of the servers.  The service was quick.
2103;I've been to this Pickle Barrel plenty of times. Each visit was very disappointing. Pickle Barrel has terrible service the staff looks like they really don't want to be there at all. The reasonable priced food that tastes good is served with dirty cutlery that has food on them. You can't enjoy anything! When you bring the problem to the attention of the servers, they don't seem to comprehend the problem, or completely ignore the matter. Many times I was given a new set of cutlery to use, which also had food on it. I really tried to like this place, hoping that perhaps it would clean up its act because the food is good. It's too bad the service and the cleanliness suck.
2104;Never again. Menu is way too big (to be fair at least they do have vegetarian options), but the food is so bland. Tastes like a bad at-home-meal. Service is also slow and there's usually a wait too...don't really see why. The layout of the restaurant is interesting, but kind of confusing....feels a bit like a maze. Food from their take out section is just as bad too. Baked goods are dry and just plain icky.
2105;Was at this location Sumday Sept 25th, 2016 (5:00pm) Food was wonderful but the service was absolutely horrible. Took 20min for our witress to come to our table and when she did it was like we where inconveniencing her, she dropped off our appetizers and didn't take our dinner order, waited 25 min for her to come back completely ignored us the whole time. Caller the manager over and she was even rudder then the witress as I'm telling her about all this all she can do is make up excuses for the witress. We didn't get an apology or anything from the manager or the witress. Never have I had such horrible service at this location.. I definitely will be contacting there head office and reporting this manager and witress
2106;This was my first time at Pickle Barrel and the service was awful. The server came to our table after 15 minutes of waiting, though the restaurant was not busy. So we put our order for drinks and food at the same time. The food was served after waiting another 20 minutes and drinks came even 5 minutes after that! The server never apologized for delay or never asked if everything was ok. We had ordered Kali Chicken Grilled Cheese Sandwich and Maple Nut Salmon and beer (Stella) for drink, no fancy cocktail that may take forever to make. The food was ok, nothing great. We will never visit this place again.
2107;WARNING  Stay Clear from this place. Unless your are looking for bad food and service.
2108;Food tasted like it's been hanging around for days. Fast service but feels like you are being rushed out of the empty restaurant.  Not a lot of options for the cost.
2109;The food is not that good,  don't have a lot of option, when I get there and get to see the food it was pretty dry. It makes me think how long is that food been there. Delivery food was better then the buffet I guess because they cooked fresh. And for the price if I want to pay a little little bit more I can go to mandarin where I have more option to choose. I just thought I'll give this place a try. But, ya 1 visit is enough to judge it. The service is okay nothing that will make me wants to come back. Sad coz it's so close to my place.
2110;We used to go here all the time. It's a buffet, reasonable prices. We stopped going (forever) because we found hair in our food... Not just a little hair... A lot. I'll never return.
2111;Food was never that good but they had a wonderful server named Joyce who had us coming every other week. Now we go twice a year at most. Hire back Joyce (and mix up the buffet dishes once in a while) and we'll come back
2112;Dont know if the last reviewer has eaten Asian food prior to their review but to me this is just Manchu Wok in its own store. Its basically a fast food hakka style food and the food itself isnt any much better from what you would find in a typical mall food court. Unlike other Hakka style restaurants the food is not prepared fresh but is sitting in a warming tray waiting to be scooped up. Sorry but I came here looking for real Asian food not fast food with a fortune cookie.
2113;Ordered delivery here now twice. Food is great if you like your Chinese food BLAND and WET. Ugh. Just disgusting. We ordered a variety of dishes, including staples like hot and sour soup (literally tasteless, was like a bowl of snot. Without the salt.) Hakka chicken (tasted like a brown paper bag dipped into a puddle on the road), Manchurian fried rice (I think they cooked it in a wok made from 30 day old salmon), etcI gave them a second chance by holy hell that was probably the worst delivery order I've ever received anywhere. Disgusting. Bland. Off-putting. AVOID.
2114;I was in the mood to eat Chinese food since I was close to this store I decided to give it a try. From reading all the reviews, I can understand why this place has low ratings. When I walked in there was no customer in site. It was completely a ghost town. Despite that I still continued to walk in and get what I wanted to eat. There was no food in the servery. So I asked the girl that was at the front what I can order, she showed me a menu that literally just had 5 choices and said this is the menu. After looking at it, I just walked out. I didn't try the food but from the reviews and the service I received I'm glad I didn't.
2115;Disgusting place I'll never come here again. The burger I was served was cold and tastes so bad I had to throw my only lunch. i am never eating at wendys again. I cant get the cold taste of bacon out of my mouth and beef doesn't even look normal. Sub par food with a expensive menu. I hope they go out of business and something better will take over.
2116;Stopped in today to try the waffle cone Frosty (just a cone really) but it cost $1.89 and was tiny, plus the ice cream was dripping (melting) as soon as I got it.For the price, I was expecting more, it was a rip off.
2117;I went in it since it had a sign saying "under new management"there is a metal ramp as you enter the door and it looks dirtyhave no desire to go back
2118;Would give this place zero stars if I could. The cup they gave me to get my soda with had a cockroach in it. Totally disgusted. Never again!
2119;crap service...subpar food, all of the tv's were set on boxing...? bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a bit Not impressed
2120;Let's start by saying I'm not in the business of taking enjoyment with leaving negative reviews but people should really be warned about this particular location (Lake Shore/ Cawthra) - don't waste your hard-earned money.A few Friday nights ago, we ordered about six pounds (separate flavours) of wings for carryout.  My husband gave them his AMEX number over the phone. When he arrived, he was told that they actually don't accept AMEX albeit the fact that they still took the number over the phone.  He didn't have his debit card with him so he had to go to across to Metro and buy a VISA gift card to pay the hefty $78 bill.When he brought the wings home, they were a mess and none of the orders were labelled.  Some looked like a bunch of salad dressing was poured over them.  We tried to eat them but we couldn't figure out what flavour was which and, plus, a lot of them were undercooked.He called to speak to the manager who said, unless requested, it's not their policy to mark the orders.  They also weren't 
2121;Miserable atmosphere. Horrible service. Crappy food. My waitress is making my wings. I'll never ever be back. One star is too much.
2122;As per the review below I too experienced one of the worst services at this Wild Wing establishment and cannot believe that after almost a year, an important area such as customer service has yet to be corrected at this place. A party of 4 we went in on a UFC night, at approx. 7pm (the fights would not begin until 10pm). We sat upstairs where there was 1 bartender and 2 waitresses. There was about 4 tables with people. We placed our order, 4 orders of chicken wings and a deep fried pickle appetizer. The deep fried pickle came out in reasonable time. The wings however took approximately an hour to receive our wings. One of the dishes was cold but we were unable to tell the waitress because she never returned to our table. After eating and waiting another 30 mins for her to return so we could get our bill, we had to go up to the bar to request our bill. In my view this staff was too busy preparing for a UFC event instead of taking care of their customers. Such a disappointment and I do not recommend this place
2123;worst service I've ever had as far as i can remember. Waitress all alone at the floor, doubling as bartender, taking orders, handling the payments. Not sure whose fault it was that it turned out that way it but at least be apologetic when a room full of people have been waiting an hour for 2 orders of chicken wings. Also please warn customers that service is going to suck due to the conditions. I was hoping another member of staff was going to suddenly enter and save the day. It was painful. Partly my fault that I didn't figure this out when I entered and should have left early, but I was hungry!The wings finally came and they weren't bad. Although, after an hour of waiting with the stomach grumbling, probably anything edible would have been good.
2124;Service was horrible! Some European lady with an accent came to take our order and right in the middle of my order she walked away and helped someone else! I called her back to ask her if we could finish our order. She rudely complied.. I was sitting on the far left of the bar and I could clearly see the kitchen. The server was sitting on a keg taking off her shoes and picking dirt from in between her toes.. I then saw her place carrots and celery with her dirty foot fingers into our plates! DISGUSTING! Food was alright. Will not be coming here again I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE
2125;I love Wild Wing... and I have raved about every other location on Yelp. This dingy little thing on Lakeshore? Not so much. Sadly, I wasn't even craving wings when we walked in. And when I ordered my regular Saddle Up, I did not love it. First things first, this location is such a Ghost town. When we walked in, it was totally empty, lacked the usual decor, and the usual amped up music. Instead, some TVs playing sports, one quintessential old guy at the bar, flirting with the one waitress/bartender half his age. The menu looked dreary and different too. Saddle Up (my order) is usually described as Gar Par and Buttermilk Dill at the other locations. It was Caesar and Dill at this one. The waitress had me convinced that these are exactly the same. NO, they aren't. Caesar and Dill is exactly what it is - Caesar salad dressing with some dill. No taste of buttermilk, no taste of parmesan. The fries are forced in... so you end up paying $15 for the 10 wings whether you want fries or not. Never coming back to thi
2126;So we went here to watch UFC and eat because we were starving. There were no seats or tables so we decided to just drink and watch tv and starve because there was nothing to eat on. Spoke to 3 different workers and NOBODY told us there was a $20 minimum per person. The boss made it seem like we could just stand and watch UFC and chill like everyone else no problem! But we decided to be nice and order beer for us 4. Came out to about $52. And now they were closing so wrapping us up she asked if I wanted to round it to $80. At first I was like "excuse me?". She explains the $20 minimum fee and I said "nobody mentioned anything like that to us." She told me it was in their sign at front (which by the way is only seen when u EXIT the restaurant). So we starved, didn't even have a TABLE and they want to charge us $80? Are you kidding me? We ended up paying but never am I coming back to this. If we actually sat down and got to USE their restaurant I 100% agree with the $20 fee...but if we are forced to stand around
2127;Nasty sushi that tastes like the garbage you can buy pre-made at the supermarket. The simulated crab was the biggest turn off.
2128;Delivered on time (40 minutes) The sushis were not that good, the rice seemed not really fresh, hard actually... The salad was... cheap and nothing to get excited about the soup that came with all that either. First and last time here
2129;1 hour 45 minutes for delivery.  Unfortunately, I am unable to comment on the quality due to the extremely poor service (no explanation/apology/offer to compensate either). I have previously read about their terrible delivery times, but I'll give most places a chance. I will not be giving "I Love Sushi" a 2nd chance. Even for Etobicoke / Japanese restaurants, this is unnaceptable.
2130;I'm sad to say I hated it, ate 2 sushi and little else.  I ordered a chicken udon, a combo sushi and a specialty - they forgot one sushi, not that it mattered -- everything was essentially inedible.  Udon was greasy, with little taste and slimy looking, the sushi was grey and had a weird flavor.  I was hoping for the best but spent $50 including tip, for hoping I wouldn't be ill.
2131;I would give zero if possible. I read through all the reviews and the negative ones describe my experience to the T. Terrible food, terrible service, sticky tables, weirdly limited menu unless you get all you can eat. Avoid this place at all costs. I can't believe it's been in business so long.If you are looking at this review and wondering if I'm just picky - look at my stats. This is the first place I've ever awarded ONE star to. Don't forget, I would have given it ZERO if possible.
2132;MOST HORRIBLE RESTAURANT EVER. WOULD HAVE GIVEN 0 STAR IF POSSIBLE.I ordered a delivery. Food came relatively fast, so I was happy...until I saw how pathetic it was. For $18, I got an unagi don with 6 small pieces of unagi and barely any teriyaki sauce. The rice portion was huge, but tasted horrid. My advice, if you want good yet cheap (1/2 the price in I Love Sushi) unagi don, head for Aji Sai just 300m away.
2133;Downright disgusting.It's challenging to imagine that anyone could be in business at this revolting level. Fish was soggy and beyond prime, rice was a watery mess, 'tempura' was a burnt crispy hell of grease. When I called to complain the "manager" who wouldn't give his name hung up.BEWARE - this is the bottom of the barrel and went into the trash where it belongs.
2134;after this experience i will only treat Just Eat's 6-star rating system as cute decor for the menu page. their reviews for this restaurant did not mention how whacky the food this place has to order. if there was a horror sushi contest, i love sushi would win first place no doubt.the second our order arrived i thought the delivery guy looked kind of guilty. i didn't understand why until we opened the food & it looked like they just scraped together other people's left-overs at the resto & made it our lunch. the salads were almost rotting. and warm. the salmon teriyaki was the main character in this horror movie but it died before making on screen. rice was hard, they didn't bother heating up the old rice. i love miso soup no matter where i go but for the first time i hate the sour taste of the soup this place brings. the cali rolls were out this world, never seen anything like it before, i had to spit it out to inspect what was in there. the sushi? they did this thing where they put a little paste of wasabi
2135;Was looking for AYCE sushi so we just popped in without checking Yelp/reviews. Wasn't a wise move. Sushi was pretty average, they didn't bring out a bunch of what we ordered. The server seemed a bit too keen on rushing our orders, which made no sense as the place was empty otherwise.
2136;So disappointed!!! I have to say. Tempura was over cooked and sashimi was not fresh! The service there make us really uncomfortable!!! The waitress warning us that if we can't finish the dishes, they will charge us 50 cents per "piece" when we are still eating! That's really bad! The table was sticky, the food was terrible. And what I need to mention they charge everything even one piece of chicken you can't eat in a buffet. What a terrible experience of eating! What a terrible business. I have to say I have never met such a restaurant like this.
2137;Will never buy again. Read the reviews only after ordering, food is disgusting, so is the service. Couldnt eat it, my dog couldnt eat it! What a waste of 60 bucks
2138;The restaurant looks old, the service was really bad, the girl even served us salmon without soya sauce, everything tastes like leftover. My friend said it just because i read the reviews and i was obsessed with those, but no, it was actually the worst sushi i have ever had. When my friend was paying he was about to pay $2 for tips despite the fact that everything was so bad, but no option for "amount", just by percent, 15, 25 or 30% in total. Such a horrible place, i dont want to be mean, but sometimes we cant get what we pay especially in this case. If i can rate it 0 star, i would love to do it.
2139;If you don't want to read long reviews, just trust me and don't try this place. Seriously. I ordered sushi for delivery. I got a teriyaki chicken & some assorted sushi. I was notified that my food was on its way ..... 30 minutes AFTER the expected delivery time. It was completely unreasonable. When they finally did arrive, the driver called to tell me he was outside. I opened my front door, and they were parked outside my house. There were two people in the car, both staring at me. Eventually the driver waved me over. I was wearing boxers and it was January, and I sure as hell wasn't going to pick up my own food from their car. I stood there for about 3-4 minutes until the passenger finally got out, STORMED up the steps and very rudely shoved the food into my hands. I wish I was exaggerating. Unfortunately, I had tipped the driver in advance. The food was awful. The sushi was mediocre but the teriyaki was inedible. Horrible. Don't waste your money.
2140;So I ignored all the bad delivery reviews, because this place is near my office and though I'd go eat in. I don't often say stay away - but stay away from this place. The seaweed salad was tough, and parts of it were frozen. Yuck. The tuna sushi had actually gone bad - had this mushy, glue-like texture and a funky taste. Had to spit it out. When I told the waitress she giggled and said she'd never tried it. I tried to explain that it was actually bad, as in rotten, and she just walked away. Gross.
2141;Ordered 3 rolls online and was given only 2 tiny packets of soya sauce, when I called to have more delivered, they insisted I was given 4 packets , basically saying I was lying about Soya Sauce lol! The lady got rude when I was being so polite, then the phone was passed to some guy that spoke better English, and he was only able to send me 4 , and that it would take an hour to get the damn sauce lol. Apparently I needed to buy extra soya sauce to even get the correct amount lol, there are so many sushi places that deliver, definitely will never order from this one again. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!! BEWARE!!!!!!!
2142;HORRIBLE. Ordered delivery while I was at work, worse experience of my life. I gave them one star because they did come on time. Whe to begin.... Well, first off, after placing the order the lady on the phone could not even tell me how much the total was. Her exact words were "it's $113 or $130 not sure." Then hung up. The food was disgusting, everything had WAY too much sugar in it. The order was missing food. I called back telling them and to bring more spicey mayo and soy sauce since they didnt give us much to begin with. The lady tells us she will bring the food but there is an extra charge for the spicey mayo. This place also refused to give me the receipt for the order when I asked for it twice!!! NEVER AGAIN Am I going anywhere near this place.
2143;This place has THE worst sushi, I've ever tasted in my entire life.  Not only is the service horrendous, the food is an abomination.  The sushi was oily and it wasn't even a fried roll.  Barf. Never again. I think I'd rather eat dog food.
2144;Nothing to love about the food. Would give it minus 3 stars, but rating system doesn't allow it.  The food is NOT fresh and utterly disgusting.  I ordered takeout so cant comment about the restaurant, but if the food is any reflection of the quality and cleanliness of the place, it cant be good. THE worst sushi i have had. Stay away.
2145;this place is so so awfulnever ever eat hereI thought I was going to throw up not because of how full I was for AYCE but because of how nasty the rolls were. The only reason I finished was because they charged .50 cents per roll. I ordered a green dragon roll which is pretty normal among sushi places and it always comes with fresh salmon this place stuffed the whole roll with fake crab and a bit of rotting avocado on the top.I'm just waiting for the food poisoning to hit medon't do it!!!
2146;These people do not love sushi. Ordered delivery. Took 1.5 hours. It arrived cold. They told me 40 minutes. The free soup was good. The free salad was edible. Everything else was the worst I've ever eaten. Really really bad. Yikes!
2147;MY PREVIOUS REVIEW WAS DELETED because I wanted everyone to be aware- DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE. People who work here are RUDE, unhelpful, and do not know anything about running a business or making a customer happy.They IGNORED SEVERE  ALLERGY requests, yelled at us and told me I was to blame, kept passing the phone around to different employees who yelled "WHAT YOU WANT?!" and pretending not to speak any English, all to avoid having the proper items sent. After everything they even refused to give us our money back. Disgusting.Save your time, save your money, order from ANYWHERE ELSE. This will most likely get deleted again, but I will be back again.
2148;Don't complain ever about restos or food but this is an honorable mention for the disgusting sushi I had delivered. Most of what I ordered was raw fish, so it all came spoiled. If you can't deliver food in quality just call and say you can't serve it. It's better than getting someone sick.
2149;Honestly, this is the worst sushi I've ever had :( And sushi is my absolute favourite food ever and I've had a LOT of different sushi from Toronto restaurants and beyond. I can honestly say I was disgusted. It's awful tasting, tastes super old, and even the dynamite roll was AWFUL. Dynamite is myfavourite, I've never went to a place that messed up a simple dynamite roll. I have no idea why this place is still serving food... it surely can't be good for you when it's that far from fresh. PS - I am NOT picky about sushi because I love it all, but this place is absolutely gross. The service was ok and they were very nice but please don't waste your money on such awful food ugh literally worst I've ever had.
2150;A full half hour late really made me wish I hadn't tipped the driver ahead of time using Just Eat. The driver didn't even read the instructions I sent which stated EXACTLY where my front door was. Instead, he knocked on the window, which is nowhere near my door and on the exact opposite side of the house. When I called to let the restaurant know their delivery was already ten minutes late, they shut me up by saying yes, yes, it's on its way. Thanks for the reassurance and specificity. When we finally got the food, it was extremely disappointing. The tiny, tiny salmon rolls were not worth $5, and the soup was too salty. The salad was warm and soggy, probably a result of being driven around Toronto for over an hour. I don't care how desperate I am for sushi, I am never ordering from this place again. I'd rather walk the hour and fifteen minutes it took for the sushi to arrive to get to a GOOD sushi restaurant.
2151;I Love Sushi*  I had the Spicy Salmon and Spicy ScallopSimply AwfulPoor quality which resembles convenience store quality sushiFeels like they used Jasmine rice for the Maki roll based on the color and textureSesame seeds were not integrated well into the rollsSpicy level was decent but not clear which sauce product they used.  Certainly was packaged and not made fresh in houseScallop & Salmon portion was and size of the roll was based on rice volumeWould not order againFor a high quality Maki roll, refer to Yuzu Sushi!
2152;I don't usually write reviews on restaurants, but this sushi place is ridiculously terribly unbearably disgusting. It took 1.5 hour to arrive even though I live in dt. When I first open the box, I thought there were a lot of sashimi. Then, I realized more than half of the "sashimi" were actually raw tomatoes. The salmon sashimi is WARM and HALF-COOKED and TERRIBLY STALE. The crab meat in California roll that they give for free is also stale. I highly doubt they made it spicy just to cover up the staleness. I will never ever get food from here anymore.
2153;I know you're supposed to get what you pay for but this is a whole new level. They actually used canned tuna in one of their rolls
2154;Just came back from ordering Pad Thai from this place and its god awful. I'll never come back here not only was the the Noodles not actual Pad Thai it lacked flavour and the noodles weren't actual vermicelli noodles.
2155;The staff on duty when I went there for dinner were very attentive. I didn't go very long without a full cup of tea and the food came out quickly. I do wish that they spent a  little more time focusing on the preparation as the dishes we got were subpar. The sushi chefs do not appear to have received any formal training in any aspect of sushi making. I'm by no means an expert but damn, it looked like they just threw together whatever was within reach and wrapped it in nori. The soup noodles were greasy for some reason, and everything that came off the grill was swimming in teriyaki sauce. I don't expect perfection. I mean this is an AYCE joint after all, but the quality of the food and the skill of the chefs is borderline embarrassing.  It almost seems that the  owners either don't know or don't care to offer anything more than the absolute minimum. This place needs to shut down for a few weeks and train their staff on the basics. If that doesn't work then call it quits.
2156;ordered food from here off justeat. not only was my food horrid: soggy, poorly made rolls drowning in some kind of sauce but i also overpaid, a lot. the quality of fish was subpar. definitely not worth it. the food smelled weird too, will not order from here again. AVOID AVOID
2157;Ordered delivery.. Took an hour .. I ordered a 26 piece combo and in that combo I got four pieces of artificial crab STICK on rice.Then the driver tried to rip me off an extra ten dollars .. Would never order or even consider dining in.
2158;I come here very rarely because the lunch specials are notably cheaper. But this visit will be my LAST. Every experience I've had I've dealt with really bad costumer service from all employees. Today we had sat down to eat and the women working barely acknowledged us, forgot half of the things to bring out. Yelled over our heads as another costumers came in. Then at the end of our meal she decided to tell us that the interact machine was not currently working and had my sister run out to the nearest atm.Very unprofessional. The food is OK not the best of cheaper sushis I've had. Not somewhere I recommended to anyone and definitely will NOT be returning.
2159;I never complain about food.  This was garbage, literally.  I threw most of my $47.47 in the garbage, and what's in my stomach now doesn't feel too good.  Took an hour and 45 minutes after calling at the hour mark to see if they'd received my order through grubcanada.com.  Soup, tempura, salmon teriyaki: cold.  Sushi and salad: near cooked.  I'm keeping the menu in my drawer with the others except this one has the words "never again!!!" written on it.
2160;I wish I had better things to say, but I went against my better judgment and ignored all the reviews on Yelp and ordered from I love Sushi.  It was not good at all. I've eaten a lot of bad sushi in my time, and this was bad -- not fresh and poorly produced. Pay attention to the law of averages with the reviews in this case, as they speak the truth. The staff was really nice, so posting this in hopes they review and reevaluate their standards, because I remember it used to be pretty decent, so maybe they can make a comeback.
2161;If I could give this restaurant no stars and still submit this review through I would. This place serves cat food quality sushi. By that I mean they make their "spicy tuna rolls" out of canned tuna.You get what you pay for here. Don't be fooled by the cheap prices or the fact there is a coupon for them in the Entertainment book (that's why my friend and I got suckered in).To top things off the service was horrible. The waitress had an awful attitude.. she never checked on our table we had to walk up to the counter to ask for water and the bill. I guess the service went well with the cat food.
2162;I can only give zero stars because I didn't even get to eat. After waiting in line to place my drive through order I was told when I got to the window that they could not accept my gift card. Apparently they installed some new computer system that would not allow them to process gift cards. No sign at the drive through menu board, and I wasn't asked how I would be paying. They wasted my time and then made their problem mine when I tried to pay with one of their gift cards. Since I didn't have an extra $50 for dinner with me i ended up having to leave with no food! I know I can't be the only person who was given a gift card for Christmas- I'm sure there are tons of them in the area. This location needs to get its act together and figure out how to deal with this issue properly without punishing their customers.
2163;I went in here with my friend back in the winter after having dinner at Anatolia as she wanted to order some curry and roti for her husband. The owner was quite chatty and seemed passionate about the food so I made note to eventually try it. Plus, my friend did indicate that, although her husband didn't want it, her son ate it and liked it. In fact, she had gone back maybe once or twice to pick it up again.Anyway, one day I found myself craving jerk pork and Mitzie's was closed so what the heck, I'll try it as it's only "advertised" as $4.99. When I walked in, there were no other patrons in there. There was a big shoulder of jerk pork sitting in a warming area that looked like it was grilled with the bark so I was excited as I thought that's what I would be getting. I ordered the jerk pork with peas and rice. He brought out this teensy, weensy Styrofoam container that most restaurants would use for side salad. After he dished out the rice, he started to add gravy, which I thought was the oxtail gravy. Then 
2164;I went there 3 times.. I most said the food is ok ..nothing to big about .I had better tropical food
2165;First of all, I noticed the little typo in the restaurant's name. Miss Natalie's Topical C sounds like a medicinal ointment, lol! For the record, it is Miss Natalie's Tropical Cuisine.On to the review.....sadly, I didn't have a positive experience with my first take-out here. Having had a long day, skipping lunch at work, and such a dreary rainy day, I was looking forward to a nice 'tropical' dinner that would wake up my taste buds. I ordered the oxtail, rice and peas, and a side of fried plantains. When I got home, I was dismayed to find that my plantains were blackened and soggy.  I suspect that this was fried earlier in the day and refried again, sooo definitely not fresh.  My oxtail and rice had no heat or spice, you'd think I walked home with the food container exposed to the rain, because that's how it tasted, washed out.
2166;Let me begin by saying: I was so excited for this curry and roti joint to open. I am a lover of all things tropical, especially the food.I walked in and thought that maybe they were not officially open. There was sign-age laying around and only half the space was furnished. At the counter, they had trays for food to be displayed, but it was empty, safe for a couple of plastic bags with what looked like bread sticks  in them.I was willing to give them a chance though.  It takes a long time to move in and get cozy,  right?I go to the counter and read the menu. Not knowing what I want, I asked who I can only assume was Miss Natalie what was good. "Everything," was the reply.  I told her I understand that you like it all,  but what is the best? "Everything,  it depends on what you like." I like everything. So I told her, but she still was unable to make a recommendation. I told her I was shocked she could not help me.Frustrated (she couldn't just say jerk chicken?) I asked to speak to the chef (that's how
2167;Worst service I've ever had at a restaurant, fast food or otherwise. The staff were both surly and indifferent. It was dinner time and they had run out of both guacamole and salsa. No apologies, but lots of anger at management - but taking it out on the customers. Not cool.
2168;Do you enjoy waiting 20min for the worst burrito of your life? Well boy do I have news for you! So, it's a burrito place in an airport, wasn't expecting 5 stars. Two people working, one person takes your order and then another puts the cold toppings on and panini presses it. Girl taking the order takes 5 people's orders then makes the hot portion of the burritos. Problem here is she works at a snails pace, goes into the back for minutes at a time and forgets what she went back for. I grabbed a soda when I was 4 people away from the register and by the time I got my burrito the soda was warm. Nothing here is remotely Mexican in flavor. I asked for hot sauce and got frank's hot sauce smothered all over it. They have guac on the menu but they didn't have it, same for jalapeños. This place was straight up nasty, slow and not worth the time wasted.
2169;DO NOT GO HERE!!!!Seriously gross. I am not a food snob and I truly enjoy some good cheap comfort food once in a while. However, this food was barely edible. I would really be surprised to learn if they even had a real kitchen back there. Everything from the soup to the spaghetti tasted like it was out of a can. The tomato soup tasted like alphagetti sauce. I ordered the spaghettini and meatballs - the noodles were extremely overcooked and mushy. The sauce tasted very similar to the tomato soup - like a can of globby alphagetti. The "meatballs" were the consistency of the weird meat you get at Subway (nothing against Subway) - very spongy in texture. Not what you expect when you order meatballs at an Italian restaurant, even if it is a family friendly one.I came here with my family because we were tempted by the "buy one meal and get one free" deal. DO NOT make the same mistake we did. Our "meals" were thrown out because they were unedible. I ordered a penne primavera to take home - it was a few plain noo
2170;Fast courteous service.  Nice menu.Taste was alright.Terrible food poisoning 10 hours later!I never get food poisoning but if you MUST go here please avoid their salad-chicken combos!
2171;Came in on family day, hoping to sit down for a nice family dinner. We're regular patrons of this restaurant and our kids love the food here. Kids wanted to get some spaghetti and meatballs. Waiter informed us they ran out of meat sauce. Kids wanted soup with their meal, ran out of tomato soup. My daughter wanted to get Italian wedding , they're were out but after waiter came back, they managed to get a pot going and got  another somehow. And no Coke! Seriously?  How? It's a syrup.  It seems to me that there's a significant issue with management in respect to anticipating demand during valentines and family day. If they know they'll run out of certain items, management needs to do everything they can to make sure they can handle dinner service. Call your suppliers and get it done. It is embarrassing that they won't even give my son a side of fries instead  of soup. Management will not allow. What the heck is going on? Are they purposely trying to prevent customers from coming back?  We haven't gotten the mai
2172;I love East Side Mario's but this location was the worst...restaurant I have ever been to!! The host was a bit eccentric but that wasn't the issue until I told him that we were ready to order, after being seated for 15 minutes with no one to check on us. He freaked out a little and said he doesn't take any orders and that our server would be with us very shortly. Another 5-10 minutes passed, I stopped another server and asked for our server because we were ready to order. Few mins later she came by with bread told us our server was still busy (for the past 30+ minutes) and ONLY took our drink orders. My friend and I chatted some more finished, we finished bread and another 10+ minutes passed...we still haven't gotten our drinks or our server.  At this point we've waited for over 40 minutes and we decided to leave. The shittiest part was we watched 2 tables that came after us got serviced before we did. Don't recommend this location, will never go back! And I work in food and beverage lol!
2173;The service here sucks! It took over 10 mins for the server to take our drinks. Once arrived, she was not very nice. The hostess was clueless about the menu. The food was okay but the server was slow, she screwed up our order and messed up the receipt. A lunch for five took over 30 mins to get salad and soup another ten mins to get food and about 20 mins to pay the bill. This place is a cluster****.
2174;I've been here before and the service and food wasn't bad, but the second time was terrible. Our group of four waited for about 15-20 minutes to actually get the attention of the hostess. After about another 20 minutes, we still weren't seated yet, even when the restaurant was pretty empty. Tables weren't being cleared fast enough. There simply weren't enough servers. The service has definitely gone downhill.We walked out and found another restaurant. I would not come here again.
2175;I went there for a late dinner and we wanted to sit at a booth in the dining area but my friend wanted one of the specials you can only get at the bar.  I don't like that you can only get certain specials if you sit by the bar, especially when the place is some what empty, they should allow you those specials anywhere you sit.  It's a pretty ugly atmosphere, dark and boring.  My friend and I sat at a high table close to the bar, and at that end they had a cart for dirty dishes sitting just across from us, gross!  but just wait it get's worse... I ordered the bacon wrapped scallop pasta with salad and garlic bread, and my friend ordered the pizza special.  Her pizza was dried out and nasty, and one of my bacon wrapped scallops had a hair wrapped into it. YUM YUM, I love eating other people's hair!  the pasta with my dish was pretty bland and boring.  The salad that came with my dish was a ceasar with way too much dressing and when I asked for less on the next one they gave me none, also when the waitress b
2176;Service here is the worst. Once we were seated no server came by at all and 20 mins already passed. The restaurant was pretty dead. A group of people then sat down in front of us and the waiter acknowledged them then walked right passed us. We had to stop her just to get her attention and at that point she just said I'll help you out but then walked away again. We just left after and ate somewhere else.
2177;Came here with my family for Victoria's day. It took a few minutes to get seated even though there were numerous tables empty but we brushed that off because it seemed like they didn't have a hostess/host at the moment to greet and seat us.When we were seated, we ordered our food but ended up getting our food before our drinks. We had to ask three times for our waters. Usually at a restaurant, drinks should come out first so that was the first red flag.When our pastas arrived, they were overly oily and the pasta was overcooked. It was also soggy. The food was rather disappointing as well as the service. This location was really dusty and dirty.Overall, my family and I most likely won't be returning to this location. The location in Brampton at Trinity Commons is the one we usually frequent and it is so much better.
2178;We came there in August, the AC was busted, we were seated in a corner, the place was full of clutter. there was dust everywhere. It was so hot and uncomfortable. We asked for some water to start off with, it came 10 mins later and looked dirty, had something floating there. We just stood up and left. I really liked the Pickering location, this one was awful. Sad.
2179;Service is awful! Was seated for 15 minutes and had to write my own order. 20 minutes later only served bread and water. Never coming back!
2180;It took around 15 minutes for a waiter to even GREET us and introduce themselves. We weren't even told any personal favourites or specials. It's funny because I was asking my friends where our waiter was when she was actually right next to us, speaking to other customers. She even looked at me when I asked but decided to come 15 minutes later. How immature or her. The server was also very pushy and rushed us into getting our food. Speaking of food, it was TERRIBLE! Don't even bother wasting even a dollar here.
2181;Me and my family went to East Side Mario's  2171 Steeles Ave W, Toronto, ON M3J 3N2. My son, who is almost three years old, has contracted food poisoning from this restaurant after eating their spaghetti and meatballs. It was ordered from the kids menu.  I want to make sure that no other family and child goes through what he is going through.
2182;DONT GO THERE I've been here before and the service and food wasn't bad, but the second time was terrible. The manager  doesn't know exactly what's going on
2183;Very disappointment in this dish. I decided to try something new and the picture of the dish caught my eye. However after ordering it and being served....it did not look anything like the picture and it was lacking in seasoning. The chicken breast was tiny and had very little Italian sausage. Altogether it lacked taste/seasoning and didn't not appeal to me after seeing it in person. Extremely disappointed and not satisfied with this dish what so ever. Will never order it again.
2184;Had very bad experience here. Waiter was rude and order was very slow .He told me he has to charge me extra because I tried some of my husband 's salad ! Really? !Two Tables beside us shared their salad too just right beside us also ordered pasta ! This is our first time here and will NEVER come back!!!
2185;My cousin and i went for a few drinks and a meal, thinking hell why not its close by.  Don't bother.  We sat there, while 3 other tables that came 10-15 minutes later were served before us.  three servers all ignored us, finally we got a hold of someone and guess what...he was our server just Didn't know about it.  We got sub-par drinks and the lady across from us ordered a Vegetarian dish and got one with meatballs and the other with Seafood.  A total of 3 people were complaining around us.So hey if you want to experience being ignored and treated like you have leprosy than feel free to hit this place up,oh and as for the food, my chicken parm was dry as an ashy elbow on a summer day. Yeah...No thank you.
2186;Kind of lazy at this location. Ordered a Cesar and there was no spice on the glass rim and no celery. The waiter was great though. Food is crap as usual. This is not Italian by any means. Might as well go get bottled sauce at the grocery store.
2187;Upon arrival we were told about a 15 minute delay, however we see many empty tables (some still dirty). At this point I should have left (guess I never learn)!The service at this restaurant sucks so much. The waiter was negligent and messed up a lot, with no apologies. Food is just meh. For the price there are so many other options. I will avoid this place like the plauegeb
2188;Wow, worst restaurant experience ever. Ate in the bar for the "Appy" Hour, they only have one bartender working and expect him to bus tables and take orders from all the bar patrons and make the drinks for the entire resaurant. It took 30 minutes to get my nachos and my girlfriends salad. After and hour the pasta and bread loaf never came. Even after the bar tender asked what the order was a second time. Instead of waiting we asked to take it off the bill and cancel the order. Unfortunatley I had to leave a bad tip, but someone has to take responsibility for this awful service. Another note to mention was that the tables beside us were not bussed for the entire hour we were there and they sat in a disgusting state. Familys that were there got served before us, when we had arrived at least 15 minutes before them. I will never go to a East Side Mario's again, what a shame they used to have a higher level of service.
2189;Ordered delivery. Took two hours (one hour late) and the food wasn't even warm when it arrived. Hard to say what it would have been like hot and fresh.Village salad - no dressing at allChicken souvlaki on pita - all had nasty wilted lettuce in them, ruined the taste even after the lettuce was pulled outTzatziki - pretty good, but very smallStuffed grape leaves - pretty goodCalamari - tough, but we reheatedHummus - tasteless with an odd texture
2190;Located on the northwest corner of Bloor and Manning Streets, the place is a long narrow restaurant that is really poorly laid out. Not only is the place really disorganized inside, the serving counter is a mess with lots of equipment on top of it and located just when you enter the door. The place smelled like it hadn't been cleaned in ages. The server, didn't wash their hands or wear gloves which left me feeling unsure about what they served. I can't rate their food because I didn't eat anything given the lack of hygiene. Good luck to anyone who braves their food.
2191;The first time I ordered delivery from here they never showed up.  We waited an hour and a half and finally called back.  They claimed they buzzed us but no one answered - totally not true, b/c we had our phones on ring and they never rang.  Even if that was true, they had our phone numbers and never called.  Since they were now closed they refused to fill our order.  Fortunately we hadn't paid yet, but that was definitely enough to deter me from ordering there again for awhile.The second time I ordered the food actually made it to my apartment.  Unfortunately, I learned that it wasn't worth it.  Not only was it expensive, but my gyro didn't even had tzatziki sauce on it!  The fries were so soggy and not even worth eating.
2192;Ordered the Sunday special for a chicken Greek salad ... When I opened the take out container ... 4 pieces of very dry chicken and about one small handful of salad ... It was not a meal, it was a side other and no tzatziki as promised
2193;Mortified.I found many things to be wrong with this place, I ordered food for delivery and waited and hour and thirty five minutes. Upon arrival I caught the  driver speaking very poorly about me to tennants in the lobby. When i got up stairs my calamari was cold, the Styrofoam container looked like it was used before, my souvlakis where soggy, which made no sense as it had no sauces or dressing on it. and when i called to ask for a refund, i was yelled at,  disrespected more then  told to call the manager. upon callling he refused to refund me, unless i went to pry out the food i had thrown out in the trash. as it didnt look safe to consume, his reasoning was i needed to "return his food". I was very disappointed, I will never be eating or ordering food from this place for that matter. Just disgusting
2194;Came here for greek salad takeout, the lady behind the counter was very surly from the first interaction. She was also extremely stingy with the salad options. When I asked for extra pickle, she (no exaggeration) used her tongs to pick up a single slice of pickle (same goes for the tomatoes). She also failed to give me any napkins or cutlery, so I was forced to stop off at another restaurant to ask for some. The food was below par to say the least. Salad was extremely bland with 99% of it being lettuce. The chicken skewer was pretty good however. I definitely wouldn't recommend this place. Terrible service, terrible experience, not so great food.
2195;I can barely give this place one star. The rice was chalky, the chicken skewer had 4 small pieces the size of a grape on it, the potatoe had dark soft bits on it and the bread was not a pita, it was greasy naan. You could barely say there was tzaziki on it and there is definitelt zero tzaziki to dip your pita/naan in. We should have known when we walked into this place. Sometimes you walk into a place and keep ordering despite your better judgement and then when you leave with the food, you wish oh why I hadn't I chosen one of those other places I was thinking of? This was one of those places. For those who want to know, this is what you get for a chicken souvlaki plate: 4 pieces of small skewered chicken, approximately 4 pieces of cut up iceburg lettuce (like what you get in a bento box) with no dressing, white rice, 3 pieces of brown potatoe, a drizzle of tzaziki (approximately a teaspoon), one piece of folded greasy naan bread, and one olive. There's your chicken dinner!
2196;Stay well away from this one, not worth going to for even a cup of coffee. Service was very slow (despite three servers, and a less then half full restaurant) and food was awful. We just stopped for a snack after walking the gallery, so ordered a cup of coffee and a cheeseboard to share. Coffee came, was nearly cold (despite just being poured) and the cup came on a plate that was so dirty it would not be passable at a Tim Horton's, let alone a relatively pricey cafe. The cheeseboard was horrible, tasted like a selection of flavourless Kraft grocery store cheeses, not "Artisan Quebec Cheeses" as the menu claimed. Came with about 8 crackers, and bread that was so stale it was rock hard and unusable. Bread had some sort of balsamic on it, but had not been freshly poured, it had been done so long ago it was completely dry. Everything felt extremely cheap, and at a premium price. Left feeling ripped off and wondering why such a great gallery allows this place to run on their grounds. Do yourself a favour and avoid
2197;If I could give this place a lower star rating then 1*  I would!! Not because of their food (which I didn't try) but because they charged $3.50 for a bottle of WATER!!! They aught to be ashamed of themselves for charging this amount!! This is the definition of "PROFITEERING"!! To make 300% profit on a product is unconscionable!!
2198;awful place..cappuccino was served almost cold, no napkins, profiteroles were obviously frozen and storebought, however the waitress argued with me and said they were made fresh and stored in the fridge..they were obviously frozen. Service was slow and the waitress was shuffling around like she didn't want to be there. If i could give less than one star, I would. This place gives Toronto and McMichael a VERY bad name...i would be ashamed to take any of our European guests there.
2199;Would give zero stars if I could. Sandwich selection was limited to Roast Beef which was drier than the Saraha. I asked for condiments (mayo, mustard...) was told no...we only have butter. Prices are ridiculously high, $3.50 for a small bottle of water. Only go here if you are starving and desperate.
2200;This cafe is located in one of the finest museums I've ever visited. So why do they support this terrible cafe? I went today with my partner and his cousin. The service was extremely slow and it wasnt particularly busy.  I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with roasted beets, spinach and cheese. The waitress brought me a chicken sandwich. I sent it back and when I finally got it after everyone was almost finished, I took a bite and instead of beets, I found something like a thinly sliced potato. It turned out to be thinly sliced, crunchy, flavorless pear. I called the waitress and told her that it was supposed to have beets and she just said that they were out and put the pear in instead. I told her she should have asked me if I still wanted it before she brought it out.  Anyway, all three dishes sucked, my cousin's kale salad had gritty sand or dirt in it. Nothing had any flavor. The desserts were creme brule (boring) and the cream cheese brownie was hard and flavorless. Enjoy the great museum but do not eat
2201;Order was 15 mins late then half my order was missing! Waited another 35 mins for the rest of my order to arrive. Manager refused to do anything about it and blamed the just eat app that we ordered through. Do yourself a favour and order anywhere else. When I finally did get to eat, I was disgusted to find that the crust was barely cooked. Horrible service and barely tolerable food.what a waste.
2202;Not recommended.We called to order pizza and asked for a couple things on half the pizza (which it allows us to order online).  The guy started yelling at my boyfriend while ordering.  I could hear the yelling and I wasn't the one on the phone.  Anyway, my boyfriend had to hang up on the Mamma's Pizza worker.Because I really wanted to try the vegan pizza, we figured we'd just order online.  It went through but then they called because the online ordering wasn't working.  So I went to tell the guy my order but I couldn't get past the vegan cheese.  All I wanted was vegan cheese instead of regular cheese, it's advertised right outside the store.  The guy had no clue what I was talking about.  He kept listing other types of cheese (feta, cheddar, etc.) and didn't seem to understand the concept of vegan cheese.  Eventually I just hung up because I really don't think I should be spending over five minutes advertising something on their menu.
2203;Do not order delivery from this location. The manager is a liar. I phoned and ordered 2 pizzas, one to pay by Visa and one to pay by cash. They delivered only1 pizza and claimed that I only ordered one Pizza. The manager literally called me a liar. Never again.
2204;I strongly suggest anyone to disregard this place. They have horrible tasting food. I spent 45$ on a family meal and 85% of it was thrown away cause it tasted nasty and the 2nd day it had an awful smell. Stay away from this place...
2205;This places food is total crap. At least the food I had. I ordered the Chicken Noodles & they were terrible. Lots of cheap veggies (carrots/Bok Choy) with lots of poor taste. I'd say avoid this place.
2206;To bad there is no negative stars I would give it a 3.  This place is dreadful please stay away I have warn you so if you go, you deserve all the bad food you can eat. I just bought home 4/20/2017 chicken fried rice and egg foo young the rice wasn't the worst but the egg foo young was totally horrendous the chicken in that stuff wasn't any thing like the chicken in the rice which I think was real  the gravy they give you on the side well when I opened it up it was like water I poured it over the egg foo young and it ran all over the plate it saturated my rice I threw it all out minus a few fork portions I tried. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone . Well there a couple of people I would nah maybe not even them  it this is by far the worst Chinese food I every ate in my life. Honey please come home.
2207;Went in specifically for the Smokin' Habanero Chicken. Zero on the heat factor. I used the chipotle dipping sauce for the sweet potato fries and it was spicier.The one at Wendy's is far superior and better tasting.Wont be back for it.Male staff member was more interested in hitting on a female customer than doing his job. Others were working while he stood behind the counter talking to the girl for over 5 minutes.... Just sad really.
2208;This is the worst A&W I've ever been to. Burgers are always cold, never fresh, condiments are put on with way too heavy a hand, the chicken is bland and chewy, such a shame, a good A&W would have been great for this area.Avoid.
2209;I'll let pictures do the talking. They have the worst worst quality of oil ever used in human history. They must have not changed it in a long while. I'm sure a&w head office do require oil changes within a set time limit. But there is no way this location is following rules set by head office. The onion rings and fries are sooo dark in colour. They taste sooo disgusting. If you look at the little smudge of oil dropped on my counter you can see it is darker in colour than even coke. Purely disgusting! Do anything to avoid this place
2210;Bland food. Expensive. Staff have poor interpersonal skills making ordering food feel like pulling teeth.
2211;I wish I couldn't even give this place one star. I ordered takeout from them for a group of 6 people. When the food arrived it was cold and bland. The potatoes were as hard as a rock. When I called them to notify them, they were aware that the potatoes were hard and mentioned that they had switched potatoes and that's all they had. Knowing this they still decided to sell this product, did not refund me but issued a credit. Months later I decided to claim my credit, but of course they could not locate this credit and did not reimburse me. Stay away from this restaurant  they are a bunch of scammers!!!
2212;My wife and I used to drive by here on our way home for work and regularly go through the drive through for Classic Chicken Souvlaki dinners.  Not the best greek food out there, but the drive through was convenient.  However, the past 2 times they've refused to fill an order for the "Classic" option (2 sides instead of 1) as apparently they don't do the classic through the drive-thru.  It's not like it adds any extra containers or anything, but now they adamantly refuse to do it.If I could give 0 stars I would, for the price there are much better non-chain-restaurant options in Brampton who are now just as inconvenient as Mr Greek Express.
2213;Horrible shawarma, horrible service. The workers are rude and you do not get what you payed for. I payed 15 dollars for the mixed shawarma platter and the woman gave me 2 potatoes, when I kindly asked her for more she gave me a dirty look and proceeded to add 1 extra potato............................. The sauces also taste bad. Overall the food quality seems old and not worth it.
2214;I've been to many locations and it's probably my favourite mall restaurant franchise but I avoid this location.Most staff are more interested in yelling out to passing people than serving you. And they're really stingy with their serving size.
2215;Ordered a number 7 falafel and it was awful. I enjoyed everything but the falafel itself. The falafel was cold and bitter. It's the kind of bitterness you taste when barbecue meat is burnt to a crisp. I couldn't finish it. The total was $9.60, I'm going to stick to Jimmy the Greek which is across from them if I want mediterranean next time.
2216;Horrible. It WAS amazing when the old girls worked here. Won't be surprised if this place closes down in the next couple months.
2217;Would give it a negative if I could. Used to go there all the time and got great service and decent food. However, it appears to have changed ownership. The food is not up to par and now the food portions shrunk significantly. Falafels lacked flavor and seemed like they had been refried several times over. Used to go quite often but will be my last visit. Plenty of other places serving up shawarma and Falafels. No thanks........
2218;Under new managment and they are ruining this once awesome place. The food is now bland -- they don't provide the hummus/garlic sauce unless you ask for it (and even then it is an anemic 1/2 tablespoon). the salad options are mediocre (and bland) and the service sizes have shrunk to the point of no longer being of value.The new management got rid of the old staff and now surcharge everything... its such a shame -- they even water down the tahini sauce.. seriously?!?!?!!? so sad this place is dieing.. they wont be seeing my $$$ any time soon.
2219;This place used to be great, but since new ownership has gone downhill. I'm actually writing this review having had their chicken skewer plate yesterday, and ended up getting severe food poisoning an hour or so later after getting home. I've been up all night vomiting over 6/7 times and have literally had no sleep. This will definitely be the last time I ever eat here, and will definitely advise others of doing the same. I will definitely not be surprised if this place closes down very soon.
2220;Rude f**king Asian girl...the first words that came out her mouth "what do you want!" I ask for a falafel sandwich she gave me some cold ass old falafel that look like it was sitting there the whole day the I asked sure I want everything on it she friggin shoves the veggies and breaks the friggin sandwich apart and then she warms it up for like 3 secs I get my sandwich and it look like the pic I will attached f*ck that I ain't eating it its f*cking cold and the sandwich is stuck on the f*cking wrap. You guys deserve a fuckin -5 worst service and food!!!
2221;This location give me "Burned Meat" Completely BLACK and DRY! I took it back for an exchange the girl told me "It's like that!" Really? I had it many times at Fairview Mall I can tell you  "It's not like that!" then she exchange me with another plate of dry meat. I throw the whole plate into the garbage! We'll never return!
2222;I wish there was an option of putting no stars for this place because, i would. I'm even surprised at the other reviews where people are saying "this place used to be great/good". No it has never been good! The employees are horrible, rude & pushy. The food is mediocre. I've grown up with mediterranean & middle eastern food, so i know about the food and how it should taste. The meat is always burnt or overcooked, some of the sides are ok, but they are so pushy with just dumping what the images of the plates look like on the menu board that you don't get a chance to ask about the items or select what you want. The last time i was there i was fed up with the burnt meat and simply asked how long it would take to fire up a fresh skewer (the ones there are swimming in oil and almost black because they've been warmed up so many times on the grill). They said it would take 15 minutes. I ended up waiting almost 40 minutes. The thing that ticked me off the most was, knowing that i had to wait, they plated up the rest 
2223;Horrible experience! Raw meat! Manager was very unkind and not helpful to the situation.
2224;Came here on a Saturday, and noticed it was quite busy, so wasn't expecting to be served anytime soon. Others were still waiting for their for about 5-7 minutes later, but of course it is saturday afternoon in the food court at the mall. Close to about 10 minutes, one of the ladies working mentioned they could give me chicken souvlaki since chicken shawarma was not ready. At this point I was pretty hungry and was waiting over 10 minutes, so I said thats fine. Asked for a knife, they don't have any... Alright, shook my head and just took my food to my table. Saw one small piece of chicken, ate it, and it was fine. Tried to cut one big chunk of chicken with my fork, since of course there were no knives..The piece of chicken was raw inside, and I don't mean pink cooked chicken..it was bloody and raw in the middle. I took the food immediately back to them since I was disgusted basically, if I had eaten that piece of chicken without trying to cut it with my fork, I would have probably gotten sick, if not contracte
2225;This location is rife with quality control issues - once, twice, three, fourth times.  Even provided feedback to head office. If you're looking to receive your food as ordered, move on to a different restaurant.   You'll always find something missing in the bag - or in the most recent case the fries were only half full.  We won't be returning here with our family and I strongly recommend you do the same.
2226;I have enjoyed McDonald's all along especially after their coffee has improved and with the latest promotion on iced coffee. The promotion has drawn me away from Starbucks ice coffee and Tim Horton's ice cappuccino.I have largely increase my consumption during McDonald's iced coffee promotion and I noticed once from this store that another customer ordered iced coffee with no ice. Then I just started realizing that this is a great idea, since I can customize my drink depending on the weather and how thirsty I am. Just like the way we could in Starbucks and Tim Horton. I could order full ice on a really hot day, half ice on an average day, and no ice on a thirsty and not so hot day.I started ordering as such in every McDonald's including this one with no problem for 2 months. All the sudden, a lady manager (not to mention name here) told me one day that I cannot do this kind of order since this is unfair to other customers because they are getting less coffee than I do if I were to order without any ice. S
2227;Wow. Walked in this place on a Wednesday and it was deserted. Only two customers that looked like friends of the waitress. The waitress didn't even realize that my friend and I was there until she glanced over and saw us that we already seated ourselves. Didn't even greeted us. Gave us the menus and left. She went back the to bar and kept talking to her "friends" . When we knew what to order i had to wave her down and called out really loud to get her attention.  Waited on the wings for 10 minutes. Wings arrived and it was bad. The wings were small and the chicken just tasted weird. My friend said the same thing with hers. Waitress never back to check up on us. We ate at least three wings and stopped and payed our bills.  Never again.
2228;I had lunch at this Wild Wing today.  I've been to a couple Wild Wing restaurants in downtown Toronto and have liked them.I got there at noon and the restaurant was quiet and sad.There are nine wings to an order.  I hadn't had breakfast and knew I wouldn't have supper 'til late so ordered a double order with Dill-icious Honey and Whiskey Girl sauces.  I'm glad I ordered a double order.  Despite the sign on the wall behind me boasting that their wings are plump and juicy, mine weren't.  Mine were mostly small and overcooked.  The dill sauce was good but the BBQ and honey garlic sauces that were on them was mild ... so mild that I couldn't tell which was which.I won't be going back to this location again.
2229;Why and how this location is still open is beyond me. It's clear that the staff and owner just don't seem to care anymore. I brought an out-of-town friend to this location for lunch on Thurs. May 7, 2015 and I felt so bad for doing so. The bar literally had 3 tables seated and one waitress working who doubled as the bartender. It took her 33 minutes (we counted) to come and ask us for our order *despite* us trying to flag her down 3-4 times in the process. Keep in mind, it was not at all busy. Our food arrived 20 minutes after we placed the order (we'd now been at the bar for over 50 minutes). It took her another 15 minutes to get me a refill of water, even though we were seated right next to the bar. The waitress put on a sour face after realizing my friend had refused to tip her. I mean, tips are earned and she definitely didn't deserve one. The entitlement was real, lol. Overall it was a terrible experience. Perhaps this Wild Wings would do a lot better if they started caring about the handful of p
2230;If I could give these guys a zero I would. They straight up told me to go some where else because they were full. No wait time, nothing... Just go somewhere else. What the fuck?
2231;Okay wings, pricey and mediocre service.I love wings - wild wings has good flavours but comes to over a dollar a wing. What a rip off. On two occasions to get my water refilled or even attended to by the waitresses has been   A challenge. Then when I pay the bill- I get complemented on my earrings and my shirt. I don't appreciate when there's bad service then you make face for a nicer tip. Give me great service, then you'll get a good tip. Better wing places out there within the area although it has good seating here.
2232;I tend to go here for lunch every now and then. I have to say the latest server they have is beyond horrible. I sat down at the bar and waited 10 minutes to order a beer. Then had to flag her down to ask for a menu. Thought I'd give it another shot, got the same server just ordered my usual without going through the trouble of asking for a menu. Got my wings and beer, no napkins, no bone plate, and she disappeared from there. Going to search for a new wing spot.
2233;Horrible ExperienceWent to Wildwings for takeout at about 6pm.  Place was dead.  Like, not a soul in there.  We put in a order and asked them how long.  about 15-20mins.  Cool, sounds good.  Paid for the goods.  My wife waits inside.  I'm jamming with my kids to the Moana soundtrack in the car.  30mins roll around.  My wife still didn't come out.  One of my kids wants to go inside, so no problem, I bring her inside with my wife.  I'm back in the car with my other kid.  Wife checks with the waitress to see how's the order's going . The order didn't go through.  Apparently, the girl who initially took the order left for the day and didn't tell anyone about the order.  No one's fault right?  But wait, no one bothered asking the single customer in the whole damn restaurant what the hell's she doing there for 30mins while the kitchen is not active?  What?  She there to watch the game?  Wtf.  Whatever, the waitress says it'll take another 15mins.15mins later, I'm tired of listening to the damn Moana soundtr
2234;We live close by and at one point I preferred wings at Wild Wing to All-Stars. No way in hell can I say the same today. The wings tasted different. The Cadillac Ranch I used to order didn't taste right. I don't care that they added a side of fries to every wings order... because the fries are soggy and undercooked here. The service... I don't know what to say. While the waitresses probably had good intentions, they were flat out annoying. What upset us the most was the lack of cleanliness. Let me illustrate. We walked in and waited to be seated. The seats we were offered were at the very back behind a party (where you can't see TVs) and at the front beside the entrance (where it gets cold). There were 4-5 unmanned tables that needed to be cleaned. We weren't offered these tables. What bothered us more was the fact that after we were done our wings, those same tables were still never cleaned! Furthermore, every table wasn't cleaned. We were literally in the middle of dirty tables (picture attached). I have a
2235;Horrible service. Went to pick up take out and waited 45 minutes for food. 1 person in the kitchen and one waiter. The one at mcowan and finch is a lot better
2236;The fact this place is still open blows my mind. Only reason we went to this restaurant is because it was late (10pm) and close to us. Had a table for 8, mind you there were only about 6-7 tables seated. Took 10 mins for the waitress to come take our orders, waited 25-30 mins for the food to come. Everything came but two orders of wings.. again 5 mins later the waitress comes back and asks what we ordered..yep another 20 mins for two orders or wings. Asked for water couple of times but did not receive.. waitress had their friends coming in and was talking to them the entire time.Finally asked for the bill and there was a 15% service charge added on the bill which is fine..restaurant policy.. but you'd expect at least a decent service. Brought it up to the manager's attention but he came back to me saying it was really busy.. which it wasn't... and also 25 mins is the ideal time it takes for the food to come out. He then decided to knock off 2 bucks for the poutine upgrade.Never will I step foot in this 
2237;WORST WILD WING EVER. Steer clear. Manager has no clue about customer experience.  Actually tried to argue with me about the time I arrived to the restaurant (we waited 30 minutes for our appetizers), on top of that the calamari was the worst thing I've ever tasted. No napkins, side plates or cutlery on the table plus my 5 year old complained of it being "too sticky". He's 5!! Waitress interrupted me while i was complaining about lack of items, to tell they "ran out of side plates"?!. After all of this the manager still charged me for the calamari, when I opted to leave and cancel dinner. Poo on a stick covered in sugar would be better than that experience. Opt to starve...do not eat here.
2238;Horrible.My girlfriend and I came here tonight. There was a huge party. We waited at the door for 10 mins. No server was in sight to assist us as they were both busy with the party. We finally sat ourselves... and waited! They were checking tables of other guests when they were busy with the party! get the attention of a server! 18 mins later my girlfriend got furious and tried to wave down a server and asked to speak to the manager... the server said there's no manager... how you run an establishment without an on duty manager makes no sense and instead of apologizing she made excuses.We just walked out
2239;Recently visited this location and unfortunately the food and service was a big miss. I usually like Wild Wings for their gar par wings. Here the wings were small, over fried, and the flavours were not consistentent with the other locations. Also, they gave us dirty cups and napkins. Head over to the Woodside Square location instead.
2240;I went there on a Sunday in July around 6pm.  I was surprised that only 3 tables with customers in total of 7 people.  The waitress's face was bad and no smiling. She doesn't feel like to serve us.  The wings were bad.  Will never come back.
2241;This place was not too bad when it 1st opened, but it has spiraled into a dump. The tables are always sticky and every one of them wobbles.  How hard is it to align legs or put something under it, I mean really!!The lighting is terrible, it's cold inside, smokers go in and out bringing in the cold wind and smoke with them. The servers spend more time flinging their hair back and forth and launching cleavage into the faces of the drunken regulars who seem to be sitting at the bar every time I've been there.  They barely notice you come in, and never check on you.  Constantly mess up your order. The big guy who made amazing wings has moved on, replaced by a long list of goofballs who cannot cook and either undercook or overcook the wings/fries. Owners - please clean up this dump. The only good thing I can say about this location is they have the best Dill Dip.... Which is why I go here as a last resort. Otherwise - I would have stopped long ago. Oh BTW - the new wings they switched to last year 
2242;Came here a few days ago and I called before to confirm the halal wings were available and they said they are out of non-breaded but have the regular breaded wings. I got 2 lbs. of the HALAL breaded wings in zesty lemon and korean bbq, our server was great, wings were awesome! The tables were SUPERR sticky, lots of fruit flies were in the air, drinks were flat but I was like whatever the food was good. Came back yesterday after work and a long drive for the Tuesday 1/2 price wings ($7) and our server told us:1. They do not serve HALAL breaded wings at this location (even after I explained I bought them just a few days ago), she said maybe our server put it on the bill as HALAL but they definitely do not have breaded HALAL wings there...So I guess my wings were not halal?2. They do not have an option to order any wings without a side order...weird 3. Although it is half price on Tuesday, every lb. ordered required the purchase of an additional drink even though their soft drinks are usually refillable, me
2243;Took literally 45 mins for us to get our bill and pay after first asking. Food sucks compared to the other Wild Wings I go too. Never coming here again. You're better off driving a couple minutes more to the Copper Creek location or the 16th and Markham one.
2244;Horrible customer service and the rice tasted like it was sitting there for a long while.. Really hard.
2245;The staff at this location is extremely rude. Will stick to the other Freshii locations downtown!
2246;Stay away from their "best seller" the Warrior Chicken Bowl as much as you can. It is a big bowl of rice with very little veggie, all-right amount of chicken, but absolutely too much ranch dressing. The dressing mixed so well with the rice, making it too heavy. I can't relate to this poorly designed dish to healthy eating. I finished half bowl, and after 10 hours, still feel too much burden on my stomach. Ironically, I enjoy heavy food, but  the Warrior Chicken is beyond what I can take. The order came surprisingly fast. It took less a minute for me to get the bowl. Limited seats as previous posts mentioned.
2247;I have been to many Freshii locations and this location is the worst. The place is dirty, the staff are rude and the food isn't the best. I would try to stay away from this location. The one on Yonge and Bloor is much better
2248;Let me start by saying, I really like Freshii. I eat at the location on Yonge near Roselawn often. I saw this location on King one day and decided to pop in for lunch. My first clue really should have been the strange layout. They have a giant wall and you can't see the food prep. That makes me a tad nervous. I ordered the Pangoa bowl, which I have had many times at other locations - usually it is full of a medly of ingredients. This one was about 90% rice. That's right. A $9 bowl of rice. It seems the lack of vegetables is a constant in these reviews - clearly the owners of this particular location are trying to save a bit of money... Never again. I'd rather eat dirt.
2249;Came here on a Friday for their Buffalo wrap $7 lunch special. It comes out to $11.28 for a tasteless cold wrap. In fact they applied no discount and charged $1.99 for chicken. They said it was because of the chicken. Apparently a Buffalo wrap does not come with chicken. Will not be coming back.
2250;Terrible.  $9 for a Tuna wrap which was enormous - but 80% of it was shredded lettuce. Tuna, feta and other ingredients almost impossible to detect.
2251;Let me start by saying I really like Freshii as a chain but this location is bad!Firstly I find it disconcerting that I can't see the ingredients/prep area. This location has a 5 1/2 foot high wall all the way along where the counter might normally be which I think is just strange. It gives me the impression that they are trying to hide something. Also, you can barely see if the staff are there.Secondly, and more importantly the staff that have served me here on a few occasions are really rude. I would be a regular at this location if the above wasn't the case because the food is consistent with freshii's high standards but the unfriendly staff just wind me up.
2252;The worst customer service experience in Toronto. Shocked when the surly attendant grunted at me following the placement of an order (I chose straight from the menu and made no requests for customizations).After handling my money and touching equipment nearby the cash register the attendant proceeded to prepare food without washing hands or putting on gloves. Additionally, the take away food container was thrown down behind a sink as rice was prepared.Given the rest of the food preparation was to happen out of sight I immediately called the attendant over and requested my money back. I advised I would never return to this location.On the way out, two patrons asked what had happened and, on hearing the service experience, reflected that this location is known for bad service. Freshii - I love your franchise, but do something about this location. They are ruining your brand.
2253;I ordered a protein salad and the majority of salad was spinach and barely any toppings. It was disappointing given the salads are not cheap. I agree with another reviewer with the large wall in front of counter it is like they are trying to hide something. I do not recommend this location.
2254;Let me say that this particular location should not turn you off Freshii as a chain. It can be pretty good. But this one... it's like they hate vegetables. No matter what I order, I have to specify extra veg just to get something that resembles a normal bowl elsewhere. You could probably pile up all the vegetables in a single tablespoon. The same goes for the sauce. The rest is just a mass of bland, stuck together noodles or warmed over brown rice. Terrible. You are better off going to IQ Foods if you want this sort of food. Or Kupfert & Kim's. Worst. Freshii. Ever.
2255;I have been to other Freshii locations before and was happy with them, but I was really disappointed with this location. My first issue. Last week they posted a $5.00 special on an advertising board but upon entering the restaurant I was told that the special was advertised only if I purchased a drink. Not a big deal, but still very misleading. My 2nd issue, after ordering a salad from a girl working the cash register, my order was quickly put together by another gentleman who obviously did not enjoy working there. After putting my order together and slamming it on the counter, I asked him where I could find a fork and napkin and he just 'pointed'. A good dining experience usually involves good food, great service and a clean restaurant. I will give this place 3 stars for the food, 0 on the service and 1 for cleanliness (hence my 1 star rating) I can't condemn an entire chain for one bad location but if you are visiting Freshii and live or work at King and Church, avoid this location!
2256;I've eaten at a lot of freshii's and usually get the same thing but this location was pretty bad. I ordered the soup and there was probably all of 10 noodles (not even full noodles but like the last bits of a package all cut up) there was also an unidentified ingredient that I took out and the chicken was fatty and seemed poor quality. Won't go back to this one.
2257;Looks all nice, and the ladies that work at this location are very friendly.... However I found a large moth in my salad. Sadly after mentioning this to others, I am hearing more horror stories of bugs in food from this location
2258;This is probably the worse Eggsmart I've ever been to... Food sucks and you get no service at all. I don't understand how anyone can mess up breakfast food.We got there around 2pm and the store was pretty empty, a man was leaving at that time. We were the only customers there. After the food arrived, 2 of the staff started cleaning the store, mopping the floor around us while we were eating... The waitress never came over and asked if we needed anything, or how the food was. I ordered coffee and she never even bother checking if I needed a refill, or refill for water.I was very disappointed at the food. I ordered the "Montreal meat with hash and egg" (I think that's the name). When the food came it looks fine, until I flipped over the egg... There was a very small amount of meat but chunks of onions. The menu said "caramelized onions". All I could taste was regular onion slices, the potato had no flavour. I don't understand how breakfast can taste this bad. My boyfriend upgraded his fries to sweet pot
2259;This place is utter trash I'm actually mad that I'm member of the human race after going to this establishment. Within my 17 years on earth, I've always loved breakfast and breakfast loved me, until I went to this eggsmart. Now I can't even touch a home-fry without having PTSD, but I've rambled too long. Let's go into my experience with this atrocious restaurant. To start, I love the brand of eggsmart, the company and I even own eggsmart merchandise. I love their marketing, and I do think they're eggs are smart ). I've been to many eggsmart in my short life and I've thoroughly enjoyed my experience at every single one I've been to. BUT NOT ANYMORE. This restaurant has completely destroyed any hope I've had in this company. It was a utter disappointment when my biracial friend and I walk through the singular door to be met with no greeting, no service, and absolutely no "freshly squeezed" orange juice. Every time I wanted something I had to raise my hand and yell "LADY". I ordered the "early bird special" A S
2260;I had visited other Eggsmart locations in Downtown Toronto and liked them. My mother was curious after hearing about some of my positive lunch experiences, so we visited this particular branch one day to have a small lunch.The store is quite big, and is well-maintained and clean. The food quality, however, leaves much to be desired.We ordered a grilled chicken caesar with the intention of splitting it. The portion served, however, was not at all like the other locations I have been to: there was 1 piece of toast (cut in 2 halves) and approximately 1 piece of 'grilled' chicken cut into 5 thin strips.The 'Texas toast' was very thin - not at all like what I thought was a Texas toast. It did not seem to be prepared in any way other than being heated in cooking oil until slightly burnt. The 'grilled' chicken didn't seem like it was actually grilled. It looked and tasted like chicken that has been pre-boiled in water and briefly re-heated on a grill - it was not well-boiled, even, as the texture was as ro
2261;How do you mess up breakfast? Go to this Eggsmart, that's how.My family and I went to this location for a quick brunch. When we entered the restaurant, it was only half filled, and yet our waitress was pretty atrocious. After bringing our drinks and taking our order, she basically disappeared - I had to flag down a different server to ask for a refill on my coffee.About half an hour after we placed our order - I'm not exaggerating - our food showed up undercooked and cold. My mother-in-law had to grab cutlery from another table, because our waitress forgot. How do you spend 30 minutes cooking a pancake and still manage to serve it RAW and COLD? As for the pancakes that weren't raw, they had little flavour and were excessively chewy. On top of the bad food, the cook somehow managed to set his grill on fire while we were eating and the restaurant was filled with smoke. Could this place be any worse?All told, this was an incredibly disappointing breakfast. It was my first time at an Eggsmart and, God h
2262;Utter disappointed to start the day...Potatoes were undercooked.Pancakes tasted flouryService to get the bill took a little too long (10-15mins)
2263;If only I could give no stars at all.I frequent the Eggsmart at Woodbine and John, so when I go to an Eggsmart, I don't expect fancy food like Smash or Inspire. The food at this Eggsmart was terrible. I ordered a classic breakfast, that included 3 poached eggs, 4 strips of bacon, 4 slices of toast, a slice of orange and a slice of papaya. As the server came with the food, I could see from the bottom of the plate that 2 of the toasts were burnt, to the degree that it was completely black. When the server put the plate in front of me, everything looked fine, so I assumed she didn't know about the burnt toasts and I flipped the burnt ones for her to see. Even showing her the burnt toasts didn't elicit any reaction. She dropped 2 pouches of jam and asked if there's anything else I need, then she left. Aside from this, the fruit slices were paper thin, much smaller than the ones served at any other Eggsmart locations I have visited. I have never left an Eggsmart without a fully satisfied tummy until this. 
2264;Terrible.They gave me a different order.The sweet potato fries is so salty and oily.And the omelet is terrible.I never put any comment before but I can't help it now.
2265;I was extremely disappointed with the service here. we came here for brunch, (should saylunch) and the restaurant only had one other couple there.the waitress came over and because we knew what we wanted we ordered right away. He got eggs Benny with turkey bacon and soft eggs I got just the eggs Benny with soft eggs.- our order was wrong, she gave us hard eggs- seeing as the restaurant was empty, she could have come over to see if we needed anything, she never did.we had to ask for more water and juice she didn't even come over to ask if everything was okay after we finished we had to ask for the bill. truly disappointed. I'll stick to the eggsmart on Kennedy and 401 for my breakfast fix.
2266;I'm pretty tolerant to bad experiences but Eggsmart took the cake on this one. Service was okay, they were peeling potatoes on the side...okay whatever...I guess I'll yell when I need service...ugh.I got the eggs Benedict, probably one of the most unappealing eggs Benedict I have ever had. The sauce was lumpy, it had a weird discolouration, and my plate had a pool of water because of the poached eggs, which I didn't think the cook bothered to strain out...I make way better food than this.  Overall, huge disappointment...and will be avoiding this place.
2267;This place has gotten new owners alot of times and each time people dont know how to properly serve someone. I've sent many emails complaining about this place to their head office. so far i never got a response back even leaving my number in the email.The food is not cook 100%, you have the women cutting up potatoes and chatting with one another in front of other customers. i thought eggsmart was a breakfast place not a greasy spoon diner in the middle of now where.As well you ask nicely for certain things to be done a certain way. they completely ignore you and risk your health. i don't want to get food poisoning do you?My friends and i ordered a huge big breakfast and we asked them nicely to not give us any homefries at all as we rather be eating everything else. She must've gotten insulted cause every single plate had far too much home fries in it. I don't bother with eggsmart anymore and go else where to a better place the listens to the customers.
2268;the worst service ever! lady who is placing the orders at drive through is the worst! she barely talks and she is very impolite. every time we come here to grab a coffee she just pissed us of with her attitude. plus I belive that all Mc Donalds employees should look tidy and have at least some manicure.
2269;Wow such horrible service. As we were paying in the drive thru the cashier looked so miserable! If you hate your job so much find another one! All he did was cuss when a new person would arrive through the drive thru. Yes it's 5am but it does not mean you scream "F#$@ go home people" and start mocking customers for coming to mcdonalds in the morning. Not to mention he's so tired he forgot our coffee and correct change.
2270;I would give 0 if I could. I got the create your own burger and it was terrible! They missed lost of the ingredients. They took 30 min to fix it. Plus don't order the guacamole, it's a joke. You pay for it and they put more ketchup than guacamole... It's a rip off....
2271;Super disappointed! Mostly because they had minimal topping selection and what they did have, sucked. Tomatoes were cut in huge chunks.The tabbouleh was just parsley! That is not tabbouleh.Will not return to this location.
2272;We ordered and we're charged for 2 reg pitas but we were given 2 small ones. It wasn't until we got home and started eating that we realized. The store was really dirty the floors, the doors, the tables. Yuk.
2273;If I could give it zero stars I would.This is the worst Mexican and burrito place in all of Toronto.  Especially given that there are so many options in this city, never, ever settle on this craphole when you are craving a burrito.  If you do, you will likely spend the following day chained to the toilet as their festering meats and rancid guacamole will make you wish you ate dog food instead.  DINE SAFE - I would advise checking this place out.I look forward to whatever type of restaurant takes its place when Tacorrito goes out of business
2274;I had a burrito here, wasn't good. There was no flavour, the veggies weren't that fresh, the spices weren't strong.. just didn't taste like a Spanish burrito.. more tasted like something someone TRIED to whip up in the kitchen at home with no experience... If you want true burritos, better off going to the burrito place more south on sherbourne behind the Rabba at Front & Sherbourne.. now they have an AWESOME burrito! Fyi, interior only looks cool but the food sucks.
2275;We ordered nachos and it ended up being that yellow squirt cheese. Thinking that management would understand we ask them to redo the order and put real cheese due to an allergy. They had said that they don't do this. Followed by them slamming the plate of nachos on the table and storming into the back. Probably some of the worst service I have ever seen.
2276;Tacorrito just opened near my condo and we were excited to check it out. Maybe there are some things that will be ironed out over time, but this is definitely not a place worth checking out right now.  I ordered a chicken & steak mix burrito, my friend ordered two soft tacos, and we split an order of chips and guac.  Service: It took nearly ten minutes for them to serve the couple of people in front of us. Service was really disorganized and customers were getting annoyed.  Food quality: Awful. The quality of the meat was atrocious and there was no real flavour, other than from the two full scoops of hot sauce that was put on my burrito. As a bachelor I am familiar the concept of covering up bland, crappy food with a lot of spice, but I don't expect that from a restaurant.  The chips weren't even tostitos quality and the guacamole was runny.Definite pass.
2277;Terrible food. Unfriendly staff. Do not honour their own coupons. Burritos are all filler beans/rice. Fish Tacos have a miniscule amount of a tilapia fish stick. Be careful if you ask for any dressing they will go wild and douse it on. Tons of better alternatives in the city.
2278;My experience could of have been better. Ordered on just eat and it was cold & soggy when it arrived so didn't get to enjoy it.
2279;Ive given this place 3 tries before putting a review on. I was really hoping to get better. In two times beans were undercooked, one of the times was unedible. I am not a big fan of beans so in both times I just scrape it out my burrito or Bowl and let it go... But last time the manager (or owner I don't know) sold me an almost brown guacamole. I was taking out and order guacamole on the side and when I got home I noticed it was a side of gross almost brown gracamole. Hope they close Soon so places with quality food can come along.
2280;my husband ordered breakfast at this location and while he was waiting for his food he seen a cockroach on the inside of the drivthru window!! The worker said they are everywhere and the managers don't do anything about it. Disgusting!
2281;They call it rotten Ronnie's for a reason... it will rot your guts! And, that's why so many of us drive through at 3am to get 6 chicken nuggets with mac sauce on the side along with a junior double cheese burger and junior mcchicken in order to create a "McGang-Bang" (see secret menu online for more details).  Don't judge me, you know you've been there too. HAHA!
2282;Seriously, how hard is it to make a medium coffee double double?You got my order wrong again.I asked you to do one thing, its not that hard ya know, one thing and you still got it wrong, its just a drink, nothing too mind boggling as far as i can see.Here is the recipe for my coffee.Put the cup under the dispenser, Push the button twice for cream, push the button twice for sugar, add coffee.Voila, you're done!Put a lid on that sucker and pass it thought the window.You got it wrong.  there was no sugar.  You suck1 star because i cant give you zero
2283;Extremely slow service! Food was cold.Place was not well kept. I think maybe not enough personal!
2284;This location is by far the worst one in town!!! I have visited here on several occasions and each time the ice cream machine is broken!!! It can't just be coincidence that EVERYTIME I go buy buy a mc flurry or a cone that the machine is down!!! Come on?!?!?  FIX the darn thing already!!!
2285;Prices continue to rise at McDonald's or as they would prefer to be called McCafe. They have added touch screens and laid off staff. Offer to carry your food in an attempt to make poor quality and higher prices some how more valuable. Come on its McDonald's we understand and continue to go even though Ronald has been dead for years. This location is no better or worse than any other but let's stop pretending to be something that you are not.A Big Mac is no longer big. What other company charges for condiments? Why is food served warm, not hot? A decent burger and fries with a drink served fresh and hot should be $14.00. That does not include anything at McDonald's.  Today we went and ordered lunch for three adults. One order of fries were hot. The other two not even warm. .the quarter pounder was  small and lame, a tiny piece of lettuce and three tiny onions.The McChicken was like rubber. Should we be surprised? It's our own fault and what we have come to expect from McDonald's.  I complained. The 
2286;This McDonald's is at the intersection of Eagle and Yonge street in newmarket and IT IS TERRIBLE!!!  DO NOT USE THEIR DRIVE-THRU!!! We live around the area and have gone there several times for a drive-thru order. 9 times out of 10 they get the order wrong. We will not be returning to this McDonald's anymore. The buns on the burgers are dry and there was one time where we got iced teas for our drive-thru order and it looked like iced tea, but it tasted like water, so we weren't sure what we were drinking. There is another McDonalds just north of Davis by Canadian Tire, go to that one instead.
2287;McLobster is McLousy!  If I had not had another lobster sandwich or sub, I would still conclude that this is pretty weak. However, since having Quiznos' Lobster sub, the difference is stark.The McLobster lacks flavor, color and appeal.  In contrast, the Quiznos product is sweet, salty, and flavorful. Another difference is the heft--McLobster is half the size of the medium sub at Quiznos for about the same price.I was sure that I was being too critical, having eaten an Australian lobster for $200 at the Ambassador, but after eating the McLobster, I immediately drove over to Quiznos and ordered their lobster sub. It was superior in every way, especially construction. My McLobster was not even assembled. Someone just threw a scoop of the fishy mix on one end of a hot dog bun and shut the lid. And value?  For $2 more I can get a Quiznos large sub that is twice the size of Mickey's mess. Sorry, Charlie...
2288;I feel sorry for the staffs at this McDonald's because off all the changes and lack off training which is shown in the service here .. Head office need to come back down and retrain how operations need to be . This not the only McDonald's location having this issue it all over Newmarket . If want service you need to get it outside off the town or just avoid eating McDonald's all to getter !
2289;You're craving ramen. You're in the Eaton Centre. You see the sign at Richtree Natural Market and consider pulling out your wallet at the ramen station. Don't do it. Walk away. Get something else, anything. I got the Tori Taitan Chicken and the meat was gross. Overprocessed slab of (boiled in bath water?) meat. Broth was tasteless. Noodles were blah. 33 cent instant noodles would be better. .
2290;Had high expectations for this place but it was a huge let down. They had lots of choices for fun but few looked appealing. Ending up getting the hangover burger. It is a burger with egg, mushrooms and peameal bacon on it. The burger meat was terrible, it had no flavour to it at all and the texture to it was like it was boiled to cook it. For a $15 burger I expected a lot more, I would not go back and wouldn't recommend it with so many other choices in the area.
2291;My review is for the "Street Eats" Restaurant. I came in here today looking for a good place to eat. I saw a burrito and I thought why not, It looked really good and fresh so I obtained said burritto. What I didn't want was attitude with my order and a skimping of the beef. The lady picked up a tong full of beef and 3 times, she took out the beef. There was literally less than a palm-full of shredded beef. When she wrapped it, she just wrapped it so messily and almost didn't care. I then paid for it and all I had was a $50 note. I honestly didn't see the tiny little paper label that said "We don't accept $50 and $100 bills. When I received my change, the cashier whom I believe is the owner of the restaurant gave me attitude as well and told me "next time we won't accept $50 bills and pointed to the sign. I said "Oh crap, sorry didn't realize. she just looked at me and turned away then turned back to the next customer. When I got my burrito, although the ingredients were fresh, the burrito was BLAND. It was li
2292;Just had lunch there. I got the crispy chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries. The bill came up to $17. Probably the worst lunch I've had in a while. The bacon wasn't cooked properly and the pretzel bun was soggy. I paid $4 for the fries and it didn't even cover the bottom of the box. I will never go back there again. Do yourselves a favor and stay away from this place.
2293;Worst place to eat in Queens West. No service what so ever. When the lady did decide to help she was rude and snobby. The food portions were tiny for what you pay. The actual building is falling apart and against building/ fire codes.....
2294;Went there after the Drake's kithen had closed- shortly after 11pm on a Sunday . Saigon was open. My friend ordered Pho which he had no complaints about---me, I wanted something sweet, I asked the lady (the same lady everyone speaks of in the previous comments) for fried bananas. She replies "I DONT HAVE THAT". I say "Ok, what cake do you have?" She just shook her head no. I then asked her more generally "Ok, what do you have that is sweet....?" she says nothing. No ice-cream, no cake, no fried bananas as the menu suggests.-_-
2295;Disgusting, not clean.  I ordered no 145 sweet and sour spareribs, it was actually a frozen weird meat in a thick cherry sauce.  I feel sick now.  I also noticed they serve sushi, hahaha, that sounds very risky to me.
2296;Bloody awful.  We saw the place on Restaurant Makeover a few years back.  So we went there.  The problem with the food was apparently that it was bland.  The tv show chef showed her how to cook with flavor.  In other words, at least bust out the salt and pepper.  Well, I guess the girl in the kitchen forgot whatever they showed her.  Our food was so bland, I asked the waitress if she could take my food back into the kitchen and add some cooking oil.  It was awful.  Never went back to the place.  No thanks.  And my date wasn't impressed either.
2297;Food was subpar but that was pretty much expected. The service was pretty much nonexistent though. I ordered an item and I never received it. I asked about my item and one of the employees told me they will bring it. When we were ready to pay I told them I never received the order and I was loudly embarrassed in-front of the everyone in the restaurant. It was quite embarrassing so I gave the lady enough to cover the cost and quickly scurried out.Save yourself the trouble and avoid this restaurant at all costs
2298;I went to the Drake hotel for a poetry slam, as usual.Then I was like - the weather is so nice and calm and breezy and beautiful, and it is 11 p.m. , what can I eat? Oh Saigon Flower? sushi and har gow? GREAT.Anyways - no. I ordered the har gow, Pho, sushi. Fail on all. I felt like I was eating acid and bleach. I dont know how to explain this. The HarGow did NOT have real shrimp in it.I would never eat here again. It says open till 330 a.m, which is cool for the late night crowd but ...no.I wish I went to Subway next door.
2299;Where to start with Saigon Flower. There are just so many things that went wrong here last night, that in the end it was hilarious. But will never go back.My general Tso tofu was soggy and bland. My partner ordered the vegetarian noodles but surprise surprise got fried pork which actually smelled like it was rotting. This terrible food took 45 minutes to arrive. Two other groups already left because they couldn't wait any longer. A woman came in for take-out twice in the span of an hour because they had not yet finished her phone order. Then there was the man yelling "This is madness!" because the machine declined his credit card three times whereas his bank (on the phone) kept telling him that the payment had successfully processed. And the staff at the restaurant refused to talk to him.Never seen so much restaurant drama in my life.
2300;I'm here right now and the female owner is actually cutting her nails in the service bar area in the main dining room. We just asked her to stop because we're on the verge of throwing up... It's very unhygienic! She obliged. This is sick. Where is the no star option?
2301;Does anybody work here? Walked in twice and was empty. Called once and said lady on the phone said she wasn't open (it was a weekday night). I'm confused.
2302;The most miserable place on earth!  That lady should really just pack it in and give way for somebody new to service the area with their food.
2303;Just ordered takeout for the first time. We ordered the pad Thai, shrimp cold roll, pork/shrimp spring roll, and the crab maki sushi. The cold roll was decent but the sauce it came with was absolutely horrible. I switched it out for a spicy Thai sauce I found in my pantry. My Bf had no complaints about the spring roll and said he'd order it again. However, the pad Thai was awful. It was so bland. It just tasted like chilli hot sauce. Don't get me wrong, I love spicy and have a high spice tolerance but it wasn't advertised as spicy at all. My bf couldn't even eat a bite. Lastly, the sushi was pretty horrible. We attributed it to the fact that we are use to eating sushi from koji, but I think regardless of our sushi standards this stuff would taste horrible either way. I wish I read the reviews before wasting $30 on this garbage.
2304;This is the worst Chinese food I've ever had. Not to mention the place is very strange inside and poorly run. I ordered takeout last week and when I went in to get it there were no employees to be found and there was a couple making out in one of the booths. After 10min I literally had to walk back into the kitchen and yell for someone to come help me. They were playing Indiana Jones on the TV very loud and there are stacks of papers, receipts, invoices everywhere. Very unorganized.The food itself was soggy, bland and saucy. Sweet and sour chicken balls were the only decent item but how hard is it to fry pre cooked/frozen chicken balls.It terrifies me that this place offers sushi as well. Just don't go here - you'd be better off at pizza pizza a few doors down (and I strongly dislike Pizza Pizza).
2305;Those who has seen my other reviews would know that I have been pretty fair with my reviews, some may say I may even be a tad generous.  This time however, it is not the case.I was working in the area and had a craving for sushi, and this was the closest sushi place that was in walking distance.  I went online to look at their menu and made a pick up order of a red dragon roll along with some salmon sashimi.Walked into the place, it was empty, went up to the counter and notice on the display case on the right side were bits and pieces of salmon wrapped in seran wrap.  I was worried that the salmon might be old, but I paid and carried it back to work.I made sure to smell the salmon just in case and it smelt of lemon. I ignored it and ate a piece. After chewing a few times, I started smelling the fishy smell from my breath, tasting that old fishy taste. Needless to say, I gave up on the sashimi.I had better hopes for the red dragon roll(after peeling off the salmon) The rice tasted like it was from a da
2306;Really bad service - none of the waitress seemed to care to do their job (talking on the phone, sitting up on the bar, wearing inappropriate clothing...), not friendly, just overall very unpleasantthe guy who seemed to be the owner was walking in and out with take out to the kitchen and didnt seem bothered about the staff wings were light drizzelled with sauce, not tossed & coated I have been here a couple of times and I cannot say one positive thing about this place, other wild wings are great but this location is horrendous - food & service here just absolutely suck and talking with other locals about this place I know I'm not the only one that thinks so.
2307;Just had the worst service I have ever had. Sat for 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged. No menus. Waitress finally got off her cellphone and came to the table and said she doesn't start her shift for another 10 minutes but will serve us. Lucky us!  Took our order. Brought the food and no silverware. Waited 5 minutes for a fork. When she brought our wings a free basket of fries were brought as an apology. Wow. Never checked on us once during the meal. We were done eating and watched the waitress eating pizza behind the bar while we sat for 15 more minutes waiting to get our bill.  I have waitressed for 16 years. Usually tip 20 to 25%.  Left her 0 on debit. she was complaining as she walked away all the while not knowing if I was going to leave cash.  See you never know who your customer may be.  Her loss. Maybe she should chose another career because she sucks at waitressing.
2308;just got some take out ordered their four pack of wings four different sauces and some celery and carrot sticks DISAPPOINTED had to get home to find out two of the packs were sauced and in truth were very good. however two of the packs had NO SAUCE whatsoever and one of them was clearly burnt . to add insult to injury 4 pounds of wings comes with six celery sticks and 8 carrot sticks with four small blue cheese dips . Are your Fking kidding me for $50 I expect a lot more The one star was because the two that were sauced were OK
2309;Really bad food. Sticky tables. Jalapeño poppers were horrible, you can tell they were frozen and fried. Mozzarella sticks weren't any better. The wings were just ok.  Over battered and over fried. The best part of my meal was the Pepsi. Service was the only part that was good.
2310;This review is for the owner/manager.Been a big fan and long time customer at your restaurant. Never had a complaint about food or service before. In the last 3 weeks, my fiancé and I have been to your restaurant twice. While the food was fine, the service was just garbage. There's a new waitress (older, brunette, long ponytail,maybe eastern-European?) who's been behind the bar. For more than an hour, other than myself seating myself and her delivering a menu, she's never heard from or seen again. The first time I came, my wings came out more than 45 minutes after ordering and they were cold because she just stood at the bar talking with other guys (not doing anything work related). Second time was last night - while food came out, for over an hour, she never came back to check on us, provide us with refills, or even a bill or container for food! I had to go to the bar and pay for my bill and left my food. Not my intention to throw anyone under a bus or get someone canned, but if you want loyalty from c
2311;Worst service, didnt even bother to ask if we wanted our wings breaded or what kind of sauce we wanted. Super rude waitress with RBFS.. not recommended.
2312;We got the Tuesday special which is 1.5 lbs of wings with a purchase of a drink for 10.99. We also got a poutine. Right now, it's been 40 minutes since we ordered and have not got our order. There's a table that came in 20 minutes after us and is almost finished their meal. It's not even half full in the restaurant right now. I am "hangry".
2313;By far one of the cheapest Subways franchise locations- it's cheap lettuce topping- PUT MORE ON. I just don't understand franchise locations that decide they will put little to no veggies on for the sake of saving a few cents. I hate locations that do this and rely on the franchise name to keep them in business.There's no reason why I should be eating so much subway- but after visiting 3 different locations in 1 week I was actually insulted at how little veggies they gave me, even AFTER I asked for "a lot" and "more".I literally had to scoop out the veggies on one side of my footling to put on the OTHER side of my sandwich to enjoy it. Then took the other half of my sandwich home and added more veggies.(PS: I worked at subway when I was teenager- I know what a reasonable amount of toppings are).
2314;The customer service in this specific store is abysmal and it should be avoided at all costs! More than once I've gone into an empty store at this location - as I did today - to have the staff tell me they'd be with me momentarily, then take minutes before they actually approach the counter. Today was the final straw, however. When the staff person finally came to take my order, after I waited for 2-3 minutes while she fussed around in the back, I asked for a specific slice to have her grab another slice. When I asked again for the specific slice, she began to argue with me, stating that they were the same and it didn't matter. I reiterated I wanted the slice I wanted and as I was paying for it, why was she arguing with me about it. She then gave me a dirty look, grabbed the slice and tossed it into the oven, all the while continuing to argue with me, and added that I was making a big deal about nothing. I told her not to bother, that I would walk to the next block where there's a Pizzaiolo and have their sli
2315;I don't mind a pizza that is made well. Not sure how you call it pizza really. It tastes disgusting. A nice way to compliment the attitude of the staff.
2316;Oh dear.Where do I begin.The fact that we paid for sweet potato fries, then our server April printed out another receipt (not ours) and accused me of lying.She remembered me asking for them so she kindly snatched our regular fries out of my hands and exasperatedly chucked them into the bin with the flair of a figure skater.I then waited five minutes for what we had ordered and paid for.She handed me the fries but not the spicy mayo.I asked for it and she distractedly handed it to me.Being tight on time, my boyfriend and I headed back to the car and were munching on the fries on the way back to work.They were SOGGY.So gross. The worst sweet potato fries I've had from A & W's.Ever.She gave us the wrong burger which I realized much later (didn't have time to switch it, didn't really care, it was still good).If you're in Vaughan Mills and NEED an A & W's fix, stick to the burgs and not the fries.Make sure you check your order, she messed up on the one before me and after me....Just so distracted!!!
2317;As some of you may know, I am huge fan of A&Ws, so it pains me to have to give this particular location only a single star. This A&Ws is located in Vaughn Mills inside the food court area. I was pretty excited to use my coupons to get either two mozza burger or two teen burger combos with my date. Before you say anything, you should acknowledge the fact that A&Ws is a step up from McDonalds price wise. Anyway, we decided to order two mozza burger combos, with root beer, and one combo with sweet potato pries instead of regular fries. We sit down at our table and look inside the bag. To our disappointment, we didn't get our spicy potato fries (which cost extra btw). So my hot date generously offers to go back and tell them what happened. While she is doing all this I discover that I got a teen burger instead of a mozza burger. LOL   Our time was wasted during this whole ordeal so we had to go, but I would have been too lazy to complain regardless. Not worth the hassle nor the risk of getting the wrong burger 
2318;The service is horrible. We sat down and waited for someone to greet us. Server handed us the menus and walked away. When she came to take our order she stood over the table and just looked at us like we were supposed to know we should have been ready. Everything time we asked for something she had to check if they had it and most of the time there was nothing available. She seemed so put out that she had to check the kitchen each time.  We order tasteless empanadas, once filled with hot sauce it was meh. They completely forgot my order and my friends were practically done there meals before mine even arrived. The beans were drowning in water and  made the rice soggy. And when they brought the they spilled the bean juice all over the floor and my leg. Honestly this place was just shitty in all aspects
2319;Yesterday afternoon we went to eat at this restaurant my friend, her husband, my husband and I as we have repeatedly been. My friend order encebollado, her husband order a plate that had beans, rice, and a steak the dish was cold and he asked the waitress to warm it a little, she went and told the lady in the kitchen which is the owner of las fronteras and she heat it up too much, he could not eated until it cooled a bit. My husband ordered la jalea which was old and rare as we gave to try our friends to see what they felt and thought the same as us, so we called the waitress back and told her that la jalea was old and weird, she grabbed the plate and went to the kitchen where the owner was, the waitress told the owner that we did not want la jalea because it was old (we heard everything from the table where we were sitting) the owner left the kitchen grabbed are bill and brought to us to the table instead of her apologizing for la jalea was old and tasted rare, insted she started screaming at us in front of 
2320;I'm dying..... Oh man.....Dont try the new crunchy stuffed crust.....Not sure if it was "that" pizza or something they put in it....3 hours in washroom...Arghhh
2321;Absolutely the worst experience ever. Went with my daughter. Stood waiting for a table for ten minutes with nobody coming up and the place was empty. There was a waitress with a crying baby in the kitchen who was ignoring us. I ask twice at takeout window for help but was ignored. Skip this place!
2322;Worst customer service!. The guy taking my order actually took a personal call on his cell phone and had me waiting to place my order.
2323;Worst customer service.  They couldn't even get my phone number right.  Pizza order was wrong and they told me it was my fault.   Pizza sucked. Service sucked.  Never going back
2324;I've been here a few times and was disappointed every time. Food is expensive for what you get and for the quality too.Will not come here anymore.
2325;Now I understand why the food is only so so.Start with a massive pot, throw in ingredients and probably cook till just ready. Package in single serve freezer bags and ship out to stores. That way, even toy can own a franchise.
2326;I've been here a few times and I usually know what to expect...average but somewhat satisfying Carribbian food. Today I was disappointed. The curried chicken roti was terrible..the roti shell is different than what they've had in the past, less authentic than before. The curry part of the roti didn't have a great flavor either..all around disappointing for an expensive fast food dinner
2327;This has to be the worst take out experience i have ever had in my life. Ever.The food was horrible. Words cannot describe how bad it was. Items not even close to their description. Beef that chewed like leather and was clearly old. Protein portions that were embarrassing. Musty flavours. Ingredients that were not just old, but mushy. Things deep fried in oil reused so many times it turned the dish black. I have never wishes a business go out of business. But this is a diservice to the world. Shit on a tray is exactly what it is. I had to throw out my entire order.
2328;Oh NOOOOOOO! I hate giving a one star, but in this instance I have no choice. I am all about helping the little guys compete on the big food scale but if you're going to compete, ya gotta bring your A-game fella. No one is going to let you into the Stanley Cup Finals for just being a nice team, you have to play hard and earn your spot like everyone else. So lets be clear on that Oak RIdges Asian Deli, I don't hate you, let's use this review as your mid term report card and take what I say as constructive criticism. This was a take-a-way experience that we should have run-a-way from, the writing (and the dirt) was on the wall (and everywhere else too). My simple feeling is that if you are paying for food from a restaurant, it's because you want a break at the end of your week from cooking and you trust that said restaurant is going to cook things better and more delicious than you yourself ever could. This is why when food is not prepared properly or prepared at all, there really is no excuse because you a
2329;Ugh this place. So a few weeks ago I was super sick and I wanted some soup, so I looked online at this was the only place available around me to deliver, so I figured it can't be that bad and I ordered.I got a medium hot and sour soup, and chicken wings to round up the order for delivery.I was told the delivery would take 45 mins, and it took about 2 hours...even though this location is about 5 mins away from my house. So the soup was delivered stone cold and was basically inedible. I didn't even have more than like three sips of this. The Chicken Wings were flavourless and covered in like a thick breading. It came with fries which were standard fare I guess.I'd advise you to just go somewhere else. There's other better places in the area.Also, what's an Asian Deli?
2330;I normally don't write reviews but people need to save their tastebuds and monies from this place! I'd give less stars if I could. Went here for the first time because it's pretty close where we live and this plaza is jam packed with lots of other food places that we're pretty tired of, so we decided to try the chicken here. We got the 9pc with large coleslaw and the jalapeño cheese sauce as takeout. Pros: Halal Close to usSeemingly new, bright looking restaurant Cons: Service- not only did the girl at the counter mess up the order, she forgot our sauces we paid extra for (which are a total fail, the taste is meh and the consistency of the sauces is weird too, I'd recommend not paying the extra 50c for them). We also ordered the large coleslaw but she forgot to pack it and had to go back to get it despite the receipt stating the full order. Maybe she's new but she wasn't really enthused at us telling her she forgot our coleslaw. I mean, own it, at least.Horrible fried chicken. Ugh we got the 9pc a
2331;Not your typical fried chicken place. And I really mean not typical. Because it's below typical.The chicken was small, not so crunchy, and tasted strange.If you haven't noticed already, if you compare the price for the Friday 2 pc deal and the regular price for 2 pc chicken.. it isn't a deal. The price is the same lol.Haven't tried their nuggets or popcorn chicken, but so far the chicken disappointed too much for us to say let's go back and try their other stuff.
2332;"Chunky" Chicken? Oh the irony!FOOD:The chicken was anything but Chunky! i ordered a quarter chicken peri peri, and i felt bad for the chicken and it probably felt bad for my stomach. The leg piece looked like it came out of a chick and not a fully grown chicken. I had to get another quarter leg to quench my appetite. The taste, well it is spicy but i wouldn't call it tasty. Coz like, you can make better chicken legs in a toaster oven with your own spices.Environment:They have clearly spent a lot of money on it, but it looks rather cheaply designed or rather off taste as somebody else pointed out. The colour combination, the high ceiling, the unused space, bright white lights, doesn't make for a place that is comfortable for eating.If you want to get authentic peri peri, just go to nandos or  Los Chicos.Sorry Chunky Chicken, i really wanted to like you.
2333;Never recommenced this place to any one. -I requested them to serve fresh fried food but they served cold chicken and on enquiring they insisted that its fresh fried. Blunt lie!-Soft drink was actually warm and on request to provide ice they refused-Food taste crappy-There were no napkins available (lolss ... a basic thing)-With several better fried chicken options in Markham there is no point paying same price for tasteless food and poor serviceSuggestion to Chunky Chicken: I understand its a newly launched outlet therefore a rule of thumb is to provide better quality food and nice customer service if you guys wanna remain in business in competitive market.
2334;I came today to get 2 pizzas for my kids' lunch.  I got there at 11.50am, they open at 11.30am.  I asked for two 7" pizzas.  The server goes to ask one of the cooks, if they have any.  He says no, they only have 12" dough and the dough maker ain't coming to work till later.  HELLO? WTH? Why can't you use the dough you do have and serve customers that are in the store?  You could have even split one dough to make me the 2 pizzas.Such a shame because I like their UK style pizzas but the place is run by a bunch of muppets.
2335;One word, disgusting, food is, service is. People that works there simply doesn't care,  don't waste your time, just go to KFC or Popeye's instead
2336;Nothing like the Chipotle in the US. The tortilla was cold, the chicken was very dry and had some charred parts, the salsa was very watery and make my burrito soggy. There are better options in the food court, or better yet, burrito boyz down the street.
2337;Cheap with the meat! And their burrito fell out twice... Worst chipotle experience ever
2338;Bad bad ! They offer also kids menu but they dont have appropriate trays for that and the offerme served it in a regular bowl where is not appetitive for a children everything together. My kids didn't ate because didn't look delicious to a kid eye. It is not according what the franchise offers.
2339;DO NOT EAT HERE, I got the worst FOOD POISONING I've ever had. I would rate zero stars if I could. I had a burritto bowl here last night with steak and pulled pork and in the middle of the night I woke up puking and having diarrhea at the same time. I'm certain I got food poisoning from Chipotle as it's the only meal I ate differently from my family yesterday. I've literally been spewing from both ends at the same time, no exaggeration. I won't be going back to any Chipotles ever again.
2340;Two friends and I ate here last week and all three of us had mild food poisoning the next morning. Will not be returning.
2341;While the new food court at Sherway is as beautiful as the rest of the mall, this particular Chipotle fell very short.I was there on a weekday during lunch and I was starving so I figured Chipotle never fails.  Anyway, I ordered the Barbacoa Burrito ($8.95) with Guacamole (additional $2.21).  It was room temperature, messy, salty and definitely not worth the $12.61 I paid.  Service was friendly but staff seemed very inexperienced they were moving people quicker along than they had to.  They were pouring on all types of watery sauces on other people's burritos - as if these people planned to wear their food rather than eating it.I ended up cutting it in half and offering my colleague the other half but he thought is looked gross - not like what you would get at a Chipotle downtown.Burrito Boyz on The Queensway is 100% better (and less expensive).BTW, CASH ONLY or credit card.
2342;Since mgmt too over this place has deteriorated in zero customer service & terrible quality food! Avoid this location at all costs unless you want all night bathroom visits! My daughter & I ate there & was sick all night! Contacted mgmt & zero response! Maybe they are too busy sponsoring the leafs because customer service isn't as an exciting of a priority! Too many burger options to ever go back to Heros again! Try Hwy55 on Trafalgar S of QEW - awesome burgers + much better burgers at The Works in downtown Oakville, or South Street Burgers just west of this location! Or even Harpers Landing! Boycott Hero Burgers! One star rating only because I had to too! Zero stars is more appropriate!
2343;The official hamburger of the Toronto Make-beliefs.  And to put this chain on Elmwood Avenue in Buffalo.  Ha.  I will eat no hero burgers.  Ooh. Ahh.
2344;After corporate staff took over, and in their transition, to new staff, their fries and their burgers are horribly made. I gave them two chances and they failed both times. I ordered a 6oz burger combo take out. By the time I got to my car, the burger was "luke warm" almost cold. The fries were not cooked like before. Miss the Indian lady who ran that shop. I wont' be going back. I'm going to South Street instead.
2345;This location has cockroaches. My first and last time visiting this location. I should have taken a picture but I was frozen with disgust when I saw it crawling around.
2346;Line long food smaller portion than MCD. Washroom is filthy. CSR took wrong orders and mgr argued but eventually except his mistake. Won't ever go to all Harvey's again
2347;I'm not one to complain , but I went there today ordered a crispy chicken sandwich when it came time to tell my toppings I saw a BBQ chicken. I told the server  tried to prusuade me into taking the bbq chicken I let her know I don't like BBQ sauce, that's when she developed a attitude when I got my order I asked for a little bit of siracha sauce , she poured out alot of siracha sauce. I like my food spicy but not that spicy When I went to my car go eat the burger the chicken patty was beyond dry and tasted like it was freezer burnt. I couldn't eat the burger it was inedible and the meat patty was not only dry but hard.
2348;A hidden bubbletea shop in between a chinese resturant and a convenience store. on Enterprise and Birchmount. I thought I'd give this place a try. I ordered a milk tea with tapioca to-go half sweet. When my order came out I was surprised!. Although the store was called "little honey tea shop"  they still seem to use Teashop 168's take-out cups... only managed to put a sticker over the cups (talk about cheap).... Branding aside. The bubble tea was horrific a bit worse than the varieties you would buy at Foodymart or a random chinese resturant that tries to expand their buseiness by making lousy bubble teas. If I could give this place a grade I'd give it an "F"Atmosphere: Looks exactly like what it is , small and cleanFood/Drink: powdery and watered down...I wish I spent the extra two bucks to go to chatime across the street or the aromahonestly A LOT OF WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE.
2349;A brand new open place that needs lots lots lots lots more dedication and work to improve.The price was relatively low but not worth a second try or maybe regretting after seeing the bowl of noodle arriving. Location: parking was a bit difficult as it's just limited and one way direction. Setting: typically plain and cleanPrice: average low, food quantity was extra small Taste: bubble tea tasted water down and tapioca is over cooked. Noodle and soup was not their strength. The intention for the Cafe was "cart noodle" where noodles are supposed to be served in speed and go-go-go tempo. However this didn't happen, maybe of slower customer flow that requires time to reheat the side dishes.
2350;Came here on an evening stumbled upon this business who took over the former teashop 168. Atmosphere: Dead the workers/owners were on their phones looking very unproductive. Ordered two milk teas/no ice and curry fish/beef balls... I can honestly say the quality was the worst I had ever tasted not only relativity to bubble tea and snacks but to food in general. This is the kind of food and drinks they would feed inmates in Guantanamo Bay! The curry fish balls and curry beef balls were not edible and tasted rancid as if they were sitting out for weeks, while the two large milk teas I ordered were tasteless and served piping-hot. This was without a doubt the worst experiences I've had at one of your establishments the food quality is questionable and I may consider contacting Public health inspection (York Safe)- extremely disappointed and jaded ( I cant drink bbt anymore)
2351;I believe this restaurant is only open to run drugs of some sort. It never has anyone but druggies around and really brings the area down. Licks definitely didn't close due to this competition.
2352;avoid at all costs.a shit hole ,druggies,and drunks lingering about this place.it used to be a great place back in 1965,66.
2353;Got really bad runs. Food is not great but very cheap. Hope its real. A drunks heaven.
2354;Absolute worse customer service. I called and the person who answered the phone did noy speak english. They have a live chat, but I wanted to speak to someone in person. They provided me with a 1-877 number which was not in service. I just wanted to ask a couple of questions and was not comfortable giving my Visa. What happened to live customer service?
2355;I am visiting from the states and decided to stop here for food with my fiancé. We received the worst customer service. They didn't come to the counter to take our order until we asked their unattended children in the dining area if anyone was there to help us and the little girl. They charged my card for our order and then told us they wouldn't make us the food because it was an American card and they don't like American cards and refused to give me a refund. I had been using my American card here all week long with no issues. They had the audacity to ask me to write down my card number for them so they could issue the refund later. After 20 minutes of arguing with them, and the husband and wife berating each other in Chinese they finally remembered how to give a refund. If I could give this restaurant less stars than one I would, and I didn't even get to try to food. My advice would be to eat literally anywhere else besides here.
2356;We had a reservation for 20 people for a birthday party for 8:30 booked in advance. We got there at 8:30 to find they gave our table away because they "had a line." What a joke. If you take a reservation,  honor it. What an excuse for management. We ended up being accommodated at Fox and the Fiddle up the street and we're happy to give them our business.
2357;The most horrible food I ever tried Wings weren't fresh but i ate fewI got sick that night and vomit to morning I am highly recommend to avoid this place
2358;Do me a favour, never dine here! Horrible service and food. I got a hair (short and curly) the total opposite of mine. I notified the server and she looked at me as if I was joking, putting my own hair. (Seriously?). Anyways the burger was remade but no bill deduction. I came here months after to give it a second chance... no change. Service and food is disgusting. Unexplainable.
2359;Have gone to the St. Louis at York Mills and the one near Yonge Finch for years.  Never had any issues.  Am sitting here at the one on Dufferin where I ordered a mandarin chicken salad and my husband got a buffalo Caesar wrap.  Not only did the food take an exceptionally long time to arrive, (there were only about 6 other people who ordered after us) but the portions were off.  There were barely any fries on the wrap plate and barely any dressing on the salad.  I mentioned it to the waitress who said different locations do different portions.  Not acceptable.  She ended up having the fries topped off for my husband.  Won't come here again, sticking to the other locations.
2360;Worst restaurant manager of all St. Louis locations... By far impolite, no welcoming attitude and for sure do NOT care about customer satisfaction, think he is not even aware of the term!!!!! Unable to accomodate customers with the simplest request of putting 2 tables together, just 2 tables not the walls... U hear me?!! Awful Waitresses are very nice though don't get me wrong
2361;I usually don't write reviews, but I recently had a terrible experience. I went there with my pregnant wife and we asked for a booth, the hostess said they didn't have any available and brought us to a little table that didn't provide enough room. I looked around and noticed 2 booths available, I asked the hostess and she said it's against company policy to seat us at either booth. Pretty terrible way to treat a guest, let alone a pregnant one. I would not recommend this place.
2362;I don't even want to rate 1 star to this restaurant!!! Horrible management. I witnessed an extremely horrible scene when I went there for a nice dinner with my husband. The manager insulted a group of people for not having space for them! And the worst part was the manager showed finger to the eldest person of the group!!!! Can you imagine?? I left the place and will never go back. (If the group want to use me as a witness I'm always ready, if I was in their place I would have called the cops!)
2363;this place is terrible!!!the service sucks, and the staff and "management"  are rude!it took the waitress 15 minutes to come and check on us. when we asked for a drink, she just never came back so we had to make our way to the bar ourselves.We complained about the service to the "manager", a weird looking guy came .  He was very unproffessional in my opinion.  He didnt even apologize, let alone offer something for the inconvinience. this place is officially banned on my list. im suprized they are still in business!!!
2364;Me and my friends used to visit the pub frequently because of the close distance and every time told to myself not to come back again.The food not bad, but the owner of the pub is complete jerk.He has no clue what a good customer service means.A few times  a couple of unexpected friends wanted to join our full table, so  we asked for a couple of chairs to add to the table,or just  to move to bigger table, but the owner refused. He did have a bigger tables that weren't reserved, also free chairs, but  for some reason, he didn't want to do it for us, mentioned , that we are troublemakers ??? We always order wings, calamari, beer, appetizers and deserts. Every bill we pay is at least  $35-$40 per person, sohe should be happy to have more customers, but he is not....Last time the bill had an additional charge of $5 per person for the UFC event. I asked to remove it, cause nobody told us in advance about that charge. Owner agreed to remove it only if we are not coming back to his pub anymore....Until the o
2365;Absolutely horrible service. We waited over 15 mins to even get offered a drink or food. It continued like that throughout the meal. I will not o back.
2366;We went in a group of 15 and was declined a table, although there was availability, on a Tuesday half off wings night.  We were told the large table would affect their turn over rate with smaller tables by the owner.What an outrageous way of running a biz.  The last time we were there our bill came to almost $700 with only 8 of us.  We drink like fishes even though we won't eat a lot.We ended up going to another place and spent over $1000.We complained to head office and since it's a franchise they can't do anything but warn the owner.The owner of this location is absolutely rude!  One time a waitress gave me somebody's bill, as they claimed as an error, and if I did not check I could've paid double.  Made a complaint but had no reply from them at all.Will never come to this location again!!!
2367;I try to avoid this location but being so close to home sometimes it's just more convenient.  The attitude on these employees is too much. They are rude when you are trying to place your order in drive thru, they are always speaking another language and ignoring the customer and I swear they probably do it on purpose because 9 times out of 10 they get my order wrong!
2368;I've visited this location several times now, mostly it was ordering at the drive through. On a good day I can get my order quick as there is no other vehicle in front of me, but more times then not there is quite a line up. A couple of days ago I saw the line up and said "Hell no..." so me being the genius figured maybe ordering inside the store would be faster. When I got inside the store there was only one other customer a head of me, I don't know how long she was there for but I suspect it was long enough, to raise her voice and say "can we get some service please!" bare in my mind why I went in to begin with, the long line up of cars outside. To be fair this is normal for businesses to not have enough staffing, nothing I haven't seen before. Anyways when it was my turn I placed my order, the whole time I was watching this younger worker, maybe in his teens I guess, no name tag not even the "in training" one, shirt looked crisp like it was his first time wearing it, not to say it was, he was learning 
2369;We went through a short dance about the hostess "finding a table". Since he had my mother in law with us, I took the liberty of pointing out the empty tables to the hostess. They were clearly visible although the restaurant was busy. Others were "waiting for a table", but I think that this is the M.O. here, to promote a kind of exclusivity.The orders were taken after about 10 minutes, and the marathon wait started. First we waited a few minutes for the bread. Then  waited a few more minutes for the salad. And then the wait began, and went on and on.I had ordered a make your own pasta with Fettuccine, Arrabiata Sauce and Shrimps. My wife ordered Salad and Wedding Soup. My mother in law ordered a baked concoction of pasta shells gummied up with a sauce of sorts.We had to hail several of the wait staff as the marathon wait was going on. Things started coming after more than 45 minutes, not including the previous wait time. Soup came without a spoon. Salad was served put not parmesan offered, etc. It was a 
2370;Worest resturant service EVER!!We went for Mother's Day taking mom and our friends mom. We waited from 6:30 to 9:00 to get our main course!! That should be in Guinness record!! The waiter her name is Casandra!! Missed up our order, she came after 15min asking us to repeat the order! Salad and soup took so long to come! Oh my good ot was really horrible experience. Manger only gave us 10% for our order for the delay which was not pleasent (-10$) from the bill doesnt worth waiting that much!!The manager should make it up to us, and should think of hiring more people. We came to celebrate and enjoy our time, but it was tottally the oppsite, it was frustrating and the food took about 2hrs and a half to come and we couldnt eat it!!Dont go to this branch you will defently regret it!!
2371;We came in, waited over an hour at the table no bread, no food. We did get salad. Must have been 80 degrees in there manager claims one hour earlier it was freezing. Lady at the table next to us told us she'd been there for an hour and that wasn't true. Finally requested food to go (toddler antsy after waiting so long, plus it was after 8p) and the waitress asked how everything was going. My response, horrible. Her, I know. 75 minutes in and finally part of our to go offer is here. Anyways, the manager finally expedited our food to go and took 50% off the bill, but as we finish our dinner in a hotel room can't say I'd recommend the experience
2372;Never come back!!Worse service, worse food.The rice is undercooked, mussels are rubbery... Just one comment, my  homecooking is better than this!They claimed to give u a free take out with a purchase of certain dish, they never come. Even I've asked, they pretended never happened because you have paid your bill!For a hundred dollars meal for my family,  I rather buy few steaks or salmon to cook at home.Worse come to worse, their funnel cake is garbage.I never write any comments in my life but I must today.I regreted never check this app before I go!!I hope you won't be the next victim!
2373;This place has steadily declined in quality that it has become a shell of its former self from the three times I have visited (counting the most recent). With the sign outside alleging the establishment was under new management I figured things may have turned around and was worth a shot, unfortunately that is not the case. In fact, it is baffling that during my third and most recent visit it was busy, only to be dismayed in the quality of the food. Bottom line, the food they cooked was inconsistent, which can only spell a deeper systemic problem for the restaurant. For the meal, I ordered the Italian wedding soup and Riso Italiano. The soup itself was too salty with both the lentils and meatball too mushy or soft to feel right as though it was either under-cooked or left to warm for too long. As for the Riso Italiano, it's actually embarrassing to think they could've messed up cooking rice but they did, the rice was under-cooked or hard (grit like even) and the chicken was severely shrunken as if blasted by
2374;Waited for an hour...for salad. When the food came an hour and half later, the chicken for the kids meals was as hard a rock. The temperature inside was hotter than outside! There's a reason why this restaurant has only 2 stars!
2375;Walked in as a family of four, the manager was at the front door when we did and told us that they are cleaning a table and it will be couple of minutes. Fifteen minutes later I'm staring at three large empty table yet we are not being seated. So he walks up and I ask him "you have these entry tables yet we are standing here waiting" to which he replied "I have a party of 50 coming in".Obviously I was not happy about this and told him that's not what he told me when we walked in, had he told me it will be a while I would have not waited since I was in a hurry and could not wait. Instead of apologizing about his screwup, he takes a tone telling me that's too bad and he's waiting for a booth to clear up so he seat us. Yeah right, I want to wait who knows how much longer and eat at an establishment that has no clue what customer service is and how to talk to a customer. I would rate this place zero stars if I could.
2376;Terrible!! Food was awful. Cold Saw a server drop a loaf of bread and pic it up and reserve it. If your looking for a quick meal joeys markville is a way better options
2377;Awful awful awful... My boyfriend and I entered the restaurant, starving and eager to eat. This is 2pm on a Friday afternoon, the restaurant wasn't busy with only 2 other patrons eating. The waitress ignored us for 10 minutes before begrudgingly seating us. There was no "hi, sorry for the wait" just leaving the menus in a pile at the table. If possible, this restaurant wouldn't get any stars, and needless to say we walked out without eating.
2378;Came here for dinner with my son. He ordered chicken fingers and I got base filet. Had to send my fish back it tasted and smelled really bad. Son could not eat his chicken fingers. Everything tasted stale.  Took the chicken home for the dogs they would not eat it either. Don't wast your time coming here.  Quality of the food and service are bad!!!  I would give it a no star rating if I could!
2379;Summary: they make unlimited garlic bread and Caesar salad feel very, very limited when they have only one server during a lunch rush - food quality was never a strength here, and looks like food QUANTITY has nosedived as well.Top Must-Get: a SCENE points cardTop Regret: unlimited caesar saladI don't blame the server. I really don't. The manager that decided to staff one server during lunchtime? Insane. When four colleagues and myself got here for our lunch meeting, we were one of two tables. We got served pretty quickly, and the server kindly accommodated us when we asked to move to a bigger table, and took our order fairly quickly. But other folks started coming - and before you knew it, there were about 10 tables. Three of my colleagues ordered the unlimited caesar salad. They got their first set about 20 minutes in (a SALAD... I mean, in that time, I think it would've been faster to walk to Wal-mart, buy the ingredients, and make it ourselves at someone's house). Naturally, then, my spaghetti and
2380;We bought the wagjag deal, which you can only use Monday - Thursday.Decided to come here on wednesday for early dinner 4:40pm, at this hour, there shouldn't be any problem right.. WRONG!!No one at the reception area.. waited 5mins, i went and told the bartender girl, to call someone.  5 more mins go past.  I went to the back and asked someone else. My problem is the place is empty and i had to wait almost 10mins for someone to come greet us and seat us.I believe the manager was the one who greeted us and apologized and warned us that its shift change, so the service may be a bit slow.I personally think that they are very understaffed.5-6 occupied tables should not be enough to slow service down during a shift change.Bread came very slow.  I could see that the manager was trying to make up for under staff situation by running around doing everything.  He was polite and friendly but the service wasn't there.  He gave me the salad and my wife the soup, its the other way around. He later asked me if i wan
2381;East side Mario's, east side Mario's, eh bada boom bada FAIL! This place does one thing great. They are the cheapest, least authentic way to eat Italian. All you can eat salad and bread included with your meal. Does that say something to you? Sure does to me. Kids eat free? I wonder why. Being Italian and getting dragged here by friends, I got the least Italian thing on the menu to save my taste buds. The salmon with veggies. You'd think, how could they mess up a piece of fish right? Wrong. They did. My salmon came out still frozen in the centre and was FULL of bones. Inedible. Told the manager working, he replaced it. +1 star. The end. See you never again Mario!
2382;This is truly a mixed experience that requires the review to be done in three parts. Front/Food/ServerSeating-Is there any negative star????There were two total incompetent hostesses that was pacing and walking around the restaurant aimlessly.  No smile, no greeting, just walking around!!!   They are chatting and walking together????   The front waiting area was full of people BUT the inside seating area had THIRTEEN empty tables????   And the hostess had no interest in seating people.  They kept us standing for over 15 mins when half the restaurant was empty.....Food- the stuffed pizza (a bit small for a $15 price) and Chicken and Veal Parmesan was decent.  Not great but decent.  The kitchen was quite quick in preparing the food and hence not a long wait after the order was placed.  Temperature was good and it was tasty.  The soup and salad was quite good-especially when you factor in its all you can eat.  I would give it a 3 star here.The server was also quite good-prompt and polite.   Despite being 
2383;Worst service ever. My boyfriend and I love the East Side Mario's Franchise, but this is the worst one we have ever been to. Ryan, the bartender, is absolutely terrible. Did not check on us once, demanded for payment right away, and forgot half of our orders for all you can eat soup. Never asked us if we wanted another drink, nor if we wanted dessert. Extremely disappointed. If you come here, do not eat in the bar area!
2384;Wait staff was great. Started with Salad on my last bite found a piece of wax paper.  They brought out the rest of our food, after we finished eating slightly burnt pizza and pasta. Server apologized and asked if I wanted to talk to manager.  I asked the Server to let the manager know.  She came back and told me the manager apologizes and gave me the bill.  I asked if she let the manager know about the wax paper and she replied again we apologize and that's all we can do.  The wax paper was a turn off and the manager could have apologized in person.  Will not go back again.
2385;Seriously they need customer service training. First problem: They refused to offer free kid meal (Mon to Wed) with a $10 off coupon card that they accepted last week. Manager dropped by only admitted it was a mistake.Second problem: the server kept educating us their policy. I asked if a kid drink was refillable. She said no.  Added only pop is. Came back with an apple juice  that we paid for and told us again: pop is refillable, not milk and not juice.  Overall experience was unwelcome.  Often time when she could not understand my request, her immediate reply was "What?"This will likely my last visit.
2386;Don't come here on a Wednesday unless you want to be surrounded by misbehaving children and have terrible service. I have never had such a stressful dining experience. Then the manager has the audacity to suggest that I sit in the bar. I don't want to sit in the effing bar unless I'm drinking. Sitting in the bar means bad service unless you're drinking and then it's usually bad service.
2387;Terrible service, made us wait for 30 minutes before seating us at tables without cutlery or plates. The food was served before cutlery and we weren't given any until asked. All you can eat bread and salad was never restocked even after asking twice. Food was below par, greasy and un appetizing. No one bothered to come around with the cheque for the longest time possible. Don't bother coming here unless you are really hungry and there's no food for miles. Would have given negative stars if possible.
2388;Went after work for quick bite and upon entering no host/hostess. Waited 5 mins & when someone finally came we were ignored.  Hostess a little lost, finally got to table, great waitress. I ordered the wrong thing...stay away from pepperonata steak and pasta.  Pasta was ok but steak was flavourless & very poor quality meat. Salad & bread great & calamari diabolo and old favourite.  Will not go for awhile.
2389;Horrible service and the restaurant owner is even worst. We ordered one soup/salad and chicken, after long time they came back saying no half chicken only quarter available. My wife asked for another salad refill but they refused. Restaurant owner shows up careless so we left and we will never come back.......
2390;Never been to east side marios before so my boyfriend and I thought we should give it a try tonight. It was very empty when we walked in at 9pm and got a seat right away.We ended up sitting there for 30 minutes trying to flag down someone to come take our order. No one came by to ask us what we wanted to drink or if we were ready to order. The place was very empty and there were probably 2-3 other families there at the time. If the staff had enough time to put plates on an empty table they had the time to come see how we were doing.After waiting a little more we noticed that the family that got here after us got their food and we still haven't been able to order. We decided to just get up and leave. Very disappointing first experience.The inside pages of the menu were also very wet and sticky. Please check to make sure they are dry before giving it to a customer. Very disappointing first experience. We decided to go to Milestones for pasta instead.
2391;When we arrived there was no one at the hostess station and we waited a long time for someone to come over and seat us. When we were finally seated we waited a long time for someone to take our order even though we saw servers. After the waitress finally took our order she left abruptly without asking if we prefer the soup or salad. When she brought the drinks over we asked why the complimentary bread and soup or salad wasn't included. She said that it was and she forgot it was included with the meals. How can she take orders all the time and forget its included. We waited a long time for our food to arrive and had two loaves of bread which were both way over cooked and not edible. My pasta tasted like hospital food. We wanted dessert but didn't order it because we wanted to leave as soon as possible because of the service and the quality of the food. I've been to other East Side Marios which were much better.
2392;If you are planning to eat at this location... forget about it! Worst service and the so called  chef burnt my food and still had it served to me
2393;One of the worst customer service experiences - ever. I will not be going back and neither will the three adults who were with me. Let me start by saying that previous experiences have been mediocre but the service has been declining - and now to a new low. We arrived at 6 p.m. with two toddlers and (thankfully) ordered their food as we sat down. They children's food came 10 minutes later and that was the end of anything that could be remotely classified as "service".  We sat for over 30 minutes waiting to place our orders and place drink orders for the two adults who joined us 5 minutes after we sat down. Our waitress had completely disappeared so I asked the manager who was passing by if he could retrieve someone to place our to order, to which he replied "yeah, yeah, yeah" while not slowing as he walked away. Then, nothing. Ten minutes later we flagged down another waitress who told us to hold on and then returned saying there was an issue with the waitress and she would serve us. She was obviously annoy
2394;Terrible experience. Made a reservation for 16 people and regret doing so. This is the 3rd time we have had an awful experience at this location. The food is always pretty good, however the service absolutely obliterates any chances of this place succeeding. Our server was not only beyond rude and dismissive, but she made several mistakes with no apology. As a group of 16, we didn't expect to have fast service, but a bit of attention isn't asking much. My salad had plenty of withered/rotting leaves to top it off. The manager is a dismissive jerk who has no clue/knowledge of how to run a busy restaurant. He's absolutely so rude. Won't be hurrying back again.
2395;I'm not a fan of East Side Mario's but my boyfriend is so we end up here quite often. This particular location, however, has to be the worst when it comes to service. It's the location closest to my house so, sadly, we've been here a few times and I think only ONCE have I left feeling like I didn't have to complain about the service in one way or another... stay away from this particular location, if you can.
2396;Terrible meal and terribly terrible service. Manager has an attitude and the server didn't  seem to care about service at all. The pasta was super dry and had no flavor whatsoever. Swear to never return!!
2397;Service is terrible here! We had to wait over 10 minutes for a table when there are many plenty of tables available because they have to 'set up a table' which involves putting a stack of plates on the table. It takes another 15 minutes before a waitress even comes by. This was on an afternoon when the restaurant wasn't able vendors busy. I'd hate to think what a regular night is like here.
2398;I used to love this place. But so, so, so incredibly terrible now. When we came in, it was so dead and there were only 2 tables. We waited in the front for 5 mins, and the server and bartender made eye contact with me but nobody came to seat us. Then when we sat, the server didn't even greet us just asked if we knew what we wanted. After she was okay, but the food was just mediocre. And she forgot my drink. Manager was nice, but terrible impression of restaurant. Will not be returning ever
2399;It was not a particularly busy night, the bar area was maybe half full. It took at least 30 mins for a server to even acknowledge us and another to 15 to bring water and take our order. A person from our table had to actually get up and ask for our server multiple times before we could even place our order. Overall it took 45 mins to 1 hr to get our order in. Another hour and food did not come. By the end of our visit, it had been about 2 hours and one of the people we were with had to go home. We took our food to-go. They gave us 50% off our meal which was the only nice thing. When I ate the food at home it wasn't even good. It was bland. The customer service: other than the fact that we waited during our entire approx. 2 hour visit, the server did not seem particularly pleased to serve us and only made some small talk about why it took so long when we paid the bill. I can understand that it may be hard to forcast traffic on a particular night for staffing reasons but how does one do SUCH a bad job that cust
2400;Ive been going to other Osmow locations for years and I love their shawarmas and food, however this location serves terrible food and I wouldn't recommend anybody to go there. The food was nasty and my shawarma was falling apart.
2401;I've been to few other osmows around Mississauga/Oakville. Don't come to this location - the food is cold, dried up, and the service is terrible. I ordered a large chicken on the rocks - here is what I got. Compare this to the same order in other locations, Streetsville, Oakville... Etc. They filled a quarter of the box and the size was a small at best. When I asked if they had reduced their portions, they looked lost and seemed to had no idea what I was talking about. Not spending $12 here for lunch when I can elsewhere to get something more and get treated better. What a disappointment - not coming back.
2402;It's going to be hard for them to survive if they don't  give much attention to the kitchen. Please do not use the same towel to dry the kitchen and your hands.
2403;I love Mediterranean cuisine from Israeli to Turkish, Greek, and Lebanese. Went to this place last week to order a chicken shawarma sandwich at 8-8:30 pm and while placing order I was asked multiple times "what?" since staff wasn't listening to me.She told me what the total was and I decided to slide in my card instead of the habit of tapping and I noticed that pin pad display shows about a buck more than what she said. When I asked why, she said "oh, this is the transaction fee when you use credit card" and when I said I could use my debit she said it's the same fee applied!!Usually businesses warn you either verbally prior to the pin pad operation or a message prompts on the pin pad about extra fees. To me this was nothing but stealing from customers and I feel really sad for Sheridan students living in the area that have no choice but complying
2404;The upselling here is ridiculous... I had to say "no" to buying a drink 3 times before I could pay. I ordered a Chicken on the Rocks (large) and I was really underwhelmed with the quantity... I'd expect this little food from a food truck, not a place like Osmow's. I won't be returning to this location - shame, because it's so close to my workplace.
2405;So I was starving after my Moksha Yoga class on a random Sunday afternoon, when I decided to run in here and get myself a cream cheese bagel. The server prepared my toasted bagel while eating a cheesy sandwich. When I looked at her with disgust and shock, she was exceptionally indifferent. She even had the HIDEOUS strand of cheese hanging from her lips when she set the bagel on the counter. Gross.
2406;The only reason why I enter this location is to use the facilities when I am in the neighborhood!  The place consistently smells like a large "facility".  This makes me wonder about the kitchen hygiene.  The 1 star is actually 0.25 star as it is a location that employs people!
2407;Awful is what I can say with my pad Thai. If you had authentic pad thai you can definitely tell the difference. Beef was very tough and the taste was bland. Sorry to say but this place will eventually close down soon.Only good thing was the staff was very friendly.
2408;Soooo undercooked rice. Hard to chew on and tasteless. Not recommended at all. No wonder they were not busy at all.
2409;2 different Sunday's I tried eating at Montana on steeles both times some reason they couldn't serve customers. So we left and went to the one on yonge in Richmond hill. Do your self a favor go to a different location. System errors was one reason and the other sunday they had no hot water??? Who is running this restaurant??? Horrible
2410;HATED it!! I was with a group of under 20 people. We arried and we started ordering we even had numbers to help the serves out.  I had the BBQ chicken fajitas and i got all the things i order but the lettuce was old so i sent it back.  When i returned it was the same.  So i ate and left but i tryed to let the manger know and her responce was we open a new bag!   I was mad and i got her name and i'me going to talk to her boss.  My question is the quality of the product is what i have to wonder!!!    If i could give lower then one i would but i woudl stay away from this place!!  The staff doing give a crap from what i gather from that one night!!
2411;Last night I had dinner with my family at the Steeles & Don Mills Montana's in Toronto. It was the absolute worst experience I've had at a Montana's restaurant. Upon arrival we were seated in a very crowded portion of the restaurant, while the host told us that we were not allowed to sit in the other half of the restaurant. In no way was the area reserved, and when we asked another waitress why this was the case, she replied with "it shouldn't be, but you have to sit with the other diners on that side". We requested to move seats after the back of my seat kept hitting the seat of the person behind me (yes, I was sitting back to back with another guest - it was just that crowded). We sat for approximately 10 minutes and had the opportunity to view our menus and select our drinks, but no server arrived. Only after requesting the hostess to call our server, were we greeted by a gentleman who introduced himself and said he will give us time to select our food & drinks, then ran to the kitchen. By this time we wer
2412;Went there yesterday to watch the Raptors game. The staff was great there. Very attentive and very fast service. The game was on and the bar area was full compared to the dining area. But the manager refused to turn the games sound on. Instead we had to listen to the music they picked. The managers reason for not playing the game is because it's a family restaurant.In short. To all sports fans or people that want to go chill at a bar. AVOID this place. You will be wasting your time and the atmosphere is not there
2413;Party of 10 and service was awful. Waiting over an hour for our cold food and and another twenty for them to warm it up. Overall an awful experience and would not recommend to anyone.
2414;I called this location in the afternoon to pick up some lunch. I ordered the fire grilled salmon salad. I've had it at the restaurant and it was great so I ordered it again. Stupid me, I didn't bother checking the food. Came back to my office and firstly, the portion was TINY for $16.99 plus tax. Secondly, the salmon was tiny AND burnt. It honestly was an $8.99 salad (at the most). If it was actually $8.99 I wouldn't really have cared. I'd have picked off the burnt part and happily gone about my day. But it wasn't. It was a $20 salad. I'm afraid to say that this is how they treat customers who pick up and run without checking their food...but I'm sure that it is (based on other things I've heard about this place...). Needless to say, I'm never ever coming back here, dining in or taking out. I suggest you all do the same. Let's see a respectable restaurant chain take its place!
2415;No, no, no, no.Terrible manager, he is very condescending, cheap and has absolutely NO sense of customer service. Some of the waitresses are terrible as well. Definitely NOT getting my service again and EVERYONE that I know will also be told to steer clear.
2416;For those of you who want an evening that involves paying to eat and be served, don't expect too much from Montana's at Don Mills and Steeles.  This is the third and last time I bring my family to this restaurant.  It begins well, the server impresses you by writing upside down on the brown paper on the table, and drinks are promptly served. On Wednesdays, when it is all you can eat ribs, the server vanishes when you are trying to re-order ribs. When you finally get your second helping of ribs, they are half of what you originally ordered, and over done. Waiting again for another re-order can take up to 15 minutes.  The server is a ghost, and when they materialize, it is with a plastic smile and fake enthusiasm. It is a waiting game, and they are trying to wait you out so you will be full, so pathetic. If you are going to have an all you can eat night, be prompt and attentive to those that have come to eat, and stop playing games.Beyond the aggravating wait to get your food, another aggravation comes wh
2417;Worst Montana ever. Some pointers here:1.  Don't believe in reservations as this place is clueless to what a reservation is. Hostess doesn't know what is going on and disappeared. Left us waiting. 2.  Our server lacked common sense, very forgetful and impatient.  She took down the wrong order and won't admit it.  No apologies.  Other servers had to bring our food.  Other tables around us had the same complaints.  3.  Manager gave us complimentary desert which was a plus but I'd rather her fire her incompetent staff.
2418;That is really bad eating experience. Food is not tasty and just like frozen one. I need wear my winter jacket to eat, no heating inside. It is my first visit, and will be last too.
2419;We decided to go out for dinner last minute. We originally wanted to eat downtown but due to the time (8pm) and it being a Friday we didn't want to wait for a ridiculous amount of time to be seated. After tossing around some ideal places to eat we thought we would give Montana's a try. It wasn't packed upon arrival. We immediately were seated and given drinks. Here is what we ordered: - Calamari, which was terrible. It was fried to the point where it flaked off completely and was beyond the acceptable chewiness that calamari is suppose to have.- Kapow shrimp, a far cry from being popcorn shrimp. It was horribly soggy. I did however enjoy the flavour of it. - Chicken Quesadilla, It's just chicken, canned salsa, and cheese.-  Rib and Shrimp, apparently the ribs were good to the people I were with. The shrimp was made in the same manner as the Calamri. - Veggie and Feta burger, expect greasy sautéed pepers and onions and bland feta cheese. The apple BBQ sauce was strange. The side salad barely had an
2420;Worst Service EVER!!!  Went on a date there and we sat in the Bar section.  Took over 20 minutes for anyone to serve us.  When we found the table had cleaning spray on it and cloth and we asked the waiter if we can sit here.  He said yes walked away. We then asked can you wipe the table down and take the cleaning supplies.  Maybe thats why we got no service.  20 minutes later the bartender came over to take our order.  We both ordered drinks and food. I asked if I can also have a glass of water.  She came and brought only me water.  Why would you only bring one person water?  Later my date asked for water. She came back gave him but never refilled my empty glass. What? Seriously what type of service is this place.  I have been here before the service was just as bad. I was hoping it was a one off. Apparently not.
2421;Definitely one of the "not-so-good" locations I've been to. Not recommending this place, try another Subway.
2422;I used to go there some time ago but the owners are super stingy on toppings. People never smile. Over time I got fed up and went to the Subway at square one, when they were on the 2nd floor. MUCH better. I didn't know they didn't take coupons, well this is what I keep seeing in reviews, how cheap. Why do people continue to support this location? It is close to people who work there and don't mind having sub-par service and a lousy sub.
2423;I cannot believe I am writing a review for a Subway sandwich location. I never have problems until I came to this location. The staff were unwilling to offer me the $5 sub deal, and the sub gave me an upset stomach afterwards.I never plan on returning. I feel sorry for the people who live in the condos nearby and eat here because of convenience.
2424;I went into this place on April 25 and they wouldn't honour a coupon I had.  They claim that they don't accept Subway coupons!I escalated the issue to Subway head office and they had the owner of the location call me.  I have rarely found an alleged business owner to be so unprofessional.  She kept talking over me and saying that it's up to the franchisee whether to accept coupons or not.  What kind of franchise system allows their franchisees to make up their own rules?  The coupon does NOT state anything about being valid at participating locations only.I called back to Subway head office and they told me that their franchisees don't have to accept their coupons, because it would amount to illegal "price fixing".  What nonsense!  I wonder how legal the word "fraud" sounds to them, when they offer a coupon deal and then refuse to honour it.I'm finished with Subway restaurants and informed them of such.My advice is to steer clear of this location, at any rate.  The woman who runs it clearly wants the cust
2425;Being an engineering student, I usually spend my weekends working in labs and the intensive hours of clicking on a computer works up quite an appetite. I suddenly had this urge for Thai food however for some oddly strange reason, it seems every single Thai place within a 2 km radius of UofT was closed on a rainy saturday afternoon!! What the hell! I finally went to College Park to grab some groceries and make my own pad thai when I saw, Thai Bowl... at this point, I didn't care what it was, I just saw thai food and I WANTED ITOh how wrong I was... my mind was telling me to get away but my gut said no, it says Thai food right there, I need it now! But trust me... this place is NOT Thai food. The only Thai thing they have is pad thai noodles and it was absolutely disgusting - soggy, bland. Run by Chinese folk, it was pretty much Man Chu Wok but 10 times worse AND it was also more expensive! $7.50 for a crappy plate of FAKE FOOD? I swear to you I gagged at the first bite I had and threw the rest out... STAY 
2426;Horrible horrible. I am SO angry. I at here yesterday and was throwing up in the middle of the night. I had the chills so bad I couldn't stop shivering to be able to go to sleep (even after wearing 4 layers and under 4 blankets). I have a pretty strong stomach, and never ever throw up (last time was many many years ago).I intend on filing a complaint and asking for my money back as soon as possible.
2427;Every time I come here they mess up the order then they blame me!  The staff hardly speak English here.
2428;HORRENDOUS SERVICE. I always order from this location because it's the closest to my home. Delivery usually takes about 45 minutes, but the last time I ordered, it took OVER AN HOUR. When we called to complain, they said "they were busy." And my house is a 10 minute drive from the Popeyes location. I don't think it takes an hour to drive five minutes. They did not compensate is in any way. So we stopped ordering for a while, and today I called 12-15 times to place an order. Did they answer? No. 12-15 times! No answer! Not from my home phone or my cell phone. Moreover, they always give us bad pieces of chicken, no flavour, no juice. Horrendous location, horrendous staff and service. If you're really craving Popeyes, there's one at Finch. Do yourself a favour and go there instead. That's what we're going to do from now on. Never ordering from this location anymore.
2429;So i walk into mars and ask for a ginger ale abs the waiter says "no problem, whoopdiwoo and all dat" and he proceeds to bring me the Clearest most transparent most light conducted zima light beverage and on top of that as he rests it down he says "your gingerale sir". After much internal debate on what I know a Gingerale should look like, I decide to give my good man the benefit of the doubt and to my surprise,  it wasn't a gingerale after all. In fact, what it was,  bubbly, lime flavoured shit. Do I decided YOLO! Might as well add some sugar. Everything tastes better with sugar right?!...  WRONG! The moral of the story is, judge books by its cover. If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, chances are its not a goat.
2430;Mars Beach Diner seem like a casual place to eat, the place looks tidy and clean, have a front and back patio, and not to mention they have a great location that is right next to the beach.  Unfortunately the food and service here is horrendous, food pretty much taste like it is cooked by a microwave, portions are stingy and the service barley exist with sloppy, disorganize, rude and unprofessional staff on hands.Stay away from this place to save yourself time and money, instead head on over to Sunset Grill for a better service and food, for a little more cash the Green Eggplant is also another great option than Mars, you won't be disappointed.
2431;First time here and it will be the last time. I ask for a glass of water and got a glass  of WARM water. I ask a second time for  a glass of COLD water and still it had no ice cubes in and was still warm.There is only ONE server and he is not  very observing. It is better to go to "Sunset Grill"  and you sure will get  a good breakfast. Or go next door and it is much better there too. Sorry I do not like to be negative but this place certainly does not deserve any more than one star.
2432;I went to the beach with a few people and my boyfriend, we were all hungry so we thought we might just go to a diner. As we enter(due to lack of places besides this one, so it could be a last choice) the place looks inviting. It was basic. Real basic.Anyways the inside was a bit cute but nothing special.As for the food. Not good. My boyfriend's burger was EXTREMELY dry and over-cooked. Alongside that I got the burger with avocado in it (I think the California burger) and it was pathetic. Just imagine this...giant slices of avocados. That's basically the jist of it. They didn't crush it, It was simply four giant slices of avocado that kept falling out of place. It was small portions and dry and bland for the rest of my group.The service sucked more than the food. It was probably the worst i've experienced. We waited maybe over 30 minutes for the food. Also there was only one waitress. And she was rude and disrespectful. She had a sour attitude and didn't apologize for the long wait. She gave us a snarky lo
2433;This location of Mars has been open in the Beach for about a year or so.  The place itself is very nice, clean, and comfortable.  That is where it ends.  The service is horrible.  We were server food and waiting another 10 minutes for cutlery.  We asked for drinks 4 times before being served. On a busy long weekend they were heavily under staffed and highly disorganized.The food itself is cheap, but portions are small and very basic.  If I had  to choose again I would select another option along the strip.  Sunset Grill across the street is very similar but with way better service and better diner fare.
2434;I was looking for a nice meal to brighten up my day.  This place brings nothing but disappointment and bad taste after eating.  On the outside, it seems like a nice and clean place to eat but the food was below average.  The staffs are rude, doesn't look like they want to work there.  The manager is worst, one of the rudest person I've talk to in two years.The cheap price comes with a high cost, a very bad taste after you eat and makes you wanna punch people in the face.
2435;Meat lovers omlette - Really, really unimpressed.Sat on the patio, which was nice. Service was barely decent, but not very attentive or quick.The food is awful. I ordered a Meat Lovers Omelette. When it finally came, it wasn't hot. Quite warm, but not hot. The home fries had onions in them, which I am not a fan of so I asked for fries instead. Instead of just bringing a plate of fries, the waitress took my whole meal away, then brought it back without the home fries at all, and with the promise of fries to come. By this time, the omelette was cold.The omelette itself was pretty sad. Barely any cheese to speak of, and quite overcooked and dried out. The meat inside, while fairly plentiful, was also dry. I got the impression that it was made of stuff that had been cooked but not ordered so it was sitting for a fair while.I got my plate of fries half way through the omelette, and they weren't cooked all the way through. Fries are not difficult. Then again, neither is an Omelette, and they managed to screw th
2436;My partner and I almost barfed after eating there.  Seriously -  we felt queasy and sick. It was after the holiday season...maybe the fridge was turned off or something.   The food was definitely off.  My partner will not eat peamail bacon anymore.  She won't even let me make it.
2437;Extremely workmanlike environment with reasonably good pancakes and well-priced tasty bottomless coffee.Everything extra is extra, and you can quickly out-spend your casual budget. Awkwardly empty the few times I've gone in.Amazed this place still has legs, as it never seems that busy but I'll drop in now and again for a quick bite. It's OK.* Edit * down two stars to one.^Last time (and it really is) I went there the pancakes had little clumps like tiny pieces of cardboard in them and the blueberries in them tasted stale like kind of fermenting or scraped from the bottom of the frozen bag in the fridge. No pride in presentation, gross.^The coffee wasn't so great this trip either. Wait staff never asked how the food was so I simply asked for my bill. Last time I will travel to Mars since the food is apparently so hit-and-miss.^Can not recommend, which is too bad since Mars are local.
2438;Thanks for messing up my order. My friend ordered a "double cheese burger dressed as a mac" and I ordered right after.How does one mess up such an easy order? Not worth it to drive back for this sh---
2439;Went to drive thru at 3:15am. Lady said they are closed from 3am to 4am. To prepare for breakfast. Why lie?? Your not open 24 hours??!? Decided to tell lady. OK I will wait until 4am to get breakfast. Her response was. That's when we start cooking breakfast. You will not good food until 430am. Why false advertise. Your not open 24 hours. Put a sign up that says open 22.5 hours. And I will be happy.
2440;Slowest service I've experienced at a Tim's. Unfortunately it's the closest one to me. There are often long lineups with only one person taking orders.
2441;The donuts are stale here... I realise they don't fry on premises, but how difficult is it to defrost pre-made donuts?
2442;I go in there when I am desperate, and only when I am desperate.This Tim's has gone from bad to worse.Give yourself LOTS of time to order a coffee.  You can get old waiting in the lineup here.
2443;I really have to find another coffee joint in this part of town.The only reason you will find me here is if I am in bad need of a caffeine fix. Not a good place to go if you are a lone female, unless you enjoy being openly checked out by men and hearing cat calls. It's noisy, busy and there's always flies buzzing around in the food case.
2444;The chicken, biscuit and fries was fresh. Even though it is fast food, I wouldn't mind waiting for more than 15 minutes for my dine in order. The problem is that the customer service. They don't seem happy serving the customers, I don't know why. When I asked for ketchup for my 8 big pieces of spicy chicken, she only gave me 2 ketchup packets. I asked the lady if she can give me 6 more ketchup. She said 2 is more. I told her "Okay. Please give me my money back because I don't want my order anymore if you are only going to give me 2 ketchup packets for my 8 big pieces of spicy chicken." She got upset and gave me 5 ketchup packets. Both of us weren't happy because we had a fight over ketchup packets.Will I go back and order there again? Probably not.
2445;I visited this place after a very long time (after this review you will know why). Upon entering, they were surprisingly busy for the time and day I went. The time it took from ordering to actually getting my food was about 20 mins, a little odd for an "express" restaurant. Hoping the time it took for the food to be made meant it would be good was soon realized to be a pipe dream. The chicken was very dry and burnt that didn't bother me. The fact that the food was ABSOLUTELY TASTELESS outraged me. I've had baby food that tasted better. Looking at the potatoes and rice, I hoped for the best as Greek places usually have very tasty potatoes and rice. Once again I was being hopeful and building castles in the sky hoping they would be any good. I really wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you like getting ripped off (I paid $15). If you want Greek food, go somewhere else.
2446;This place is terrible. We are here right now for lunch.  We waited 20 minutes for our basic salads with the pre cooked chicken.  1.  The portions are so small for the price. I ordered a chicken souvlaki- original size with only salad. I got limp brown lettuce and 6 small pieces of chicken that were so small they were bite sized. The size of the salad would be what another restaurant would serve as a side salad. I will need to get more food as it isn't enough. 2. My co worker ordered a Greek salad with a chicken breast. The chicken breast is burnt, and the lettuce is also brown and limp.  The lettuce was swimming in dressing. 3.  The person prepping the food wiped her nose on the top of her hand and continued food prep. She cut up vegetables and meat on the same service which is far from clean. 4. The person cleaning the condiment station also just took dirty napkins from someone's discarded food plate and put them back into the dispenser. All in all we should have gone to another restaurant in the 
2447;the place seems very confused... it has a fish aquarium and partly decorated like its someones house... you pretty much get your typical mall fast food greek food here... but significantly more expensive.my souvalaki was burnt almost black.. parts were inedible. (edible if i wanted cancer from the carcinogens)look at the picture.. then.. while eating the chicken.. i nearly choked when i found out part of the chicken had a skewer which broke off and still in the middle of the piece of chicken.i will say the 100 drink selection coca cola machine might be their only saving grace.  (FUZE green tea is really smooth and delicious)Thats about it..
2448;This place used to be a regular haunt of mine when they first opened in the late 90's. I hadn't been back in years so decided give it a try again and was appalled. The original owners (Greek) have sold up and the current owners obviously have NO experience or knowledge on preparing Greek food. My souvlaki on a pita was totally uninspired as was my boyfriends sandwich. Service was slow and the staff indifferent.
2449;When it first opened several years ago this used to be a good alternative to going to a regular sit-down greek restaurant. Mr. Greek food (and prices unfortunately) with fast food convenience. Over the past couple years however the quality has gone down dramatically, to the point where I won't eat here anymore. On more than one occasion I've ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner and it hasn't tasted like chicken. This is not an exaggeration, it's actually tasted like a cross between lunch meat and a sponge. I am guessing this is caused by the half-cooked skewers sitting in water/brine for extended periods of time prior to being flash-grilled and served. If that isn't bad enough, the owner/manager is an ass and they nickel and dime you for extra tzaziki. If I'm paying 40 bucks for a dinner for 2 at a semi fast-food restaurant, why do you need to charge me $1 for an extra teaspoon of yogurt?Heed my advice and go to Fire Pit down the road instead. You will not be sorry.
2450;Just visited this location after a year with my fiancé. Service was horrible seemed like they didn't even know their own menu. I ordered a greek chicken salad and gyros on a pita with greek fries. Once the chicken salad arrived i could tell the chicken wasn't cooked long enough. The chicken was pink inside, i asked for it to be cooked longer and the person working said she would bring it back to me. She came back with the chicken it was still pink. I brought it to the actual chef/ cook and fully showed her each pink part and she continuously said she didnt see it and that it was white. I asked for my money back which i recieved but the fact a "chef" / cook would say shes unable to see the pink was ridiculous it looked completely uncooked. I wouldnt advise anyone to order chicken from here you might get really sick. Learn how to cook...
2451;This place is filthy!!!, oh and don't ask them to make changes for added cost, they want you to upgrade and pay. Gave it one star because 0 is not an option, please clean up the drips and moldy cheese from the serving counters.
2452;Forgot about my order. When the order finally did come out it was wrong! Waitress never asked if we needed drinks. Terrible, terrible service! Avoid this place at all costs!Update - July 1st, 2017: Someone from this establishment reached out to me stating that they're under new management. Although I cannot personally verify this, I hope things have changed here for the better.
2453;Terrible service. Ok food. The servers have a lot of attitude and the food is mediocre at best. Also the wait times for food are ridiculous. One has to experience too much attitude for food that doesn't warrant a return. I doubt this place will last into next year if their service continues this way. Probably the second time in my life where I didn't leave any tip. Not going back...even if they offer free food.
2454;His name was attracting me to try their fool, but their fool is the worst one I tried in mississauga. I think paramount is better than them.Also, their manakish is nothing make it special than the home made one. I think Adonis manakish is better then theirs.
2455;NEW CHEF!We used to order large meals from this place quite frequently. It was definitely considered the best kosher Chinese food in town, and offered a very wide selection. Recently however, we ordered the same dishes we usually do and something tasted very different. The meat was tougher, the spicy peanut beef wasn't as spicy and the breaded chicken dishes weren't as flavorful. I wasn't enjoying myself. I was later told by my brother in law (who shared the same experience) that the chef was replaced by someone else. Awful. Long story short, I won't go back.
2456;Food has gone downhill. Used to be a 10/10.Wonton soup was off, chicken dish was sour, and vegetables were mushy and tasteless. Used to order many times in the past and loved the food, but after last experience will not go back.
2457;The ONE thing I can write positively about this place is the diversity of food that is offered. There is a lot and for the most part it is generally edible too. I enjoy their spring rolls and General Tao's Chicken and it pretty much ends there.(Don't continue to read if you don't want to read negative comments)Where to begin? Yes, the food is Asian and for the most part there are Asian spices used in their cooking but for anyone who has stepped foot into an authentic Chinese restaurant or has eaten in China would know that Chinese cuisine is more than noodles and breaded chicken in different sauces. I'd give them credit for this move because it allows them to cook multiple dishes at once and interchange with sauces. By the way, having Asian staff in the backroom cook DOES NOT EQUAL authentic Chinese food.That however leads me into my next point. I was at this "restaurant" if you want to call it that over Mother's day. I called at 5PM to place my order and was told it would be a wait of an hour until I c
2458;this place has only been open for a few months and last week they pop machine was broken.i was happy for it to open so i could get there famous root beer float and milk shakes.but they do not have this there and there burgers taste really salty.they r very slow and get over welmed now that the school kids r back.took 20 mins just to get a burger.i wouldnt recommend this place to any one...i will say the girl that took my order was very polite and said sorry for the wait.the manager was so over welmed he no time to say anything to anybody about how slow they r there.A&W not having there shakes or floats is just not right..i no its a fast food outlet but atleast have what ur famous for there other wise its just a burger joint.
2459;Beware this pit , it was the worst food ever! The Mama burger consisted of a slab of onion with flat turd pretending to be a real burger!  Avoid this hole at all cost. What a shameful comment on a once loved company ,that must   have died long ago in my happy past.
2460;This Is the WORST location around ! Don't know why we keep returning (only one in south Whitby) order is ALWAYS WRONG!!! Or somethings missing, Always!! Never drive away with out checking ... We got a burger once with no meat!! NO MEAT!! And on another occasion there was one bite taken out of our mcchicken ... A single bite!!! ... I don't know who runs this place but it needs new management ... We have never got an order correct ... NEVER!!!
2461;Went for lunch here today.   Ordered our food and went to have a seat.  Grabbed a high chair for my daughter and it was completely covered in a thin layer of grease.   I doubt it has ever been wiped down after hundreds of other kids have used it.  Grabbed another high chair which barely less greasy.  Sat at a table and looked down and there was a big piece of hash brown on the ground with no less then 50 ants on it an a trail of them leading back under the bench I was sitting on.   I went and asked one of the girls at the front if she could clean it up for me (she was very nice and was a little disgusted when she saw it)  She cleaned it up and we continued eating.   Within a couple of minutes, another 30-50 ants were back in the same spot.The play area is coated with the same layer of grease.  One of the "pods"for the kids to play in at the top of the play ground has a big window in it.  the inside of the window is covered in either barf or an old milk shake.   Dont let your kids play here unless they have 
2462;I don't know why I return here but unfortunately it's the only one near in whitby south.  This place has terrible service and get away with it because it's one of the highway stops.  AVOID!!!! Or just go to the ti Hortons or the Wendy's nearby.Food/ambience/price: whateverService: just terrible. They are famous for not filling up cups for smoothies, frappes etc where you get like 75% of it. And when you ask, they say "oh we have to make another to do that" if that was the case, why didn't you fill it up right at the beginning.  They need better trained people or management is messed up.
2463;Can't understand the Pizza Hut hype. Placed an order for myself and my toddler. Order was confirmed at 6:40pm...... Pizza showed up at 8:10, lukewarm at best, greasy hand prints on the box, tasted disgusting, and after 3 phonecalls, I got my partial credit. Lesson learned....  Instead of crediting people, work on your pizza making, possibly staff training.  And for the excuse from your staff that the "app and pc don't really communicate" so times can greatly vary from what your confirmation states..... Get your IT staff looking into this promptly! Poor excuse.Once bitten, twice shy.
2464;I got coupons in the mail for Pizza Hut and thought ok let's try it... We never eat Pizza Hut pizza so it would be a nice change..I called and spoke with a young girl she was friendly enough but when I ordered the deal with the coupon it was supposed to be 36.99 by the time I got the total it was over 50.00.... I asked for a break down of the bill and it was ridiculous I cancelled the order. I will not be ordering Pizza Hut anytime soon. 2 medium pizzas a bottle of pop and 10 chicken bites should never be 50.00$
2465;Decided to try something new and placed my order online and it arrived luke warm which was surprising because it was burnt and the pepperoni was overcooked. To make it worse there was no sauce! We had ordered stuffed crust and the cheese was the consistency of an old cheese stick - not melted at all. The wings were also horrible and room temperature. The sauce was the consistency of soup and really salty. The chipits cookie was stale.Don't waste your money.
2466;made a mistake of coming here for lunch!! service was not so bad....but the food? it should be served in the fast food area of the mall.
2467;After informing the waitress of my time restriction it took her 15 minutes to even come to the table and take our order. The ramen I had was beyond gross. The noodles were extremely overcooked, the meat had no taste and the broth was disgustingly bland and flavorless. I've had the sushi here before and it was ok, but this experience has given me reason to never go back.I eat a lot of ramen and this was by far the worst I've ever had. I left 95% of the bowl untouched and still paid for it. Never again...
2468;The restaurant was almost empty yet the servers were rude and inattentive - they obviously don't care about tips. I will definitely not be returning. Save your money and eat elsewhere.
2469;To-go sushi was at average price, however rice was hardened and you can tell it was old. After eating all 7 pieces, I discovered a hair on the last piece... YUCK! ALL EMPLOYEES HANDLING FOOD SHOULD WEAR A HAIR NET!
2470;Went to this place today with my wife around 6.20 pm and ordered our food in 5 mins.... After 30 minutes of waiting, I asked one of the waitresses how our order was and she said she saw that coming. Another 5 mins later, another waitress come and asked if we have ordered our food and we finally realized our order never go to their system. During the period, I've seen 3 or 4 couples left without anything on their table. This is absolutely the worst restaurant and service I've seen
2471;Non-existent service. It took forever to order and that wasn't even the worst part. Our food came out separately... why even have a dine-in portion if you are incapable of timing our food to come out at the same time? The worst part is we were never ever served water until we asked for it. You would think they'd noticed that we were eating our food but still had no water...Sushi also was not served with soy dipping dishes.Food was nothing spectacular. Definitely not going back.
2472;Service was bad. Took them 20 minutes to take my order. Food was mediocre at best.
2473;Party of two ordered the salmon lovers and veggie rolls with two miso soup bowls.The restaurant was empty during the busy lunch hours at the food court but we still wanted to go for sushi and that was the only choice we had. We got our miso soup and it had an irregular smell. Then the main order comes in and the salmon lovers was full of skin and felt old and chewy to the point that I couldn't eat half the plate. We called the waitress and complained that we have been to many Japanese restaurants but none offered salmon as such for sushi . The reason obviously could be to the fact the fish turnover at that place is extremely low. At the end nothing was done from the restaurant side for the food or the bill. We left and wanted to make sure no one has such an experience. Avoid at all costs unless you want to pay for bad food.
2474;Food takes forever to come! The table next to me came 15 minutes after I ordered and still they got the food first.  This will be the fiirst and last time I'll come to this POS wannabe Jap restaurant.
2475;I wish I could give 0 stars, because this place doesn't even deserve 1 star.I came here for dinner with my parents before a show at Massey Hall. The people I was with ordered some appetizers and a few sushi rolls, and I ordered the chef's menu. We told our waitress we had to be at a show in an hour and and a quarter, and she said no problem, she'd make sure the food was out quick. Our drinks came quick, then, after 15 mins, our miso soup came. It was way too salty. Then we sat and waited for the rest of our food. By the time any food came out (yakitori appetizer that my dad had ordered and a salad that my mom had ordered), it had been 35 minutes since we'd ordered. Then a couple single sushi orders my dad ordered came out. That was the last food we saw. I called the waitress over and told her that I'd ordered the chef's menu, and 45 minutes later I'd only gotten miso soup (plus the rest of the food my parents ordered hadn't come out). She looked surprised (wasn't she our waitress? and there were only a 
2476;One star for the ok food. The plating was nice but be prepared to wait a long time before somebody attends to you even if the restaurant does not appear to be busy. I saw some people leave only because nobody went to take their orders. I rarely give one star reviews but unfortunately it was the service that really got to my group. Took a while for somebody to come to take our order. Asked for three glasses of water and we only got two and had to ask again for the last one. Of course it never came. Food took a while to come and of course when it came, we didn't have any soy sauce, so trying to get the servers attention was exhausting. Eventually when we got their attention, they started rolling their eyes or sighing. Overall, the service can use some significant improvement. I feel they just have to come up with a way to be more efficient because what happens is that everybody is trying to get their attention and then with so many requests at once they tend to forget about the other ones. Did I mention
2477;Absolutely terribleDon't waste your time or money hereEspecially when there are so many other places in the Eaton Center food area and around downtownFirst, service was AWFULThe waitress was slow, never checked on us, didn't bring us our bill (I had to go look for someone to bring us a bill)She also didn't know what was on the menu and was confused by what we ordered (even though it was pictured on the menu)They are overpriced and the sushi is very meh My friend ordered sushi that was supposed to have fresh salmon wrapped around it. Instead they brought something with milled salmon and when we asked about it, we were told a few things - 1. the milled salmon is quicker, 2. there's a new sushi chef who can't wrap the salmon around and 3. they never had it with the fresh salmon (even though it's pictured on their menu)The waitress was not pleasant or happy and ignored us most of the time (we were there for lunch during the week - it was NOT busy so there's really no excuse)It cost over $20 for 2 ro
2478;Oh boy. Why do they even bother with the yuppie atmosphere? This place sucks. I ordered bibimbap, which is stupid easy to make. It cost 6 dollars more than good bibimbap I've had at little holes in the wall in Chinatown. I got a bowl of rice with a bunch of lettuce and an egg on top. Hot sauce wasn't hot, lettuce wasn't even crisp and was unpleasantly hot on the edges. I am waiting for the bill as we speak and am probably going to cry as I shell out 15 dollars for this wad of misery.
2479;Friday afternoon. I went there for lunch. Was seated down in a minute or two. Looked like a full house, but there were still a few tables available amd plenty of wait-staff. After waiting ten minites, which I let go because they were busy, someone took my order. I ordered a coke with lemon, miso soup, and two spicy salmon rolls. Twenty-five minutes go by and everyone who came after me is getting their food. Meanwhile I didnt even get my beverage. Finally the girl who took my order comes over and says "sorry what was your order again?" I was shocked. I said "you took my order, how can you ask this?". She told me they had some problems and she kept looking over my shoulder as if she's getting instructions from the kitchen. I said "you're telling me you never had my order for almost half an hour?" Then she started pretending that she doesn't understand me well even though upon my arrival she  had been conversing very fluently and telling me about the dishes. I directly asked her if they've started my food or not
2480;No washroom inside ?!?! - how they pass the inspection?Horrible customer service. Food was fine.Do not say "Thank you", because they will not reply "You are welcome". Customers are ignored for long time.Too dark atmosphere...save your money.
2481;This restaurant at the Eaton Center is pure garbage. First, they are highly understaff. One waiter that hardly speaks English is in charge of more than 10 tables and another girl, who's only function from what I can see is to hand out the food and to sit new customers down. We ordered our food...30 minutes in, nothing. Not even our tea was given to us. We ordered a bottle of beer too, nothing. We asked the girl waiter, TWICE, kindly for the food, and she is clueless. We also asked you should at least give us tea and our beer, it never came. Then finally, after 45 minutes, the boy waiter comes and say "sorry your order sheet that I wrote down what you have order for wet...so what did you order?" Okay so you tell me, that it took you 45 minutes to realize that our paper was WET? And you didn't bother telling us? And hello, we only ordered 4 dishes, really it's that hard for you to remember that? Then you really don't know how to be a waiter. Then I ask to speak to the manager, there is NO manager!! Hahaha
2482;Unfortunately this restaurant has secluded itself to a very, very dark corner of the food court.  The outside is not appealing and the placement of the sushi bar and door are awkward.The food is also deplorable.  Curry chicken udon noodles tasted like a watery version of cheap instant noodles with lumps of boiled chicken.  The tempura batter was overly floury and undercooked.The decor is excellent and the service is commendable.  Unfortunately, they need to rework the flow of traffic in their restaurant and upgrade the standards of their menu.
2483;I've visited the place a couple years ago, service was fine. I came back early November and I will seriously never return. I am not one to go above and beyond to a review a place I had a terrible experience at. Actually, I've never had a terrible experience at a restaurant. Sure, there were times when I would have small complaints, but who doesn't? Whenever I read people who review places and claim that the service was absolutely atrocious, I usually think to myself, "Come on.. It can't be that bad." Well, my experience at this place WAS that bad. We were greeted by a young male (early twenties perhaps), didn't say hello or anything. He stood there until we said "for three please". He grabbed menus and proceeded to walk to the front area of the restaurant. (Didn't even say "right this way" or anything similar, LITERALLY JUST WALKED) but whatever, we followed him. He stood and looked around and realized the entire room was full. So he turned around (again, NOT A SINGLE WORD!) and took us around to the back
2484;Haven't been back to Toronto for a while and dropped by this place for late lunch. The service was extremely terrible, the male server seemed encountering his 'menstruation' and was unhappy and uninterested in serving you. Even if you waved to get his attention, he just completely ignored you and walked by pretending not seeing it.When you ordered your food, he gave this long face that it seemed that he really, really reluctant to give you service. Then, not sure his pretending or really not understand my order in English.I ordered a noodle combo mix and a Diet Coke but the latter never arrived on my table. Luckily, the food arrived quickly and one did not have to put up with the obnoxious attitude. The sashimi was ok but the yellowtail was not fresh and stale.The Cali roll was plain and ok.Most horrible was the ramen, it was tasteless, no flavor at all and it felt like the chef forgotten to put in the seasoning - worst noodle I have ever eaten in N America so far.Overall, a very unpleasant expe
2485;Was something going wrong today? It was our first time trying Swiss chalet. Cold gravy soaked sandwiches... Gross.  Bland chicken soup requires much hot sauce to enjoy. Slimy tortilla in my wrap... What!, why?  The topper is their "famous" chalet sauce?  All 4 of us tried it, and it was a no, no, no, no. It tastes of fermented applesauce, corn starch, watery dirt. The sauce is down right disgusting. Did someone mess up the recipe?  Lacks any good flavor.  We left very disappointed.
2486;I love Swiss Chalet, but THIS particular location bites the big one. I'll never go there again! We went there for dinner and my husband ordered the wings. I have no earthly idea why they ran out of the proper sauce that would normally go over Chicken Wings. For whatever reason, they smothered his wings with the sauce you would put on the ribs! Gross beyond gross!
2487;The restaurant was legit empty when we got there at 5:45 for our 6:00 reservation. As in we were the only ones there. Yet we were told by the hostess AND our waitress that we HAD to be done with dinner by 9pm because our table was booked. Very odd, and by the time we were done with dinner at 7:15, there were only 4 other tables seated. However we realized why they were so worried about kicking us out. We walked by again at around 11 after the show at Second City, and there was a line out the door. This place turns into a Techno Nightclub. That's why they want you out, so they can move the tables and set up their dance floors. It made sense after, and also as to why the waitresses were wearing skimpy cocktail dresses.Food was not good. However, if we knew beforehand that this place was more interested in being a night club than a restaurant, we never would have gone!
2488;Food is mostly terrible. I disliked it the first time I went and also the second time. Its a great place for a partying but I would suggest having dinner elsewhere
2489;Literally the WORST experience ever. We organized a party of 18 for a bachelorette party and could not believe how awful the staff and ambiance were. A downtown restaurant that can't adequately accommodate a gluten intolerance?!Manager was rude and condescending. Do not waste your time or money on this hole. Surprised they managed to stay in business treating people this way. Avoid at all costs.
2490;Really bad bad service across the board.1. We made reservations for 10 people. When the first 4 people got there they made them wait for 20 minutes in the front, until the "majority arrives". At this point I already wanted to go some place else. I stayed because it was my friend's birthday.2. So when the majority arrived we got our table. The waitress took so long to even get our drinks it was painful. We waited there for like 20 minutes until she finally came back.3. Finally we start placing our order for drinks and food. I was told I could not add absolutely anything to my pizza because the cook didnt like that...I could only remove items just not add any, I wasnt even offered the option to pay for it, it was all "SORRY YOU CANT ADD NOTHING". All i really wanted was some prosciutto, well ya, not allowed. 4. So with my food I ordered a beer, I got the beer bottle fairly quickly then the waitress disappeared for like 40 minutes. So we are still waiting for our food with empty beer bottles and with no 
2491;So mad right now!  They spilled drinks and broken glass all over me.  Accidents happen so no big deal, but they offered to bring me a drink to compensate me and it never materialized.  What pisses me off is that I bought 2 drinks and had only 2 sips before their staff cleared it!  WTF!!  Horrible customer service!!
2492;Um... Hate leaving nasty reviews... If you know me, I'm the kind of person who finds positives in anything and everything. But this place... Haha just can't help but laugh at how beyond horrible the service was. I've been to the Montreal location and thought it would be same light happy atmosphere with awesome service to match the delicious food... But no. We called in advance to make dinner reservations for 8 people for 9.30pm on a Friday to start off my best friends bachelorette night. When we all ordered drinks and food (two pizzas, two appetizers and a main to share) we were told by the waitress that we need to each order a main in order to "keep your table" which somehow wasn't mentioned on the phone when we were making reservations. When I said that not everyone of us was that hungry she called the manager. I told the manager that we will compensate with drinks but he said that in that case we need to get two bottles of liquor minimum. Basically we all ended up ordering food that noone ate just to ke
2493;Bad food, bad service!! Would never go back.  They should take a lesson from neighbouring clubs on how to run bottle service and treat your guests.  The owners need better management running this place.
2494;The meatballs were excellent, but the service and overall experience were so far below-par that I can't bring myself to give this establishment more than one star.After enjoying their experience at the sister Buonanotte in Montreal, my friends had booked a large party of 12 to come by a few weeks after the restaurant's grand opening.We know that things can be cumbersome when a new business is settling so we tried our best to make it easy for them, booking two months in advance and calling a few days prior to remind them we were coming.Unfortunately, it seemed that they forgot about us and all the large tables were already taken. Management did not attempt to make the situation right, they did not apologize, they actually found a way to make matters worse: after making us wait for "just a few" (aka 45) minutes, they sat us at three separate tables.Although the tables were not heavy and could easily be moved, they told us it was against their policy to displace the tables at that time in the evening.W
2495;This place literally fucking  sucks, they advertise it turning into a club at 11 on weekends, but run out of beer at 10:30. It's way over priced for the crappy food you get, and the music and service are shitty. Would never go again.
2496;I went here on a Saturday night for a birthday. The party I was with (the people) were great and I had a good time with them but the place itself was sort of a disaster. First, they can't decide what they are - restaurant, lounge or club and it's weirdDuring dinner, the music was blasting - making it almost impossible to talk to people at the table (not sure why the music is so loud since noone is dancing during dinner - there isn't any space) then around 11:30, it turns into a club - you know this because the music becomes much louder and they start getting rid of chairs, but not tables, so you get to dance around the tables, which they keep for bottle service (this is very weird to me) and they just start letting in tons of people... All to dance around tables... They also don't do a great job with the bottle service - there were no lemon or line wedges, after the place turned into a "club", our waitress/ shot girl was nowhere to be found and we ran out of glasses. Also, she would take away half finished d
2497;I was here with my boyfriend for a bite to eat and some drinks, upon the recommendation of an owner following an interview for a position. I can see why they were interested in new management options, coming from an industry veteran and reading past Yelp reviews. Our meal at this establishment left a lot to be desired, and my partner and I agreed that had I not been interested at the time, we would have said something to management and left earlier in the evening. The hostess was lovely and kind, but we were sat at a large table for 4 right by the front door and it was a breezy, cold night to be by a door. Our server was polite enough table side, but it was not the level of service I would expect and we did not see her consistently throughout the evening, often sitting without drinks and with dirty items in front of us. We ordered a pizza and a bottle of red wine to share. The pizza came out within minutes of ordering because the place wasn't overly busy on a Thursday night. However the bottle of wine did
2498;very disappointed with not only the service but the food as well. we had the last dinner seating for a group and were told we need to preorder the apps and dessert so that we weren't holding the table for too long... we sat down and the server told us there were no apps ready for us. so we had to order our own - this worked out well for some of us as we all didn't want apps. the server came around and said we HAD to order apps because everyone else was- that really upset me and a few other people as we're now wasting food. the birthday individual was happy for the free champagne she was given but the person pouring the glasses spilt it on me and the person sitting beside me. I felt that since it was the last dinner seating everything was rushed and cold. the pasta I got was tasteless I feel I get better tasting food at a chain like scaddabush. on top of that my pasta was colder than room temp. the dessert we got wasn't good either and we felt like they just wanted us out so they can get ready to switch ov
2499;Bland food, disorganized staff, cluttered and ineffective layout, long wait at the bar, oh and see-thru doors in the washroom - what!!! All this goodness for exaggerated price tag. At least save yourself the frustration and go somewhere where they'll will provide you quality service, if you decide to spent some money.PS had my full new drink taken away from the table while I was in the restroom.
2500;Overpriced douchefest. Avoid at all costs. This place is taking up space on precious Toronto real estate. I had the gnocchi, it was wet potato balls in watery tomato gravy. Our particular server acted as if she was doing us a favour so if you like that please book your table today. Your group will also enjoy the privilege of paying a mandatory 18% tip to be ignored. It's next to Second City... Maybe it's performance art that hasn't ended yet? Please close down.
2501;To start off with, I've worked in the service industry for 4 years, so not only am I more lenient than most, but I know what they're going through. This place was the worst. We had a group of people there (maybe 20 or so). They would a) NOT split the bills and b) only allowed us to pick from a fixed menus. Firstly, not splitting bills is amateur - almost every restaurant worth anything nowadays has a system that makes this incredibly easy. And I mean regular, run of the mill restaurants would have this. Secondly, I understand the fixed menu thing - it creates for less confusion and people getting their food at the same time. However, charging $45/ person and only giving you TWO options (pasta and pizza) is awful. Not to mention, the two options that probably have the highest markup. The pizza was alright, the pasta (my wife's) was awful. Their only - and I mean ONLY - thing that was good was their shrimp in their calamari, that earned them the one star. My wife's $16 house wine glass took about 30 min
2502;If I could give it less stars I would. Brunch on a Sunday is a set menu of literally five options, a starter, main and "dessert". Smoked salmon is three burnt crackers, minuscule pieces of salmon and micro greens. Caprese salad for main is horrible, full of oil and again greens instead of other ingredients. Burger for main had no taste, we asked for hot sauce. Service is extremely slow and one person didn't even get one of her courses. Brunch took about two hours and we didn't even get dessert because we had evening plans and had to leave.  I called it a diet brunch. I have had better meals at ikea. People dress very nicely for brunch here, high heels, clubbing dresses etc. Music was so loud we were yelling across the table to have a conversation. Go to Copacabana which is very close instead!!! Amazing brunch there, this place is horrible.
2503;I am writting a review to warn people interested in going to this restaurant. There is a 35 dollar food purchase minimum required per person. And all the while it isn't very difficult to spend that as their food items are way over priced for the value that, it still forced upon you to overspend even if all you want is one food item. The food had small portions unless you were ordering the pizza, but the pizza was ultra thin and mediocre tasting.My father's small pasta came out cold and by the time they remade it, the rest of the table had nearly finished eating, in addition they totally forgot or couldn't be bothered to offer cheese. The ambiance was very modern and hip but the music was so loud I could not speak or hear anyone besides those directly besides me. This wouldn't be such an issue if your only a party of 2 but anymore than that then expect to no converse or hear each other.
2504;Very confusing setup last Friday evening. We had been invited by a jeans brand after Toronto Fashion Week and were looking forward to their party at Buonanotte.It was a very weird mix of people sitting at tables, eating dinner and various other very drunk people mashing into you to get to the one bar on the other side of the venue. Nearly impossible to order a drink in that manner so we decided to try to get a table to enjoy ourselves.We asked the waiter to get us a table if possible as we wanted to order some food however he said at that point we would have to buy a bottle (!) to have a seat. We did ask if we could order wine, which was going to be ok with us, he said yes but returned with just a food menu, not a wine list. My boyfriend asked him again if we would be getting a table but he seemed to busy to have a time estimate.After ten awkward minutes of standing in the middle of the restaurant/dance floor in front of the DJ we left, went elsewhere and had a much better time. Its too bad too as the
2505;Believe the reviews, this place is horrible. I came for a bachelorette party and we had a set menu with some vegetarian modifications. Pasta was not fresh and bland. Calamari over cooked, served cold and way too salty. For a place with a pizza oven, all the bread/pizza was served cold. Food was either not seasoned at all or incredibly salty. The mark up on wine is ridiculous and $40 for corkage if you bring your own is laughable. Considering it was a bachelorette, I was shocked how slow the servers were about replenishing drinks. The server tried to take a bottle of wine that wasn't finished. Settling up was a nightmare and she actually just laid all of her receipts down and walked away. The manager did give us a bottle of $12 Prosecco on the house and offered us better wine for no charge when they ran out of what we were drinking but the general quality of service and food can't be made up for. The washrooms were filthy and I was shocked to see that someone brought a child with them to a place that turns int
2506;Terrible. That's all I got. I'm here right now, and instead of enjoying myself, I feel compelled to point out that this is the worst DJ in THE WORLD
2507;I was at this place for my birthday celebration on Saturday night. The night had both some highs but sadly many lows. The pros of this place: atmosphere and menu were pretty good. The cons: First of all, they would NOT do a separate bills. What this does at the end of the night is confusion and frustration. They also sneak in the 18% gratuity, which I think is tacky considering service is something that a consumer should choose and not have imposed. There was one member in our party who came to dinner in shorts which he was served, fed, and then asked to leave because he wasn't following dress code. Forget that it was over 35 degrees and he's a professional wearing a nice polo, but to take your money and then asked to leave- not cool. Neither is a rude staff member calling him white trash.I will NOT be going back to this establishment as long as this is the service that is offered. For 1000$ bill, I expect way more.
2508;Honestly, the staff is unbelievably rude and will not go here again. After buying 5 rounds of six drinks, spending over $300 and tipping 10% each time, when I went to pay for the last round one of the drinks spilled. I finished paying and told the bartender and she said "there's nothing I can do"..Everyone was waiting for me to get my drink and were all wondering why the lady was being so rude after we just spent so much money. I explained the the lady I just bought 5 rounds and was asking just to top off one of them. The bartender said "listen lady, you tipped me 10% each time I have to tip out 7% to the club, if you want the drink you have to buy another one". I left and went somewhere else and will not be returning.
2509;Not going to regurgitate what others have already mentioned about the service and food.  Would not recommend this restaurant.  Only saving grace is the attentive waitress.
2510;The most pretentious establishment I have ever been to. 10 of us there for a birthday ending with the birthday girl cussing out the staff.  Forcing us to order appz and mains because apparently it's a privilege to be there and we need to be forced to pay your bills. THEN taking over 2 hours to serve our mains....with a giggle and a surprised look on their face when we looked annoyed. Serving people around us who had arrived over an hour later. I only wish our whole party had walked out before we ate so we could stick you with the bill, and waste your table for over 2 hours. I will never ever EVER return here and I will tell everyone I know how horrible this experience was. It's one thing to be slow and off your game one night and it's another to be an a$$hole about it. Nothing comp'd...no sorry....nothing....just a snobby and I don't give a f*ck attitude throughout. Dude, there are plenty of places to eat and dance in this city....with a way better atmosphere and staff. Get ur sh*t together.
2511;We ordered the 38 ounce steak... It was not even warm... Same with the mashed potatoes. The seafood pasta and scallops were overly salty. I would not return here for meals. Combine that and they forgot an order.
2512;Rarely do I try a new place without checking Yelp, but I didn't in this case ~ and well....The food is mediocre and the service slow ...just as the others described.I had the tomato mozzarella salad.  Over ripe tomatoes, bland cheese, tiny portions.  Over priced. Not to mention, they had double booked our table and although the service was painfully slow, the hostess told us to essential eat quickly as the second group had arrived for their seating?!
2513;I came here with a group of friends for a birthday dinner. I did not enjoy it, which was disappointing because I really wanted to! I had the steak tartar as an app, which was fine. But the gnocchi was awful! It was so mushy and bland. It tasted overcooked. My boyfriend had a steak, which I tried. It was tough and dry. The birthday girl had the rabbit stuffed pasta. I tried that as well and found the stuffing to be super dry and flavourless! I went back on another occasion (because it is very conveniently located) and had a white sauce pizza with mushrooms. I actually enjoyed that, although it was served a bit cold. I also had a bottle of wine with the pizza, which might be why I thought the pizza was so good.I'd say get a pizza because those are ok. But overall the quality is too poor to justify the prices, which are fairly high. I'm totally willing to pay for a great meal, Buonanotte just doesn't serve one. The waitresses look good though.
2514;Crap...poor service, the waitresses seemed very confused, the food was mediocre and I didn't enjoy my soggy pizza. This place is trendy's awkward cousin.
2515;This place looks good and the vibe there was good. The issue we had yesterday (Friday night) was with the waitress and the food.., the waitress had no clue on the menu!, she said she is new and that she can't even pronounce the dishes.., she also admitted that screwed up our order and didn't know how to do it with the kitchen, so we got the pizza first, after 15 minutes the salad showed up, and 15 minutes later the appetizer came (and in not exaggerating with the times). The pizza was ok but had a bit of an off taste, the salad was soaking in vinegar and was almost not edible, and the bruschetta was the only thing I can rank as good.
2516;Sometimes you just want to listen to Jared and get sometimes cheap, healthy, and kind of delicious. And for me when these times come a calling subway is a good option. But I have to say this is by far the worst subway I have ever been to.One, they don't participate in ANY of the subway promotions. There are no subs of the day. And there are no five dollar subs either. Don't even bother asking if they have ANY deals. Two, the subs that they do make are haphazardly put together... like most subways, but I think this place takes the cake. When it comes down to it, it's still a cheap meal. But there are a lot of other subways out there. I go to the one down at Queens Quay and York instead of this one even though it's a little farther for me, but it's well worth it!
2517;A server named Heer was immensely rude and degrading towards customers. We had friends in the line that weren't ordering and she asked them to leave because they were apparently distracting her. She later brightened up and tried to seem nicer as she realized we were writing a review. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!
2518;Ordered a "fiery hot" chicken pizza, expecting decent spice. I eat spicy Chinese soups, dishes, and all kinds of hot Indian foods. This pizza, however, was beyond hot. All that I could taste was heat borderline painful, with zero flavour. flavour. There wasn't even any tomato sauce. Two of my friends who also enjoy hot foods couldn't handle this either. If they were tasting what they were making, this pizza would have never been made like this. It felt like we were the butt of a practical joke, will not be ordering from here again.
2519;I ordered delivery from them today, and I had a bad experience. Not only was part of my order ignored, and therefore I didn't get it (but thankfully not billed), but the driver was pretty rude and acted inappropriately.The driver took my credit card from me and cut me out of the payment process (he scanned the NFC chip when I explicitly told him I didn't want that). When I vocalized his error he said I should call head office. Okay fine.I called Pizza Pizza and told them what happened, and they agreed that the driver shouldn't have done what he did.I did order a pizza and I did recieve my order but the driver should not have taken his own liberties with my payment processing after I articulated what I didn't want done. I won't be ordering from here anymore.
2520;I ordered a large pizza. The pizza itself was inedible due to the spice. I am no stranger to spice as I indulge in various culture's cuisine (i.e Indian, Mexican). The spice on the pizza was overwhelming that I honestly thought the employees made a mistake on order. Does Pizza Pizza taste their products because this was honestly a joke. I am an avid pizza eater and gave Pizza Pizza a chance. This franchise is an insult to not only pizza but also costumer service. A complete disappointment. I will not be ordering from this franchise again.
2521;Just read about Kody's departure from Mattino.   What are the people at this restaurant thinking?   Kody made this spot into the best environment on College street.  Now that he's apparently gone, I suspect that it will go the route of every other junky resto-bar that's been on this corner.It's ironic, because I was just about to go onto Yelp and write a shining review about this spot... to inform the community about how spectacular the attention to detail and personal service was.    And I, like others before me, was looking forward to letting everyone know about Kody and his wonderful rapport with the customers and staff.   We started hanging out here pretty heavily, almost entirely because of him and his mastery of the hospitality business.  Oh, it's probably worth letting you know that I have no prior connection to the guy whatsoever.I'm beginning to think that the only reason that this bar exists is to schlock this horrid herbal supplement that the owner's inexplicably been trying to place on e
2522;I was heartbroken to hear about Kody's departure from Mattino.  Like Daniel B., I'd had no prior contact with him, but he was close to 80% of the reason I had become a regular at Mattino and had recommended it to so many friends and colleagues.   Granted, some strange things had begun to happen there.  We had gone for dinner during the Taste of Little Italy, and while we were eating, a young girl came around and delivered pamphlets to our otherwise romantic table about this strange fruit based energy drink.  I agree with Daniel that it seems they're confusing owning a restaurant with a test market for snake oil.  You can't expect to be an overwhelming success in only a few weeks of being open for business.  I know it's hard for first time restaurateurs, but if you want to survive in Little Italy, every decision counts, and people notice the bad ones more.*Quick update:  July 1stI threw a party at Mattino for 30 or so people, against my better judgment.   One of our guests was sitting by me on the patio
2523;Of the numerous Subways around U of T campus, this is by far the worst. Every single time I have ever went there, I have been dissatisfied. Either the employees were rude, the dining area was disgusting, or, worst of all, the staff couldn't make my order right. Before going to this specific subway, I didn't know it was possible to mess up a simple turkey sub, but thanks to the staff there (or one specific lady who always seems to be working), I now realize it requires some level of skill. Here's a specific little story: I ordered my usual 6-inch turkey breast on italian bread. Toasted of course. I wasn't paying attention as the lady put ham on my sandwich and preceded to toast it. After it came out of the oven, I realized it was ham and pointed this out, since I cannot eat ham. She told me I had ordered this (really? I don't think I would make that mistake, since I ALWAYS order the same thing and cannot eat ham...), and asked if I was SURE I didn't want it. I said no, and so she preceded to throw away the ha
2524;Starting the the assumption that Subway is a healthy-ish fast food option and nothing more, I wanted to review this location, in particular. My Subway of choice is the location in Robarts Library on the University of Toronto campus. The staff there are nice, the bread is fresh, and the cheese is relatively plentiful. None of those are true of this location. The amount of grated cheddar they give you here is maybe 1/3 of what you'd get at Robarts Subway. Also, I saw the guy at the till, presumably the owner, not ring in purchases. People aware of how things work with some small businesses will understand that this means he is not paying all the taxes he should. The upstairs area is too hot. You'd think that the windows would ameliorate the situation. They do not because they are screwed shut. Never coming back to this location if I can help it. If you don't mind the students (and Aramark, I'm presuming), go to the Robarts location. Folks there are very friendly and would be happy to take your order.
2525;Brought my kids here and they split a meal.  Asked for one package but two paper plates and she told me she would have to charge me extra. Wow, no kids combo can order from and they want to charge me extra for a paper plate. Never coming back here. Food was ok according to my kids. Thank you Xia for not charging me for the extra fork.
2526;I think by far this is the worst customer service I've had in a long time. First of all, they were rude. They don't speak English very well and did not explain how everything works. My best friend wanted a three combo (one meat, two sides, and rice or noodles) but instead got only one side and they freaked out on her as if it was her fault. Second of all, the food was disgusting. In Winnipeg, the broccoli have a great sauce, the rice is amazing - you can't stop eating, and the meat is more meat than flour. Here, the broccoli were dry, the rice was tasting like old, burned oil, like they didn't wash their dishes after using it to cook and all the burned made the rice taste like burned, and the meat was only fat covered in 10 layers of flour and tons of sauce. I couldn't get more than four-five bites. I went to them again because I wanted my money back, my friend accompanied me and I was asking nicely if I can get the money back, then she started explaining we need a receipt because otherwise she cannot refund 
2527;Would give zero stars if I could. Was looking forward to getting Chinese but I wanted to try an item to make sure something wasn't too spicy for me and was rudely told by an employee"NO SAMPLES!"  Their less than a penny sample cost them a customer!
2528;Tried the sesame chicken and got food poisoning within 30 minutes. My friend warned me that this place gave him food poisoning but i wanted to give it a shot... Never again
2529;I came to this aroma and it's much smaller than the ones I'm used to. I found it quite dirty. The floor had food and wrappers on the ground. I think they really need to sweep the floor at least once in the middle of the day. The service was good. The lady working was very friendly and our drinks arrived in a timely manner. It was nice that this location is kosher. It really attracts the right demographic but compared to the other Aromas, I could not get over the dirty floor was. Would I go back to this location? No, I would not. I would rather go to the other locations that are much more clea
2530;Went to this location early Feb./16. Definitely not up to a proper Aroma Espresso location standard. The decor is cold and flimsy and the one booth had a Reserved sign on it while it was empty the whole time I was there. You pay half a dollar extra for your flavour shot, which is standard, but not the part where you ask for the cream and they tell you, "We don't have cream at this location." Paying $3.10 for a regular brew coffee at a cafe where every other location offers everything from skim to 18% is just wrong. Don't come here if you're looking for another Aroma like the one at Yonge and Eg.
2531;So excited when this location opened near my work. Just got a salad. Paid with a 10 dollar bill, got a few small coins back for change. The whole cold mess went in the garbage. Waste. Tasted funny and at its essence just a whole bunch of cucumber and tomato. Not a threat to the other less than fresh joints around.  Blah, WHY?
2532;They closed the kitchen at 930pm For you're scheduled to be closed at 10pm, it means that is when you clean up. It doesn't mean you leave at 10pm at the expense of denying your customers half your menu. Then why are you still open. Rude staff as we.
2533;Horrible customer service. Inexperienced workers. Every time I order something, it never comes to me. They lie all the time. I ordered a latte and it didn't come to me. I ordered a portobello sandwich, and they were also treating me like dirt. I wish they had more experience. This is why I don't like to come here.
2534;Really slow service every time we come. It's too bad we have to wait 15-30mins for an ice aroma.
2535;Ordered wings and pizza. Delivery time good. Delivery person WORST EVER. I paid on CC BUT I always tip cash,  when driver looked at screen his comment  was what no tip for driver. This infuriated  me and I informed  him he wasn't getting one and I showed him the $3 in my hand.His reply I was just joking. NOT FUNNY. Food was actually  good.It gets better I called customer service was asked my phone# and major intersection. Was told  no order for my number and we don't deliver there? I called the 310-1010 # he said i should call main number. I finally called a # which  was in the US. That was the only person who was empathetic. I have ordered many times from this restaurant  but never again. There are 5 pizza restaurants  at least  between  my place and store.One star cause I couldn't  give mone
2536;Literally worst experience ever.. Billy Jean, worst employee I've ever met.. After messing up my order she chose to be aggresive and deffensive, repeatedly(on the phone and in person).. I brought the incorrect pizza back to the store, explained that there was no need for rudeness(oh the rudeness) I said I'm sorry and I  understand your system wasn't working, suggested she escalate it to management, to which she replied "well its all fixed so you have no reason to complain"..unreasonably rude with no apology or acknowledgement of messing up my order..she's either a child that has no place in the work place, or not someone that should be in a position that interacts with people
2537;Totally watered down coffee.  Had it replaced, same thing, ok taking my money though.
2538;Just waited a half hour in the drive through from the time we ordered to paying!!! Ridiculous!!! And it's not like it was busy....there were only a few cars ahead of us.....Very frustrating experience and definitely not going to go back there! At least the young man handing us the food at 2nd window apologized for the wait.
2539;This place suck's, came here with friends several month's ago and can still remember the poor quality and service. A Sunday evening, barely no one there. Group of 7, orders were incorrect, one order missed 4 times, food was cold and my dish had a piece of hair in it. The waitress was useless and didn't care about her job. Food was late and don't plan on returning. Found better establishments else where in the neighborhood.
2540;What happened to the wings at this place! utterly the worst wings we ever had there.....must of changed the supplier for wings or pissed the suppliers off as I dont know if I was eating pigeon wings.....wings used to be plump and crispy ( i think breaded as well).....man what a waste of money .....sorry wild wings, will not be going back
2541;Tried to order on March 18th. A guy answers and asks if I can hold. Leaves me on hold for over 5 minutes. I decide to call back and nobody answers my calls for over 15 minutes. I decide to start making a dinner at home just in case (while still calling them to see if I someone will pick up the phone). I make a full dinner at home and still nobody picks up the phone. So for over 45 minutes now this restaurant has not taken a phone order during prime dinner hours do they not think that might be odd and should check their phones?The wings are not that great to begin with but I had a craving for wings. In this economy forget ever getting my business. I'll go out of our neighborhood to pick up good wings.
2542;Don't even bother. Really poor quality - wings were over breaded with almost no sauce on them, most pathetic side of fries I've ever seems (10-15 fries!!!?) and literally a single carrot and piece of celery as the "side of vegetables and dip." Clearly the kitchen staff is being told to skimp out by the owners. Huge disappointment.
2543;Terrible service!! I came here Sunday night(jan 31/16) a little after 6pm. There were only 2-3 other customers in the restaurant. My family and I sat down and were presented with menus. The waitress didn't take our drink order. We waited 20 minutes for her to come to our table before I went up to the bar to find her. She was busy texting on her cell phone. I told her my family and I were ready to order. She said "OK". I asked if she could please come to our table to take the orders, said said" OK " again. We waited an additional 10 minutes and she still didn't show up. We decided to leave. As we walked out the door we saw her behind the bar on her cell again. This is unacceptable considering there were only a few other customers in the place. Avoid this place, they don't deserve your patronage. We ended up going to Wild Wings on St Clair near Runnymede instead.
2544;Been here a few times now.Bar staff always good. Wings are good but the rest of the food should be skipped.Ordered "nachos" in the description "layers of cheese"  what we got was nacho chips with a sprinkling of cheese.We actually sent them back!  We were told once they came back that the "recipe" calls for 4oz of cheese and it was now doubled.  They still had no cheese.We were told that the manager would not do anything about this since the "recipe" had now been doubled for the amount of cheese.  But she could knock off 50%.The "cook" had a dress shirt on so I suspect he is also the owner and only cares about his bottom line of profit.Hoping a real sports bar opens in the area.I don't care to support places that offer a sub par product for premium prices.
2545;I only review when things are good or bad. If its middle of the road, I don't waste my time. The Good - $9.99 Cdn pitchers on Saturday The Bad - hands down the worst chain pub food I've ever had. Im not going to go into details, if you can imagine what "chain" pub food is, this is it to a T. I'd be willing to guess that within 12 months of Oct 5th 2013 this location will no longer  be in business. I knew better before going in, unfortunately it was 8pm the LCBO was closing and I needed to eat before drinking.
2546;Crappy. I've been here before on numerous occasions and although I've been patient enough, I've walked in and had to wait five or more minutes to be seated...because nobody is around. Second, their sauce sucked! Not sure what happened but they watered down their wing sauce big time! I ordered Honey Blues..which is supposed to be honey garlic sauce topped with thick blue cheese dressing....where's the blue cheese (from pic) And the honey garlic sauce tasted bland - like a watered down syrup. When the new ownership came it was still okay and I ate here and was served by one of the new owners who did perfect. I don't know what happened and I am so mad that I wasted my money and said nothing. I just felt bad for them. Bring your sauce back and don't jip your customers. Your sauce is what makes you guys unique.
2547;This place is seriously the worst. Just go anywhere else. The nachos are pure comedy genius.
2548;Can I give 0 stars ?? Worst service I've ever had!! Are u even trained?? I've never laughed so hard after leaving a place because of being so insulted. I have told so many people not to go there because of the rude people working this place. ....sad
2549;Shitty overcooked burger. Ate 1/3 of the burger and nothing else.  Couldn't eat more. Sent it back. They didn't take it off the bill. Won't be back. Glad to see the manager is so concerned about food that gets sent back uneaten.  Suggest you avoid.
2550;Nice waitress (Nicole) crappy food. Slow. Rotten veggies in stir fry. Limp oily chips. Cold spinach dip. Won't go back.
2551;Worst service ever. Brought wrong meal to my girlfriend by the time her meal arrived i had finished mine. Service was slow and understaffe.salad tatsed like vomit.
2552;I was here a few weeks ago with my boyfriend. We walked seated ourself in the bar area. The bartender approach us for a drink.  We ordered and that came quickly. Then we ordered dinner . Our dinner took 30 mins and when it arrived mine was cold. I waited for the waitress to come back normally it's about 2 mins after your food arrives, to check how everything is.  I waited for 30 mins . Nobody came over  . I went to the dining room  to look for someone working their and nothing.  Finally I found someone and asked to speak to a manager , only to find out there wasn't one working that night. The server came over after I was speaking to another girl and  said. " I hearing somethings wrong.  I explained my food was cold and I was waiting for her to come over to get a new plate. She offered new fries. At this point my boyfriend was already done eating which no explained to her. She rolled her eyes and walked away.The service here was discusting   I would never return to this resturaunt .
2553;Worst wings I've ever had quesadilla was soggy and the flavours weren't very great there was also a hair in it we also waited for over 40 minutes to get our drinks as well as an hour and thirty on top of that for the food... Never again
2554;The WORST Taco Bell in Toronto Ive ever been to. I am so glad to be the first person to give them a review. In 2010 I ordered 2 soft beef tacos from them. I ate the first taco without any problems but the second taco smelt off. So, I took it bad and they said its the sauce. Anyway, they made me a new one. That same night I got seriously sick and was hospitalized. I learned the meat was not cooked properly. For 2 years I refrained from eating any Taco Bell. Until 2013 I took a risk and tried it again, but a different location. I'm not going to lie it was so amazing. That same week I gave the Malvern Taco Bell a second chance and I found a strand of hair in it. I was so mad. I've heard many bad things about this Taco Bell location. I'm surprised its still open as we speak. I wouldnt advise anyone to eat from them.
2555;Yuck. The only thing good about my meal was the tap water in a big cup she gave me. Thought I would do the less fatty route during the shopping break at Sherway, but now, I highly recommend the rest of the food court than this (and New York Fries has Butter Chicken Poutine)but I digressThis one is owned by some Mandarin/cantonese speaking people. But I wouldn't think this affected the food. I got a Pad Sew Vegetarian (description says large rice noodle, broccoli and something that's crossed out)I also asked for this in medium spicy. What I got was this soy sauce (too much) covered noodles with little bits of broccoli, old cabbage and carrots, and some weird things that looked like tofu. And on a plate no less. (tip: do not say you will eat there. the box is much cooler "to go" and you don't see the awful presentation)It tasted salty and nasty. I could have done better at home.
2556;I try to make healthy choices, so Thai food is a good decision. I sometimes go to Thai express and went to the ones downtown Toronto. They were ok. Today, I chose to go to Thai Express when in the mall in Sherway Gardens, Etobicoke. I noticed right away the meal was made in less than two seconds and it looked sloppy and pale. I asked the fellow ... 'it's done already" ?... he just replied "yes". I looked down at the sloppy mess and decided I would try it. Well it tasted worse than it looked. I mean how hard is it to swish around some veg and some chicken, spray some sauce on it in a wok and make a reasonable product ? Anyway, my advice is to stay away from this place, the staff really have contempt for the customers. YUCK FOOD.
2557;Seriously, save your money and go somewhere else. I know its just KFC / Taco Bell, but they too should have at least a minimum satisfaction standard. Yep, every single time we have had the misfortune of stopping here, while attempting to get something edible, we have been so incredibly disappointed. Grease alley (The Queensway) has a whole stretch of fast food places that are better, cheaper and faster than this. The hot dog stand at the Canadian Tire across the parking lot is a safer bet. Oh, and don't bother complaining... pretty sure our e-mails and voice mails were sent to the Bermuda triangle.
2558;Why is everybody complaining? This is hilarious! This is Taco hell... This is garbage food, how can you be surprised when you eat a bag of ?!This is not Mexican food at all! This is disgusting!   I suggest you take a few extra dollars and actually try real, fresh authentic Mexican food and you'll be ashamed that you ever walked into a Taco hell let alone stopped to review how nasty your garbage food was !!!
2559;By far the slowest service of any Taco bell I've been to. Average wait time per car in the drive thru at lunch ours is over five minutes. I had three cars in front of me and waited nearly 20 minutes, ridiculous!. It's always the same older Indian lady at the window and she clearly gets flustered any time the have a few cars in the line. Hire new staff!
2560;Disgusting! DO NOT GO HERE- Service is lousy and food is inedible.  I had fond childhood memories of Swiss Chalet- this place did not serve those memories well AT ALL.  Try the Paramount next door but stay clear of this pathetic excuse of a dining place.
2561;I've been to this location twice now. Honestly, when you're stuck flying through Terminal 3 and you're hungry, you don't have much choice. Both times I've been here I had the same server who looks like she walked straight out of a 60s diner with her platinum blonde hair tied loosely in a bun, bright red lips looking like she's chewing gum, and careless service that takes forever.The first time I was here I had some chicken wings and it was awful.The second time I was here, they were out of dark meat and we had their quarter chicken and hot chicken sandwich. Their quarter chicken is normal, I guess, but the chicken sandwich was...wtf...two pieces of bread, untoasted, and pieces of dry white meat, and a cup of gravy that you pour on there...for $10! I can make that in my sleep...They need better restaurants in this place...really, is terminal 3 that neglected?
2562;I wish my fiancé and I had read the previous reviews on Yelp before we ended up wasting 40 minutes waiting in the 'express' line at this location today.  We wanted to grab a meal here before he checked in.  After knowing we had less than 1 hour for the meal, the waitress recommended us to go in the express line, where the customers put the order themselves just like at a fast-food franchise.  Therefore, we placed our order at the so-called 'express' line.  I waited at the counter since it is self-service while my fiancé took care of the luggages and saved us a table.  We ended up waiting for 40 minutes and having to cancel the order as my fiancé had to catch his flight.  It was a very frustrating experience. My fiancé had an extremely busy day at work and didn't get time to eat lunch. We were expecting to have a nice quick dinner together before he left for his conference over the long weekend. We ended up wasting 40 minutes at this place and feeling starving and frustrated after.  The manager was very quick 
2563;Max's Scarborough, I found out has two websites. I wonder if they made this second site because of my not so good review which was the only one as well on that web site.
2564;I don't know where to start. I will get to the point. NOT SATISFIED!!!! Food is expensive, they serve you with small portion. It really feel like you're in the Philippines because the serving was really Philippine style. We order for two, but we get the food it was good for one person. It's so a shame!!! MARK MY WORD! THEY WONT LAST!!! If they want customer keep coming back. Serve the food that deserve our dollar. This will be first and last. I think it's better to buy Chinese food. They give you more for your $$
2565;Totally disappointed and a real bad experience.  We happened to be in the Scarborough area and walked in to Max's Filipino restaurant. It's set up like a fast food.  But they actually take your orders except it is a very slow service.  The place was not even full.  Only 5 tables occupied. I had to wave to get attention.  We were about to walk out since we were totally ignored.  Thought we try this place and stayed. We ordered crispy pork hock, kare-kare and garlic rice. The crispy pata came first.  It was okay but no dip came with it.  Kare-kare came in a black pot full of sauce, 5 pieces of tiny meat and no veggies priced at $19.00. We complained and the server told us that this is how they serve this dish.  Wow!  If this restaurant is using the famous trade name Max's, I suggest that they better evaluate this location.  This is way way below standard and it is not worth the money dining here.
2566;Ridiculously overpriced for Filipino food. It wasn't even great, it was just typical Filipino dishes. I've tasted way better ones elsewhere. We ordered spring rolls and they came out burnt (the ends were literally black). We asked if this could replaced with well cooked ones but the waitress said that's normal. I'm pretty sure anyone...even if they're not familiar with spring rolls.. would recognize it as burnt. They refused to change it so we just sliced off the charcoal ourselves. Their chicken was a bit dry. The vegetable dish was bland. However, the only food I truly enjoyed here was their halo halo. I would give their halo halo 4/5. Other than that it's a 1 for food and the slow service.
2567;Very very bad, lazy, slow service. The servers took an hour for our food to come to us. On top of that, their floor were very dirty with a lot of spills on the floor. Tables were not clean upon arrival and still not done (30 min in our stay) TERRIBLE. AVOID THIS PLACE. SERVICES SUCKS.Over an hour and still no foodAnd I have no cutlery or napkins. No NOTHING. So terrible. There is hardly any staff here working. Just two servers/cashiers. Our server was very rude and had a very sarcastic tone towards my family. Very impolite.
2568;Poor customer service!Ordered halo halo (7.99) for pick upI went in and the cashier did not even acknowledged my presence. Just left.Server name who did that is Kessler (his name plate)
2569;Been here a few times and not sure I'll be going back again... Everytime I go there, they have a massive amount of chicken rotating on the spit...  But when I order, rather than shaving chicken off the rotisserie, they reheat some old pieces on the grill. So the chicken is never fresh. Is that pile of chicken rotating there even real? Maybe it's plastic? Oh, and I don't like how they prepare food with their bare hands. Completely lost my appetite after having my Pita prepared with hands that a moment earlier was scratching arse. PUT SOME GLOVES ON!!! Much preferred the old Pitalicious. Better food, cheaper prices, and nicer staff...
2570;The food is actually inedible. The dressing they use on the shawarma is the same as on the salad, tastes like watered down mayo. The rice is undercooked and has no flavour. The chicken is undercooked and has no taste. Their croutons are old deep fried pita chips. They put sumac on everything but even this bold spice can't mask the gross tasting food. Osmow's if you're reading this and care about your business, just give up or get a chef with some credibility.
2571;This has to be the worst pita establishment. The service and food are TERRIBLE.  If I could give 0 or less stars I would...... do your stomach a favour....PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE
2572;I just went to this place !!! Omgggg horrible , horrible food , horrible place !!!! I got chicken shawarma- was cold , no taste. And the worse part nobody was wearing freaking gloves !!!!! I swear I saw a young guy ( who was making my shawarma )  "massaging"my sandwich , no gloves , with his fingers inside my sandwich !!! Disgusting! Don't go there !!!
2573;First of all, they couldn't get the order right!  We were ordering to go and typical my husband, he wasn't paying attention so we didn't realize the error until we got home.  My husband ordered and paid for chicken kabob and they gave him shawarma. The worst part is their was no taste.  There was no sauce!  Barely any toppings.  Probably the tiniest shawarma I've ever had.  And the chicken was mushy.  There were no pieces of chicken for that matter.  It was one mushy mess.  The texture was so off that I even questioned if it was really chicken!  The falafels were sour.  Maybe I'm used to ones with cilantro and parsley and there are other recipes as this one had more of a potato texture. They were perfectly crispy on the outside but the inside were sour and oily.  Definitely a disappointment.
2574;Went here for lunch, and ordered a chicken shawarma. Got potential food poisoning afterwards. I believe it must be the fact that they don't wear gloves and say they wash their hands. Though how throughly they must have washed their hands is debatable.If you really want to go to osmow's, go to another location.
2575;Deceitful. I went during lunch (12:30) and was awestruck to see that they used leftover meat laying on top of a heating block rather than cut fresh chunks off the skewer. The meat was bland, dry and tasteless - though the proprietor tries to mask this by pouring gallons of sauce on top.What a joke.
2576;I've heard a lot about Osmow's so I was quite excited when a new one opened up close to work. I gotta say it was very disappointing. First off they charge you $8.00 before tax for what they call a 'super' sandwich and there was nothing super about it. They double wrap the sandwich (two pita's) so you'll fill up on bread. The chicken  was not cut fresh and was reheated and the bread was old and falling apart, So much so that I couldn't properly enjoy my 'super' sandwich. My total for a shawerma and a bottled drink was almost $12. Definitely not worth the money!
2577;Walked in at 9pm on a Wednesday night and thought the location closed at 10pm. Apparently the hours from Mon-Wed are only til 9pm. There were a few customers inside getting food but as soon as we approached the guys behind the counter just shook their heads and said no. To be completely honest if people are still walking out with food then I think good customer service would have been to serve us as well and then turn their sign to close. Clearly this location needs to work on that. I won't be coming back here.
2578;The guy there was handling cash and food simultaneously without washing his hands. I don't think i'm coming back.
2579;Been letting a bit slip past these few times, but the last time I went here, I ordered a chicken shwarma. The gentlemen in front of me had changed his order and didn't want his chicken shwarma anymore... he made it specifically to what the gentlemen wanted...and I looked up at the workers...and in my head I was like oh helllll nawwww he's not gonna just pass over his chicken shwarma over to me....but guess what, he did! His coworker took over and started adding my "selected" toppings and added it in the same shwarma the other man didn't want. So while he continued to give the other man "excellent" service (because his fellow company was raving how good Osmow's was sooooo good), he continued to give me ruddy service. I really like the food here, and whatever, I accept the shwarma, because I didn't want it going to waste. But they also really need to start using gloves. As a nurse myself, I think that's super unhygienic esp. when they keep touching the tongs in the kitchen, and then dip their hands back into th
2580;I've gone to this place 4 times and 2/4 times, the shawarma had very minimal chicken in it and the didn't full the sandwich with enough toppings. The entire sandwich was 75% bread with barely any meat. The first time I went, they really packed in the meat and toppings and it tasted great and then the last few times their service and quality went down the drain. My ultimate pet peeve at restaurants is when the food quality is not consistent some days the sandwich looks well worth eating and other days it's just a roll of bread with barely any toppings. Shawarmas are supposed to be packed with meat and toppings. This place decided to cheap out. After 4 experiences, I'm not going to give this place anymore business. The food should look the same and taste the same every time but unfortunately most of the time they cheap out on the filling.
2581;So one late afternoon, the hubby and I went to the Osmow's location in Richmond Hill to give it a try.  I was actually craving Greek food that day, but they were closed, so we decided to check out Osmow's.  It was pretty quiet when we arrived, but thats most likely because it was after the normal lunch hour.  We ordered one of their infamous chicken on the rocks, and a chicken shawarma sandwich (regular sized).  As we were waiting for our food, I noticed that they were not cutting the chicken off of the spit, but they were reheating chicken from one of those metal rectangular containers on their flat top.  I shrugged it off, thinking that it was because they wanted to make sure that the meat was hot for us.  We got our food shortly after, and I dug into my shawarma.  I noticed that the chicken did not have those crispy bits that usually you get from roasting on the spit.  I then took a look and noticed that the meat was this greyish colour.  All dark meat or just sitting meat?  Meat was also gristly.  I had t
2582;Don't go. Save your time and money and your appetite. The place looks unkept. The chicken was dry and not edible. My kids called it cardboard. The rice was dry and clumpy. I can't erase the memories it was that bad. I purchased take out and ended up throwing out the food. Totally lost our appetite. Why do they serve patrons the dried up chicken in a heating plate that's probably been sitting out all day? They don't shave the meat off a fresh shawarma rotating skewer like other places do. They have one on display but I suspect it's fake and for show. Please don't go. While I don't like giving such poor reviews in this case it's completely warranted.With so many other delicious shawarma places like MA VA ME and Sofra and hannas this place is a disgrace. It's a shame because we need a decent shawarma place further east.
2583;What a disappointment! As a regular customer to the location in Mississauga, I was so happy to see this chain open in Richmond Hill BUT after several lack lustre visits we finally had the meal that broke the camel's back. My husband picked up takeout and brought it home for dinner. We found not one but THREE hairs in our meals! Disgusting! We threw away our dinners. Then turned to our baklava hoping to have at least a decent dessert - WRONG! It tasted and smelled like a pickled salad. Another trip to the garbage bin. We called the store and was promised the manager would call back, never an apology on that call. No call back from the store and its been a month. You have lost 2 customers !
2584;Worst food I have ever had in my entire life.. disgusting. No flavour, barely any meat, mixed up orders, and very COLD.. horrible service.
2585;I LOVE Osmow's and was super excited to find out there was one close to home. I typically have gone to the Courtney Park and Queen st. location. I picked up dinner for my family and was extremely disappointed. I have always eaten chicken on the rocks, one of their most popular dishes. The rice was overcooked and mushy, the chicken was crumbled bits vs. slices of shawarma, and they didn't spice it as I had requested, although mentioning I had eaten it many times before. It was a gloppy mess. Will not be eating at this location again.
2586;Doesn't even deserve a one star!!! I tried beef plate and i was disgusted! First i asked if i can taste the beef and he said no because beef is very very expensive!!!! I thought I would give it a try anyways even though my husband told me he hated this place!!! Old shitty food for $15 i could eat at a fine restaurant! I wanna throw up when I think about it! This business with that food and management is gonna go down soon!!!
2587;It's dirty, dingy, and on the side of sket-CHY!. I'm not sure if this place even has a PASS. The place was rather empty when we went. [Disclaimer: We were here late and wanted shawarma. My boyfriend figured it was time to try a different place, and this place was it.] Only a few people were having shisha (all from the same table). There were a few other people in the corner playing pool and drinking beer.The place doesn't appear to know what it wants to be. A bar? A shawarma place? A shisha place? An actual restaurant? Who knows with their setup! They have a few pool tables, coin-slot game machines, and a few tvs.  The tables were not cleaned. There weren't any clean tables in the entire place. The restaurant owners don't appear to be very interested in the upkeep of the place, both in terms of customer service or the appearance of the restaurant. The service was slow. The people that work at this place were not rude, but appear to be rather apathetic. We sat in the patio. We ordered our shawarmas. 
2588;This is the worst place I have ever been to for shisha. It's run down and dirty and their shisha tastes like shit. STAY AWAYYY
2589;The shisha selection is quite bad, all we could choose from was strawberry and rose which both are very hard flavours and are really strong. The food my friend ordered a shawarma and the other got a burger. Burger was cold. Shawarmas were quite bad very soggy and cold. The service is very bad, and they are understaffed. No one will come to your table. And I swear there was a really big fat dead guy on the couch right in front of the entrance. He never moved an inch when we were there for couple of hours. Also the place is very dirty. Will not be coming back
2590;dude this restaurant really needs to cleen their shisha pipes, dirt dirt dirt, like crap the couches are nice i geuss but seriously i the dirty shisha pipes really make me cringe do they even change the water frequently. also it takes them wayyyy too long to make a damn shwarma 20+ minnutes. i really don't like how they have the same music track playying every time too, like ughhhh pitbull all day t__t
2591;Epic fail.Unbelievable really. Walked in on a Monday around lunchtime. Nearly no one there. Ordered a couple of chicken shawarma sandwiches and were invited to sit. And sit we did. And we waited. And waited. And waited. And walked away. How it would take twenty minutes to get shawarma is beyond me.Don't waste your time.
2592;Would give no stars but app won't let me. Disgusting! Was once owned by wonderful italian family. New owners have no respect for the health of their customers.
2593;As shown in the picture. This boy is laying and climbing on the counters with bare feet. The owner when confronted with this says its Ok. Disgustingly dirty people. ENJOY THE PIZZA!
2594;I have eaten here many times as my husband works down the road. The customer service has never been very good since the new owners but it was on the way home. The new owners are very rude, definitely not friendly people. The pizza itself isn't very good. 3/5 stars honestly but we ate there since like I said it was on the way home.I can say now though that those photos of the child being on the table I will definitely never eat at this establishment again though.
2595;This is the place on the news with the youtube video going around of the barefoot kid laying on the counter.  I defiantly would not eat any food that came from this place.
2596;It's gross. Kids are running around barefoot in there climbing and jumping. The pizza was nasty.  Kill it with fire. Go to Venezia pizza 8 mins down the road. Way better
2597;Horribly dated and sketchy. This is the kind of place that you would only visit if there were no other options in the immediate area.Having been in here in the past, it's clear that the owners of this BK on Burnhamthorpe Road have never bothered to upgrade the place. It still sports the same dated look that it had 15 years ago, with the only caveat being that they installed a couple of flat-screen televisions in the interim.The food is the same quality that you'd find at any other BK - absolute bottom-feeder deals that only appeal to the drunk or those with low standards. I suppose I shouldn't talk, considering that the only reason my friends and I came here in the first place is because it was Canada Day weekend. They were one of the only places open and they were selling $1.50 chicken sandwiches in "honor" of Canada's 150th birthday. Like McDonalds, it's the kind of food that will make you regret eating it 15 minutes after you finish.The staff are pleasant enough, but you can tell that they aren't all
2598;There was mold on my breakfast sandwich bread. It also took a while to get the attention of the workers who were all in the back. It wasn't me either. I also saw other people yelling "Hello?!" while waiting in front of the cash register and no one would respond. Eventually a cashier would show up to help, but the mannerism of not acknowledging that they had heard someone ask for assistance is a bit odd.
2599;I ordered TWO burgers. How do you fuck that up?!?!! They gave me completely wrong burgers. Wow
2600;I am giving a bad review because I would love the cooks to speak english. I have ordered from this location a few times, and when they make an error I have tremendous difficulty talking with the cook who made my pizza because his english is so poor. They should change the name of this pizza pizza to "India Pizza" because all the employees are indian. And I mean brand new to the country. The manager/owner of this location takes money from the employees if a customer complains about their pizza. I'm pretty sure that is illegal, but the new immigrants/refugees here are not educated enough to call the ministry of labour. This is a sad sad place to work. I feel sorry for the employees, but I am upset they cannot speak english. And they keep putting on the wrong type of sauce and cheese on my pizzas! Why can't the owner/manager just hire high school kids like McDonald's instead? I guess high school kids know about their rights.
2601;If you order from this location they send the most weirdest and rudest drivers to deliver your pizza...and that makes me question if my pizza is safe to eat :$
2602;Worst pizza pizza location in mississauga w/ regards to customer service. The delivery person sent from this location is consistently rude to the customers. Though I filed a complaint and got my full refund, i also suspect that this person tampers with the food in some way to non-tipping customers so i had pizza pizza take the delivered food back.
2603;Worst customer service ever. I ordered my pizza at 11:50pm after checking they it would be open till 2am, and received a confirmation email saying it would be ready in 15. As I got there, it was closed. Granted it was a day after a holiday, but they couldn't have the decency to just call and be like "Hey sorry for the error, but online it says 2am but we close at 12am today." All would be good, but the fact I get there and they refuse to open the door for me to even talk to them. Terrible. I try calling customer service, and no one can pick up the call for 30 minutes. What if I had paid online? Would I just lose my money? I'm never eating this trash again. And no one else should, go somewhere else worth it like pizza nova, or mama's pizza which are located close by.
2604;This is the worst pizza pizza place. They are too cheap on the toppings. I barely have any cheese or toppings as I'm just eating tomatoes and bread. I don't even call this as a pizza place.
2605;The food was not as I expected from Mr. Greek, we ordered 4 different dishes but none came out the way it should have. The dessert baklava was at least a month old to the point it was rancid but they thought by putting it in the microwave it can be served. A big disappointment all together!
2606;The service, pricing and speed of service you would expect to come from Mr. Greek does not apply to this run down location.  The lack of enthusiasm from the cashier made me wonder of she had a pulse until te phone rang. She picked up the phone and forgot we had existed for a minute. When the time came to pay we were quickly interrupted by an upset waiter. He was upset he couldn't break a $100 bill for a table he was serving.  This may be because the customer did not expect the over inflated prices normally not found at other locations. The takeout window did provide for some entrainment as when meals were picked up the waiters decided to pick from the plate and eat as they delivered the customers meals. Overall the experience was so horrible that after eating out over 100 times this year already I felt it was nessasary to finally create an account to share this experience. I'd review the quality of the food but it's been 15 minutes since we ordered from the take out menu and I don't think we are goi
2607;Very disappointing!  Poor attitude of manager. As a regular customer of a few years I would expect to be treated better. After all if it was not for paying customers this business would not be open!  This will be my last visit to this place! They just kissed  $2500.00/year in business!
2608;Very disappointed. I went for a birthday dinner and the waiter was impatient, rude and then has the audacity to add on gratuity tip included in the receipt. First, service was horrible by the waiter named Theodore and then he added tip which is above 15% into the receipt. Never did he come to us, not even once during the meal to refill our cups, and when placing our meals in front of us, he unnecessarily placed it harder unto the table. When taking our orders, he rushed us and never even smiled until we made a complain to the manager. IF, most likely wont, I ever do come back I'll be definitely asking for a different waiter.
2609;Not very happy with the service here today...we ordered a bagel, 3 hashbrowns and two coffees. After our order they said they only had two hashbrowns and would give us a cookie...asked for an oatmeal raisin didn't have that...ended up getting a croissant I didn't really want...to top it off...my mom asked for a medium decaf coffee with two cream one sugar...she got a BLACK coffee with two sugars...not impressed...
2610;I've heard the boss yell at his mostly immigrant female staff. I was so offended, I left.
2611;They always get my order wrong plus they burn their coffee. I'd rather wait in line for a better cup of coffee then to be rushed through.For some odd reason my order isn't as bad as long as I drive through.
2612;It's like every other Tim's, but the drive tru is the priority, you are better off going there
2613;As the other review pointed out, the service at this place is beyond awkward.  When I entered the place, there was a girl on the phone behind the counter, and not another person in sight.  No other customers.  I asked if it was open it was hard to tell.  She seems genuinely surprised to see a customer, at least that was the impression she gave me. I wish I would have just left.She said I could sit anywhere.  Now, the restaurant is actually a physically nice space.  From the street view, one would not anticipate how nice it is inside.  Although, being empty, it had a very weird vibe.  Classical music played loudly on the speakers.  It is rather dark. There are too few tables for the amount of space.  It was weird, but also nice and clean.The menu I was given was a crumpled and dirty, plastic covered, binder clip bound paper.  Some menu items were crossed out in pen.  Prices were crossed out with new prices scribbled in their place.  She placed the menu in front of me, and stood two meters away, staring aw
2614;I had a bad feeling walking in because at 7 pm on a Friday night, we were the only ones in the place. The only reason why this review gets one star is because the food was actually good. The service was beyond bad, actually laughable, The "waitress" was the rudest server I ever encountered. She was absolutely no help in making suggestions, did not even know what the appetizers were when she brought them to the table, nor did she offer to ask. Tea was brought to us cold. When asked to warm it up, was told that wasn't possible. When I asked to put in the microwave, she came back with hot water. And the final, most shocking and angering part of the evening, is when she came back to the table three times to see if we had paid. We left the money on the table and began to leave, when she very rudely asked us if we paid. I WILL NEVER GO BACK. Clearly this is why they are empty.
2615;Just disappointing quality of food. Spent 35 dollars on nasty nachos and quesadillas. How do you mess up nachos!?
2616;Have been to this restaurant a few times before with my family and this is the second time where we have experienced horrendous service. The waiter was very slow and spent most of their time chatting with customers rather than serving them. The food (normally decent) was overcooked and burnt. I was very disappointed from my experience at this restaurant. I thought I had found a local go-to restaurant but sadly I was mistaken. I would not recommend this restaurant.
2617;I make better Chinese food that Honey Bee and I'm Latin! I went and got food from here today because I was very hungry and thought I'd try it. I asked if they had Kung Pao chicken and they said yes. I am wondering if they have ever eaten Kung Pao themselves. I got a large amount of celery with 2 miserable almonds and a little bit of chicken. I'm not exaggerating this. It wasn't good. How are they in business? :(
2618;This place for food is just ok. Me and my boyfriend went here one night after we found out that our regular chinese place was closed. It was a little over priced for what we got but not the worst I've seen, normally you would get more dishes for the price. However we were hungry and happily took our dinner home, we started eating and found the food to be quite bland although it might be good if you perhaps were intoxicated and were hungry. The food ended up even worse because my boyfriend found a long hair in his food - or should I say his mouth. Can we say GROSS? If there was no hair I'd probably give it a 2.
2619;Worst place I've been in a few years. Service is bad, food is below average and you can't even use the washroom even if you are a customer. City of Toronto should close this restaurant.
2620;Owner man is very rude , doesn't allow customer to use washroom short change me $5 addition to the original price. Your store soon go bankrupt.
2621;Food is bad and they tried to short change me.  Don't go, but if for some reason you have a gun to your head and must eat here...at least count your change.
2622;BRUTAL service- Ruined our night. We all know those nights when you are starving - at 6:30 I picked up the phone to order for delivery. Waited patiently for 45-50 minutes. Nothing. I called the restaurant to inquire, and the call taker told me the food was not ready?  They were busy. Then she said she would have to call the driver- I could not get a clear answer if the food was a) not prepared b) prepared, waiting for driver to pick up c) with the driver- on the way to us. She said she would call the driver, and call us back. She immediately called us back, thinking our phone number was the drivers- then, confused- she hung up. At this point arguments in my house amongst hungry people are starting to build . Got a call back 10 minutes later (now a full hour since I ordered) telling us the driver was on the way, assuring the food would be there in 15 minutes, but I should give her the visa number now - ummm, yeah- not going to happen. 15 minutes passed, and surprise, surprise - NOTHING. I called the re
2623;Worst customer service. Microwaved food and inconsiderate owners.  They messed up our order and refused a refund or exchange. Extremely rude staff.  Will NEVER go back.
2624;Use to think 5 stars but now no, good food but they have lost two long time customers. Not Service Dog friendly though they are reluctantly AODA compliant regarding them.
2625;Nothing on my 4.99 breakfast special plate tasted good. Manager was rude- asked for ketchup to cover up the taste and he said "come up here and get it"
2626;I wish there was an option on here for giving 0 stars because this place is really that bad. I guarantee that anyone who is familiar with Kensington market knows not to go to this cafe, especially when there are so many better alternatives in close proximity.Moving away from the sub par food/service/atmosphere mentioned in the other reviews, the owner of the cafe is one of the most two-faced jerks I have ever met. I suppose this review is becoming a little personal now, but I just want to warn others to not be fooled by his facade. I will not discuss the details of our interaction, but he was extremely rude, when the situation did not necessitate such a response. I will make it my personal crusade to save as many oblivious tourists from wasting their money at this place.
2627;I might have known when there were no cars outside. I ordered an Egg McMuffin and asked if there were any choices besides processed cheese. "No" said Sandeep.  "Then may I have one with no cheese please?" it arrives. it has a slice of processed cheese. I could see it through the wrapper.  I said "This one has cheese," She turned around and made another sans cheese.. "So you don't want cheddar?" she asked.  I said "I thought there were no other choices." Cheddar isn't pocessed, or they can't call it cheddar as I understand it." "They are all processed" she said.  Maybe I've been out of the country too long. When I started to eat the second Egg Mcmuffin, it was thinly sliced, barely there regular bacon, not the Canadian bacon I was accustomed to, which I could have dealt with, but after the second bite I realized, it was barely warm. So I returned to the counter and said to the lady, "Sandeep, feel this, it's almost cold." She grabbed it from me and opened the package saying "Aww, you've eaten half of it." Not 
2628;This is a small location in a busy mall. It is about as clean as a playplace and the food quality is subpar. If your really in a hurry then it will serve your needs but I cannot recommend eating in
2629;Cramped, dirty and small. Staff are rushed and rude. Took almost 10 minutes for a junior chicken combo.  My order was lost too. Didn't get a receipt either.
2630;I have been to several other Thai express locations and  I do like some of their menu options but this location ranks on the bottom for me.First, the service is very rushed and they will frequently get your order wrong. They also don't give you much meat and vegetables, it is mostly noodles. The broth also tastes watered down. It was convenient to have a location close to work but it is not worth it to order from here. Go to one of the many other food options nearby.
2631;I love Paramount but not this location.  To start, the customer service is poor. They took my order only after the server had to make it known to her counterpart about the latest snap chat conversation. The bread was made fresh but was undercooked. I ordered the hummus with falafel and the falafel was super salty.I wasn't too pleased with my experience at this location.  I'll just stick to the mississauga locations, as they focus on quality and great customer service.
2632;Shawarma was cold, falling apart and small. They also had NO ONIONS!!! Which shawarma place doesn't have onions? This location is BAD. I still like other locations though. Disappointed.
2633;Wanted to leave a review for the new location on Rutherford road and hwy 410, but, I'm assuming this location is equally shitty.  Wow!! What happened to paramount?! We used to go to the one on crestlawn in Mississauga, before they started expanding at a rapid rate.  I went on a Monday for the 2 for 1 shawarma deal, BIG mistake!  The wraps were tiny and even though one was free, I still feel ripped off! It was cold and had some kind of tomato sauce on it and like 5 small pieces of chicken! Sucked big time! I understand that the owner(s) has huge overhead because of the new stores opening every week!but, damn! The wrap was the size of a soft taco at Taco Bell, but, not as good and it tasted like there was tomatoe sauce on it?! Wtf? Too expensive for what you get.  I predict these locations will close just as fast as they open. Never again.  I want my money back. Absolute crap
2634;My gf and myself just had lunch here and paid $25.00 for a chicken shawarma and a chicken shawarma plate. The pita bread was brought without any condiments or dipping sauce. The shawarma was small, bland and without much flavour at all. The basmati rice tasted sour. When asked how we liked the food we told the truth and said it was bland and we were given a barrage of excuses including its a franchise we can't do anything. I mentioned the pita bread without any dipping sauce whatsoever, which was again given excuses that its our standard! I believe it's waaay overpriced and bland. Go to another middle eastern restaurant like Ali babas, for flavorful middle eastern food and shawarmas.
2635;Manakeesh pizza was decent but then I noticed the cashier/cook biting her nails and wiping her dripping nose with her hand. Avoid this place.
2636;Nothing fine about this place. Never again, overpriced and under quality.  Tried the chicken schwarma was way salty.
2637;Absolutely disgusting never eating their again the sauce was just horifying tasted like a rotten dead fish the rice tasted like 9lbs of butter the salad lets not even talk about the salad overall worse than a 1 star and over priced I'm actually scarred at the expirience
2638;Service is poor and so is their quality at this location. The order takes forever considering they are a mall location. Then you expect the food to be worth the wait which is totally not. Wouldn't recommend them, try their other locations.
2639;I had been wanting to try food from here forever and finally got the opportunity. However it was nothing memorable. The chicken shawarma plate was overpriced and the chicken was overcooked. I paid for extra sauce and still didn't get it. The chicken was also very scarce. Definitely not worth it
2640;Worst shawarma place to eat. Ever. The chicken was more like very dry and it was more like scraps. They try to over emphasize with the naan but who needs round naans? Rice was plain af. Salad was nothing to remember.the jalebi and other desserts was stale and gross. Better to eat at tandoori flame or osmos
2641;The food there is meh, have had better. The food needs a little more flavour. Price is way to expensive. Some staff are nice & helpful while others are extremely rude. Wouldn't recommend this particular place. Although most food isn't the greatest, their homemade bread & pizzas are pretty good & there Paramount special drink is something to try.
2642;We've been to many Sunset Grill locations. Most are slightly above average, a couple are great.This one stinks. Slow, plodding service, dirty tables, waiting 1/2 hour for a simple breakfast, dishwater coffee. Just had the wrong order plunked down on our table then got attitude. Paid for our coffees and walked out.Steer clear of this location.
2643;just ate here today and i must say it was one of the worst dining experiences I had. I had brought my mc donalds coffee not knowing I was not allowed to, there was no sign posted anywhere that no drinks were allowed. my server told me that the manger told me to throw it out and i literally just bought it. I asked if i can just put it in a mug and he said no. i thought maybe he can give me a coffee on the house because of the whole situation but no all the workers and the manager was just starring at me and my boyfriend during the whole time we ate which was so uncomfortable. my server brought our waters late, forgot my boyfriends whipping cream that was an extra $2 and forgot to get my toast until the end of my meal... lol wth?
2644;Saltiest pad thai of my life. Just awful. Wanted something less greasy than a burger, but should've gotten a sandwich from Tim Horton's.
2645;Looked interesting, but final product had taste of a microwaved gruel with MSG.Service was appallingly slow. Not sure they could move slower without moss growing on one side.Avoid.
2646;Horrendous. They were out of pretty much everything onthe menu. Excruciatingly slow service. Super salty pad thai. So salty that i couldn't eat more than a few bites.
2647;They basically don't have Bahn sandwiches . They have it on menu, but they don't have it !!! The service is so slow that by the time you get to the cashier, you end up ordering another dish because you were in line for 15 minutes.
2648;Do not eat here!!! I literally just threw away my entire disgusting noodle salad that tasted like salt and fish!! Horrible!!!
2649;I hate leaving bad reviews but this place needs new management. The wait was forever the food was terrible. The only good thing was the sushi, but I say good only because my starving kids finished it. The rice tasted old and it was too cold. The spice coconut spot was basically a rice Plate with tomatoes, pineapple and I chose tofu. It was too sweet. The drunken noodle soup was just awful. No flavor. Noodles weren't fully cooked. And it was served in a cheap thin, plastic container. Probably letting out all sorts of petroleum in the soup as it was about 200 degrees. Don't eat here.
2650;The foods are okay but the staff are friendly in your face but secretly giving Sign to other customers to look  at your face all the way down to your between-legs.
2651;This place sucks, it's the only KFC that I've ever been to that is out of chicken consistently - and this is at 8pm, not right before close. I have experienced incorrect orders through drive through at least 50% of the time. The guy that usually works the drive through is rude, been there forever, and won't give you napkins or sauces unless you ask. Take the drive to another location this place is tanking.
2652;It is currently 10:17pm and the website says the restaurant closes at 11pm. It isn't open. The client service here needs work. They are slow and always out of something.
2653;The worst service ever . I was waiting in drive through for 15 minutes  . I left my husband in the car and i walk inside to found 5 workers to talk . No one was in the  drive through window and when i ask  what is going on people waiting for you guys to serve theme manager turn to me and said  relax will you .Wow !!! I  never go back again   NEVER .
2654;This is the first time I have espresso at a Tim Horton and I'm sure this is the last!
2655;Worst customer service ever! No one smiles or even says "Hello" to you when you get to the front of the line or to pay at the drive thru window. At the drive thru window they simply hold out their hands waiting for you to give them money. They don't even mention the price. When they give you your change back, they don't say thank you or smile. When you ask them a question or ask for napkins/cup sleeve, they give you a dirty look like you disrespected them! Terrible customer service!
2656;We went into this restaurant tonight at 5pm and it was like walking into a blast furnace.  We asked if their air conditioning was broken and she told us it was on.  No wonder we were the only ones there at supper time on a Friday night.  The waitress asked us if we would like drinks and we asked for a glass of water.  She replied with we don't serve tap water. After looking over the menu I asked for soup of the day in which the waitress replied,  sorry we don't have soup today.  I then asked for jalapeño poppers and the waitress replied,  sorry we don't have poppers today. After we finally found something on the menu that they had,  my husband asked where the washrooms were.  The waitress told him that the washroom was out of service.  He said 'you're not serious' yes she was. Apparently they have been waiting on a plumber to arrive for 2 days.  She told him if he just had to pee just don't flush.  How discussing.  Needless to say I would never recommend this restaurant and it's obvious that others feel the s
2657;This resteraunt is never open dont waste your time they open maby if your lucky at noon or 4pm and close at 9pm or 10pm which is rear the worst resteraunt bar ever owners are lazy as hell i say false advertisement we will never step in there again they should just close it down they are worthless.We and a group of fruends went there in the past when they were doing karoke and we were rushed to finish our drinks so the owner could go do important things.
2658;I actually got food poisoning a couple years back from eating their chicken sandwich. Stay  away!
2659;Horrible service. I waited almost half an hour for 4 drinks. The place is also very messy. It seems as though no one ever cleans this place. I do not recommend this McDonalds. Never coming back.
2660;This is most definitely the worst location, service is unbelievably slow not matter what day or time. No matter if it's the drive-thru or, dine-in. They seem to always get my order wrong at this location as well. Tip make sure to always check your purchase before leaving !
2661;Overpriced. Rude staff.Extremely salty foods. Extremely salty attitude by staff on the phone.Very stingy with the gravy and cheese on fries and poutine. Very stingy with compensation. I was told I would get a free compensatory dessert because they forgot an item I ordered for delivery. Never did. When I called to inquire, I was given something free alright, rudeness.  Sticking with Pickle Barrel which has better foods and better staff.
2662;Terrible layout first of all. If you order anything other than a coffee and donut, you don't know where to pick up your order. It's made in behind where you can't see what's being done to your food. Ordered the breakfast combo number two. Hashbrown was tasteless and the bread was stale, hoping it hadn't expired. Ugh. Feel sick already. Staff was friendly though
2663;SUPER slow staff!!! They really take their time! In the mornings when time matters, and there are 3 long lines in the shop, they are moving so slowly, chatting to each other and don't even care. I don't understand how their manager is fine with this!!
2664;Bad food- yes it is possible to serve bad fries! Tasted like they had been made the day before! Chicken sandwich dry, left most of it. Average service.
2665;Horrible experience - service was very slow and the waitress did not listen to my order and brought me extras on a burger that I did not ask for. She kept trying to get me to buy bottled water and other things I did not ask for. She also brought my the wrong bill which was more expensive and I had to correct her. On my actual bill she changed me for extras that I did not ask for and refused to change it. I left filling ripped off There are lots of new restaurants in the new terminal 3, including fast food options that I'm sure would provide better service and I would suggest going there instead.
2666;Went to grab a meal before a flight. We waited about 20 minutes for someone to come to the table and offer water etc. The reason for the delay They received a poor review on Yelp and the entire wait staff decided to stand by the kitchen, bashing the reviewer and trying to figure out who it was and why they would complain. In this time we watched the hostess seat up to three tables, all of them were also ignored by the wait staff. This conversation was incredibly unprofessional and downright childish. These conversations should be saved for breaks or time away from the restaurant. The entire restaurant does not need to hear how "stupid and out to lunch" this reviewer was. Perhaps if you focused on your job people wouldn't complain.We were not told the specials and we were not checked on once outside of having our order taken. Our food came out after 45 minutes. It was cold and was essentially tossed on our table by the waiter, presumably so he could get back to his customer bashing session. Very unimpress
2667;Had the steak and fries. The steak had no flavour and the fries tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while.
2668;Well over priced, even for the airport. Food was bad, its just that simple. Your held hostage at the airport but walk over to gate B20 and hit the Tim's.
2669;The beer choices are awful, no craft beer here but what causes me to review and rate a one star is the bartender that served me on a recent afternoon on my layover. He was a bigot and making no secret of it. Speaking very loudly to anyone who would listen, about one of the managers. He found himself to be oh so clever as he altered her name to somehow reflect on her nationality. Every server that came to the bar was assailed with his bigoted views. He didn't smile, wasn't pleasant in the least. What you think of a tired, washed up airport bartender. Oh, and crappy beer too!
2670;Worst calamari ever! The portion was way too small, calamari was overlooked. You would eat the food only if you are starving.
2671;Please keep in mind that I hold a lower standard of service for airport restaurants, but this falls below even my low standards. I was connecting through Pearson, so I decided to have breakfast at Pearson. I had the "Canadian" breakfast, which was mediocre - as expected. However, the service was abysmal even for an airport. After I finished, there wasn't a server in sight. It wasn't busy there were only a few other patrons besides myself. The servers weren't in sight, but they were easily heard. They were (along with, I believe, the manager) gossiping loudly behind a partition. They were easily overheard by everyone in the restaurant. I wasn't in a hurry, fortunately. After a few minutes of overhearing their gossip (not by choice), I went behind the partition and asked my server for my bill. She brought out my bill and a wireless credit card reader. She then left me alone with the credit card reader! It wasn't hard to do on my own there were instructions on it. But what if I'd decided not to play nicely? Th
2672;Small Portions. Tasted just acceptable. Not so fresh tasting proteins. Steep prices.Owner was warm and friendly but that doesnt cut it.Increase portion sizes and change the recipes on the proteins
2673;Servers need to mention every customer : caution our reguler sizes are for kids only and adults are strictly adviced to order large portions. 2 teaspoon guacamole to any size burrito bowl is 2.95$. Chicken has no taste whatsoever! Beware everyone. There are many better similar eateries in Mississauga! Just drive 10 min more and go to Chipotle at Squareone, better quality and quantity too. For a second day of restaurant opening quality, quantity and customer care sucks! Just have good presentation, so they get 1 star.
2674;Stale and rancid food is sold here, when we notified the workers were not sure hoe to react obviously they work their and the owner never came on the phone .
2675;This restaurant only opened this week. Having been in the restaurant business for 20 years here's some advice:-get organized and increase line speed.  Look at the spatial arrangement of equipment and place it so it's no more than 3 steps away- get uniforms.  If you want to portray professionalism than have staff wear a proper uniform otherwise you are showing desperation by not treating your team properly- give awesome customer service including those that call. Telling a customer to phone back after a few minutes only to tell them you can't talk and hang up is totally wrong and uncalled for. A customer is a customer is a customer. I hope you never hang up on me when I order 200 burritos for a school lunch. - anchor your iPads and place your debit terminal on a stand facing the customer. My experience was terrible and it's obvious you didn't host a friends and family night to work out the kinks.-I'm a customer and demand the food be served quick, hot and right. My first visit and you failed on all
2676;its amazing that the order taker gives me several assurances after assurances when I ask her to verify and double check that the driver is definitely able to call me on my cell upon arrival to the address. But no way.the pizza I got didn't have italian sausage.. it had some stupid sliced salami and I know what I am talking about.the dressing for my salad was dead wrong. and the drinks were not what I ordered..all in all the guy showed up to piss the hell out of me and I am still pissed off... if they cant do something they should NOT say they are going to do it.. I just cant believe it.they did a darn good job to piss me off tonightI know one thing.. I will NEVER again do business with GINO's
2677;I find that the men who work here are very creepy. The pizza is mediocre...a little greasy. Had a pizza delivered once to my home, it was a younger indian guy, he was stumbling all around looked like he was drunk to me. Not good if he was drinking and driving.
2678;There was hair (not just one hair, like a bunch of hair) in my pizza, it was obviously hair from an Indian person, i'm a blond Caucasian definitely wasn't mine. When I asked them to fix the problem they accused me of trying to scam them, yet I walked out of the pizza place went to my car and literally came back 2 minutes later to show them. I'm blonde! the hair was black an matted!
2679;Ordered a couple pizzas from here since their special was better than other competitors. When they arrived, I noticed one of the boxes had oil leaking out of the bottom. As I opened it I realized the entire half of the pizza box was literally filled with some random oil and had soaked the pizza to the point where it was a soggy mess. The second pizza wasnt anywhere near as bad but still incredibly greasy to the point of staining the bottom of the box. Literally the most disgusting thing I've received from a delivery person, definitely will not be ordering from here again.
2680;When we first moved to the area we would have friends over and order pizza from Gino's every weekend. They had a walk-in special an extra large one topping and a dipping sauce for $9.99. I started having issues after we switched out our regular order of pepperoni for extra cheese instead, or sometimes double cheese (by paying for another topping). I mean, they were always a bit skimpy on the cheese, but to order extra, or pay for double, and get the same amount is not right. This happened quite a few times, so I decided to mention it the next time I called and put in an order. I told the lady taking the order to please note we have not been receiving enough cheese on our last few cheese pizzas. As in you could still see sauce everywhere. She said if we are ever not satisfied, we need to call and complain right away. We picked up our pizza, and AGAIN, the cheese was non existent. My boyfriend was hungry so he grabbed a slice while I called the customer service line. Once I got through, I explained what 
2681;We tried out this location as it's close to my in laws. We were very displeased. The store is understaffed - we waited 10 minutes for them to just greet us at the front. Second, the pizza was horrible - cold, barely any topping, dry, barely any cheese, dough not cooked properly...Very disappointed that we spent $50 at this location. We do not recommend this location and will now drive a little further and pick from another location.
2682;Called in an order for delivery, had to speak to 3 different people in order to find someone who could take my order. When I tried to order wings, they had no idea what I was talking about. Finally placed a fairly large order for 48 breaded wings and 2 large pizzas. The order took over 1.5 hours to be delivered. We called the store twice and were told the driver would be at our house "any minute". We ended up paying $68 for our $85 order upon recognizing the fact the food took a very long time, and that they gave us the incorrect dipping sauces. The driver left and we opened the wings and then realized that they weren't breaded... the menu clearly states that the wings are breaded. Overall, pizza was mediocre, wings were gross. Service and delivery complete failure. I will never order from here again.
2683;Hell no!  I was in the process of paying for my order.  I watched the person handle the money, then immediately started working on a pizza dough.  Caution: Food safety concern - eat at your own risk!
2684;To my shock and horror, the Quesada Mexican Grill in the Sheraton Centre was closed on a Saturday I went into work without a lunch. So, craving a burrito, and having left my jacket in my office, I decided to PATH it over to the Eaton Centre. There had to be some burrito place there.Ok, so this place in the food court looked decently clean so I stepped up to the counter and asked for a 10" burrito (the size I normally order at Quesada). I was told that this was a "snack size" and that for less than a dollar I should upgrade to the 12". I said I wanted the small. So the guy tells me it's "more for kids" and it's less than a dollar. Ok, I wanted to get back to work rather than continuing arguing, so fine.When I'm paying, the woman charges me for more than I thought it would cost. The receipt said I ordered a fish burrito. Less than a minute ago, the guy who prepped the burrito told her that I ordered chicken. I pointed this out to her and she pulls out an insincere "sorry" with a frown and practically throws
2685;I went to Mucho Burrito in the Eaton Centre Urban Eatery today. I've been to other ones thought I'd try this one for lunch. Ended up ordering a bowl which had all of the ingredients in a burrito but in a tortilla. The guy behind the counter took a plastic bin out almost like hidden under a counter and grabbed a handful of lettuce with no gloves and placed in my bowl. He then added grilled vegetables. It then had chicken added etc.  so I got back to work the cilantro wasn't cut properly so it was trying to eat sticks. The grilled vegetables were huge pieces and I was still thinking about the handling of my lettuce. All in all I was completely turned off by the lack of sanitary cleanliness I saw behind the counter. It was disgusting and 12 bucks. Please save yourself and eat at the Greek place that is packed a few steps by. This place wasnt busy so that should have been my first indication. I'm still debating to call a complaint into head office.
2686;This place is the worst mucho burrito I have been to.  I went on a Wednesday and paid full price for a 12 inch.Let's start off with the basics of why this place fails so hard:-Upsold immediately for something I didn't want (fine whatever that's normal I'll give them a pass).-Super cheap on the toppings.  Hope you like mainly tortilla.-Asked for further toppings and the server got a death stare from the manager like I was a begger asking for a free burrito.For $10 I would never go here again. Should have just went to chipotle. No wonder it wasn't busy.
2687;Such a stingy place.  I came at CLOSING and asked for extra vegetables and they gave me attitude like I was taking their natural resources and impacting their bottom line.  Forgive me for being a hungry mall wanderer!Pros:Quick service (No one was in line!)ConsStingyGave me attitude for asking for more. Like it was a handout.
2688;Toronto boasts no lack of burrito options. From international megacorporations, to local chains, to one-off mom-and-pop shops, you could safely dad-joke that Toronto puts the T.O. in burriTO. As burrito competition expands faster than a diner's waistline, you'd expect each shop to try and outdo the others in portion size, innovative menu items or plain old friendly customer serrvice. Sadly, this location of Mucho Burrito fails on every front. Located in the sprawling basement food court at the Eaton Centre, bored servers act as though they've got the market cornered when they barely have the South-West Corner of Yonge and Dundas.Signage is loud, and new specials are constantly on offer. Wanna try a ghost pepper burrito? It would melt your face off if they actually bothered using the right sauce. Questions about ingredients are met with indifference as they occasionally poke their sweaty proteins and swill-swimming beans in their steam trays. Sad scraps of produce mix between plastic containers 
2689;Avoid, avoid, avoid. There are about a hundred options in the area with better food, prices, and service. Not sure if the servers at this place are in a competition to see who can treat customers the worst. Like the poster below me, I would also give them a negative star if I could. YUCK.
2690;Expensive 4X than China Town food and component shortage!
2691;Just had the lady at the cash tell me "you have to learn to tell me how you want to pay"  this happened without her even asking me.  Needless to say my first experience with this place was not very good.  Food was mediocre also but after an experience like that i can barely be impartial.
2692;No star. Went to Square One Mississauga location and bought fish fillet with brocolli combo for take out. When i was eating there was hair on the brocolli. I went to the website to complain and they asked me if i still have the food or if I took a picture of the hair. NOPE. I THREW THE FOOD. HOW WILL I EVEN THINK OF TAKING A PICTURE OF THE HAIR WHEN I WAS SO UPSET FINDING HAIR ON MY FOOD??
2693;This taste like plastic!!  Just too pricy for the terrible taste. Plus one of the lady was rude to me. I didn't want any rice or noodles with my food but she insisted. She still put rice on it even when I  said I didn't want. I'd give a negative star if possible. Trust me, you're better of saving your cash and getting ruby Thai ( I always get ruby Thai. Something must have possessed me to deviate today) or a&w Just a waste really.
2694;Rude,  rude staff.   Kiosk out of paper,  rather than apologizing and fixing it...  Answer was you'll have to talk to the manager. ????  What?   Geeze I know you're only getting min wage but maybe you should just stay home.    Management also needs a big reset here.  Place is filthy,  floors are wet,  huge fall hazard.   Oh on the upside,  the food is way over priced
2695;Beware of this location:- filthy bathrooms- filthy dining area, food is not cleaned off tables- unmopped floors- staff is the laziest I've come across. Managers just do not care about their store. - I have a 4 year old so it's difficult to avoid the place. Send emails to the owners.
2696;Not impressed at all with the rudeness that my husband and I received from one of the waitresses there!First of all she wouldn't let me order anything off the festive menu, took the menu away from me and gave me an old one. Fine I ordered something else, then I noticed someone who came in later then me, got their food first and they received something off the festive menu, weird. Then I go to drink my coffee and the mug was the dirtiest coffee cup I have ever seen! The handle was sticky and there was food stuck to the inside of the cup and outside of it, gross! I go to ask for a new mug and the waitress is no where to be found, so I got the attention of another waitress that apologized and got me a new cup. The next thing that happened is the waitress purposefully asked another customer if he would like a refill while my husbands drink had been empty for a while now, she was clearly avoiding us.I am going to strongly suggest that you stay away from this location! We usually go to the Swiss chalet in Oa
2697;Worst delivery service I have ever experienced. Order took 1.45 minutes from time of order to my door. Tried calling customer service- and was on hold for twenty minutes. When order finally arrived, missing an item and their debit was out of service. DO NOT ORDER from this location.
2698;Try another location. This one is a disaster. Horribly slow. Waited an hour for a quarter dinner. Fries were in a cluster. Dressing was off. Stay away.
2699;This place ruins my childhood with this franchise...The rotisserie chicken is pretty good and standard and tastes the same in every swiss chalet since I was a kid, but by good god is the service one of the worst I've seen in the food business. On every occasion I've come here something terribly goes wrong for example:-Without a doubt you will be waiting at the door to be seated for at least 5 minutes even though the place is empty. The time for the server to come and take your order VARIES, sometimes it can be as fast as less than a minute or you might be kept waiting for 20, who the hell knows? The last time I came here was the absolute last straw, and will no longer give it second chances. I ordered the parm sandwich and my husband got a classic burger. When I ordered my parm sandwich, the waitress did not tell us it will take an extra long time to cook it and we ended up waiting for LITERALLY 30 MINUTES FOR OUR FOOD. After about 20 minutes I asked the waitress and she, in a condescending attitude, tol
2700;I have been to this location a number of times and the service is always awful. There is nobody to greet you at the door and it can take several minutes before you are noticed. The service is always slow so I've learned to order the specials. Today though was worse than ever. I ordered an appetizer and two specials. Half an hour later I didn't have our appetizer. It shouldn't take that long to get food at all - we should have already finished our appetizer and have received our specials by that time. We flagged down the waitress and she said she would check on it. She came back and told us it would be ten more minutes before the appetizer was ready. Forty minutes from order to food? Sounds to me like the order wasn't put in at all. Normally if I have issues I talk to a manager to get things straightened out. Today that was not an option. You didn't get the order wrong. You didn't forget something on my order. You forgot the whole order. I had got up and left. I will not be going back. If you really want Swiss
2701;Went there tonight 7pm not that busy, hostesses brought me to my seat, sat there for 10 minutes waitress focused on table next to me visited them 3 times. I got up a left. When to Boston pizza. Never again.
2702;Don't ever go there on New Years Day. Slow service, short staffing, mixed up orders, cold food and a cold restaurant are all great ways to loose business. Add a drunk who takes a swing at a server and the manager doesn't do anything and well you get the picture. Not a good place to eat at all.
2703;One of the worst Swiss Chalet out there. This location keeps going down hill on my every visit. No one cares about the quality of the food or guest. Tables are always sticky, dirty, dark burnt oil tasting fries and Dark meat soo dry like its been sitting in some warmer for hours, cant even chew it. I'm surprised this location is still open. Don't waste your hard earned money here.
2704;When entering this place, it smelt like the whole place was mopped with dirty old water. The seats and table tops were dirty and the whole place gave out a old stingy vibe. The ice cubes in our drinks gave off a taste as if their  machine filter was never changed. No staff to welcome us at the door, they were impolite all throughout our stay.The food was absolutly discusting, it was so bad( cold, too moist, and had a bad smell to it) that we didn't finish our meal.
2705;I have been coming to Swiss Chalet  sense 1967 and this was the worst.No one to great us at the door a waitress holding dirty dishes came up to us and said someone will be here shortly. Server took are order and food came out first was a ceaser salad plate was dirty (see pic) second was greasy spring rolls (see pic) then chicken with burnt nasty fries also see pic.What ever happened to free refills  on are pop .I thought when my meal  done the server was going to left my plate but instead she put some papers on my empty plate and walked away.  There was a lot of yelling from staff how they had no change.We paid by debt card and left.It was a Thursday night 7.30 and it was slow.What ever happened to Swiss Chalet?
2706;Ordered delivery, came the first time but was missing condiments, the sour cream for my baked potato and utensils. Called them, the manager said they will resend, but after 1 hr of waiting, it still did not appear. Called them 3 times, but they were closed so no one picked up my calls hence I called customer centre. The girl was prompt to connect me to the store and the manager said that apparently they did but "someone's husband answered the door declining the sour cream"..... I HAVE NO HUSBAND!! As a result, because they were closed at the time, they can't send me my sour cream so they will resend my entire order to me the next day, I even made sure to ask that they will get everything perfect right? And the manager said of course. The next day (which is today), they did as they promised, BUT AGAIN NO SOUR CREAM OR UTENSILS OR CONDIMENTS. By now, I'm really upset that this happened twice. I call the restaurant again (this was around 8pm today) and the manager again promised to send my sour cream out for me.
2707;This place is suppose to be a master at chicken products. But I was very disappointed when I was served frozen (yes, hot on the outside. Still frozen inside) chicken fingers. This is not acceptable for an establishment that has been here for that many years. They have completely lost my business.
2708;Can I give it less than one star? Restaurant screws up every time we have ordered. Don't waste your time here, go somewhere else.
2709;This restaurant was DISGUSTING.  I ordered a large chicken, 4 fries and 2 gravies. The fries were stale, old and disgusting. The chicken was RAW. Honestly, we have pictures of how pink the meat was. The food tasted disgusting. I will NEVER come back here, and as soon as I can figure out how to post pictures of that raw meat in the chicken, I will. Do not go here, at all!
2710;Ordered the red snapper. The fish was rotten. Owner threw me out after I asked for my money back.
2711;This place's food is horrible. I definitely would not recommend it. The food isn't cooked properly and tastes poor in quality.
2712;I am sooo mad I went to this place!! the food is not good at all!! the curry was extremely watery like if it was a soup and taste really bad. My wife ordered the chicken stew and it was disgusting.... I went back straight up and told the owner that for $30 dollars this was real bad Caribbean food. He didn't offer any help and kick me out of the store by saying that his policy was not refound!! but it get worse!!! I left the food on the counter but as soon as I got back to the car my wife asked me to go back and throw the food on the garbage, I went back inside and what I saw I couldn't believe!!! this dirty A-Hole was putting the chicken back in the tray!!! this is horrible!!!
2713;Would rate this restaurant 0 stars if I could... Service was very mediocre. Almost seemed like the guys working there didn't want to be there... Food was also very bland. I'm normally not picky when it comes to food, but it just seemed like everything we ordered didn't have enough spices or wasn't really fresh. Will not return...
2714;I had high hopes for this place I wanted to order a naked burrito bowl according to their website when u order online it means no taco shell bowl. They tried to serve it to me with the bowl I told them I didn't want it. So what they did was just dump the salad into a takeout tray without the effort of remaking it. When I got it I did not think they put anything but salad in there. The taste didn't impress me either. For a 1st time customer I could not believe the lazy customer service they had. I will not come again. And that is saying a lot.  I usually give a place 3 chances.  One to think of it they didn't even provide cutlary for take out. .. disgusting service if I could vote zero I would
2715;my family and i were walking around chinatown and we randomly decided to stop in here. we should have done our research better. the food was not good, the service was inattentive, and the wireless didn't even work.we had the hot and sour soup, salted squid, spicy lamb stir fry, pea sprouts and mushrooms, and lemon duck.the soup was incredibly bland, the sauce of the pea sprouts was kind of gelatinous. the lamb was decent, and the salted squid was really good, it was crispy and seasoned perfectly.the biggest disappointment was the lemon duck, though i think it was probably my fault because it's a risky thing to order. but learn from my mistake and don't get it! the duck is battered and deep fried. the batter is really sweet and tastes like cake batter, and it settled in the crevices of the duck and was dense and not at all like it was even fried. the sauce that came with it was a super sweet, little bit sour gelatinous sauce that nobody touched. it was such an intense way to ruin duck and made me really 
2716;Kensey W has it nailed. Meagh! Tasteless food the way Chinese used to be in the 70s in Toronto. Tasteaway discount or not this has fallen of my radar never to be restored again. I guess P T Barnum was right about a sucker being born every minute and yesterday was my starring in this role.
2717;First off if you are in Chinatown this should be the last place you should eat Chinese food! However I used just eat one night and was very disappointed. I ordered chicken corn soup which was probably the best thing of the 3 I ordered but then again how can you mess that up? A med soup was 7 bucks. I ordered shanghai noodles and this is the worst shanghai noodles in the world. No joke even frozen dinners are better!! The noodles were not fresh and extremely soggy. As I write this review the memory  of the taste is making me feel disgusted with. Also what kind of shanghai noodle is sweet? On the menu its labelled as spicy with a chili icon but instead it was rather SWEET. Sweet and soggy shanghai noodles are the worst. Next thing I ordered was pork dumplings which came steamed. $8 the price seemed ok I believe it came with either 10 or 12 but this was a tasteless dumpling which I was unable to finish. This place is a disgrace to Chinatown eateries. Please save your money and eat something decent as there a
2718;Ordered online for a few order of dumplings for the office, took 1.5 hour to get there.  People I ordered the food for already when home.  When the guy finally got there and I was like whats up with the long delivery time he said he called me.  I look at my phone it said i had a miss call one minute ago.  He put the food on the table and walked out complimenting our computer monitors and our desks, talking about everything but the food.  I knew I should have stayed away the second I saw chicken balls on the menu.
2719;Didn't recieve half of my delivery order but paid for it. Was told it's not their fault and oh well. Woman screaming at me. Opened my veggtables and found an earwig or cockroach sitting right on top. NEVER EVER AGAIN. That's what I get for not waiting an hour for new Ho king to open. THIS PLACE IS THE WORST. The city needs to shut them down.
2720;This place is horrible. The food wasn't edible and took 1.5 hours for delivery. Literally had to call them back 3 times! Stay away. I ordered the honey garlic ribs it wasn't edible...!!!
2721;This place should be shut down. I used to order delivery from here and it was my go to place for Chinese food. In my last order there was a giant cockroach in my food. I was completely disgusted. I called the restaurant about it and had some woman screaming at me that it couldn't be proven where the cockroach came from. DO NOT order from here. They need to be inspected.
2722;I usually do not give one start. But I wanna give this place 0 star... I ordered fried rice with shrimps. All the shrimps turned sour. I strongly do not recommend this place. The food quality really needs to be inspected.
2723;My boyfriend and I decided to go to an NXNE comedy show at this "bistro". Despite the establishment's effort to be a yuppie and hip east end hot spot, it misses its mark completely. Pitfalls- No proper drink menu- No draft beers- Serves only overpriced bottled beersThat's just to name a few...I ended up only ordering a $5 can of PBR and the boyfriend ordered a bottle of Guinness and the daily soup. Everything here is mediocre from the menu and lack of offerings to the lacklustre atmosphere and total disorganization amongst the staff. What a train wreck of a place.
2724;I love how close this place is to my condo as I live in one park place down the road. I've been here for about 1.5 years and really wanted to give this place a shot. I liked the kale salads and the chicken breast to go if I'm in a pinch. However I ordered a meat ball with a soup and the meat was so undercooked I felt sick when I cut it open. Instantly in the trash and goodbye paintbox. After a few times I will not be back, not even for a coffee. The staff are so rude... I have no idea why but every time I'm there I get horrible attitude. I am so NOT the person to say this as I love new local shops and businesses but I wish this was a Starbucks.
2725;Terrible - How would you like to bite into your sandwich and have HAIR in it??  Disgusting.
2726;The food was ok the service was horrible.  The waitress took our drink orders and never returned with them until we went to look for her.  She said she thought the food runner was bringing them and said sorry it was because there was a large private party however she was not serving the private party but talking to her boyfriend and various friends who came to visit her.  This is really unfortunate the food was ok and it's the only place to eat in this area.  Whoever owns it should smarten up and focus on service. A place like this will not last with horrible service like that.  I'd rather walk 10 blocks than eat here again.
2727;I am disappointed every time I come here!For example, I came in now to find them closed despite the sign on their front door saying that they're open until 6pm. There have been innumerable other minor complaints. I've been trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I'm disappointed every time I come here!!!
2728;What this place wants to be and what it is are a long ways apart.  It is a fairly nice space.  Superb artists come here to perform, likely drawn by the "socially responsible" setup as a training and employment place for Regent Park locals and George Brown students.But suffering through the dismal food, beverage, and service offerings to hear great music ruins what could be a great evening.  Reserving early and paying in advance won't even guarantee you can get a table where you can hear the music, let alone see the stage.  Ignoring customers is an often used problem-solving strategy.  I have a theory that the developer of the new Regent Park is filling a lot of the seats, because there seem to be exclusive reserved tables that are not available to the public, even when you have been told you bought the first tickets.  Those tables get preferential treatment from staff.The kitchen puts out a limited menu of fairly ordinary food.  Nothing really wrong with the food, but if it wasn't for the music, I wouldn't 
2729;My daughter & I were next door attending Unplugged Expo 2 convention in Oct. 2013 & con organizers had thoughtfully CLOSED any on site food facilities all weekend. Starving by lunchtime, we had no choice but to dash in the miserable rain to the pretentiously named "Paint Box" "Bistro." We were somewhat underwhelmed by its poor selection deli menu with a display of tiny packaged unappetizing "healthy" snacks and little bottles of obscure juices and waters. A sign announced a "Special Menu" for the con, which turned out to mean a LIMITED menu of just 2 choices. You should be honoured they bothered to serve con goers even that much, was the implication. Trapped and hungry, we chose the overpriced, bland and skimpy sandwiches, which fell apart all over the plate, and which included bitter unseasoned veggie sides. It was all about stylized cutesy presentation but nothing about making sure the food was actually flavourful it was just barely mediocre.Social experiment, my ass. This pathetic hipster cafe, fraudu
2730;Love the idea behind the Paintbox Bistro but the food and service is terrible. We ordered fish and chips and the "chips" came with our dessert. The website said the steak was halal but when we asked the server to confirm, they said it was in fact not halal. I really want to like this place but get disappointed every time we come.
2731;We live in the Paintbox Condo above the restaurant and when we first moved in came a few times and found the service ok but really slow and the limited menu was over priced so we stopped going.I decided to drop by for lunch today. There were 3 groups of people at tables eating and 2 servers ... When I walked in no one acknowledged me.. One of the servers got more water for one table .. Then the other server cleared some plates and they still didn't acknowledge me.. The servers went behind the counter and chatted with each other while I stood there.. I grabbed menu and sat down.  Still nothing. The servers brought a coffee to one table and the bill to another then went back to chatting with each other...I walked in at 12:05 and at 12:18 I walked out and went around the corner to Suko Thai were I was served immediately
2732;I am a student and do my coop in the same building as this place. I come here on average once a week, and sometimes I just buy a cookie or something. I've liked  the taste of the food and the design of the place, but the service is always weird. This place makes the whole comunity look way better but the staff seem sassy and hate their job. Today I got the curry wrap to go and after I ate it I saw my boss heading to throw away some grilled veggies I was going to get from the restaurant. She said it tasted funny and the food doesn't look and smell right. Then she brought up how she had the breakfast sandwhich and it looked terible inside it, the eggs wen't cooked properly and the bacon was half cooked. Another co worker then said that she had the steak wrap the other day and it didn't agree with her at all. I thought to myself, "always eat here and I dought I will have the same problem". I got home... And had a date with my toilet. Never coming here agian!Edit: Also this place is way pricy compared to the com
2733;I went here this past Saturday for brunch, we were immediately seated and the wait staff was polite, both my guest and myself ordered the omelette of the day which was a very basic omelette with a sliver of brie cheese and a few pieces of red and green peppers, the side dishes were a very basic salad with a drizzle of vinaigrette dressing and literally half of a pan fried potato. Overall every single dish was very bland - I had asked the wait staff for additional salad dressing but they forgot to bring it, I had also asked for a side of ketchup and it literally took 15 minutes to get this, by the time I received it my dish was luke warm at best. Lastly all of this was served on a cutting board for the plate...ok I get they are trying a chic model look but a cutting board is just not functional eat off, the melted brie cheese spilled out of the omelette and on to the table, and all this for $13.00 each - there are far superior breakfast restaurants in the area, namely Frans.Needless to say I do appreciate wh
2734;Oh, how I wanted to like this place.  I really did.  Such an admirable philosophy behind the place.  And a fun decor and design.  My partner and I were here for brunch this past weekend, and it was just a comedy of errors.  We had to wait for over five minutes at the door in a half-empty restaurant for anyone to take note of us.  And then we had to wait at the table for ten minutes for a waiter to come over.  Although the service was polite and friendly, it was very amateurish, often disappearing for long periods of time.  Water glasses went unfilled.  The same goes for the food, which took over twenty minutes to arrive, and when it did, it arrived all at once.  Our starters were a microscopic salad and miniscule portion of soup, both of which we received literally a minute before our main course, which was a very unremarkable frittata.  No sides or anything -- not even a slice of toast or a potato to be found.  It wasn't bad, but just very bland, and skimpy.All of this set us back almost 40 dollars (be
2735;This is an attractive place with a social purpose and the worst service I have ever seen--disinterested, sometimes surly. Place was almost empty too. Salad was good, however. I will not return.
2736;First time trying this place and will NOT be going back. Got the Jamaican patties they were dry and lacked flavour. Customer service wasn't good no one came to help us.... until they noticed I had my dog. I had intended to order more but was told to leave because of my dog which brings me to my second issue. Least dog friendly bistro in Toronto. Couldn't keep my well trained dog tied outside for a few minutes while getting takeout as there are signs all over saying no dogs on the grass which was the only area available to tie a dog. In conclusion wouldn't recommend and won't be going back.
2737;Got Thursday chicken special. what are they serving? look like crap. we are done going here. There is still nandos and popeyes
2738;I used to be a regular customer and have been ordering from this place since the beginning as it newly opened. The quality has become horrible. The food used to be delicious with great quality and quantity, however it's not the same anymore. The chicken salad is possibly the worst dish they have as it lacks efficient quality and quantity. The poutine lacks right amount of gravy and cheese. The service is horrible (Women at the counter very rude and unorganized). I have also sensed uncleanness, the health inspection should be done frequently. I know tons of other boaster chicken restaurants which offer a variety, not just fried chicken. Did I mention how oily the broasted chicken is? Made me sick. I advise everyone not to eat from here. Terrible experience. The wait is literally over 20 minutes. So disorganized.
2739;I give this 1 star. It's service is horrible, you have to wait around 20 minutes until they get you your order. Also, the shwarma's aren't even shwarma's because it had NO hummus and it was made out of a tortilla wrap. And the shwarma's have SOGGY fries.  Shwarma's should not have fries. The chicken wings were Sooooo dry. The food and service is poor. They should just call the shwarma's  a snack wrap. I might as well just buy a  Mc Donald's snack wrap that is cheaper. It's not good at all ( my opinion ). I recommend Cyrus in Oshawa, Canada, ON
2740;I believe new management has taken over. Increased prices, decreased quality. Ordered chicken breast burgers served in poor quality buns, old lettuce with a small, thin piece of chicken breast. Spicy burger was a regular burger lathered in hot sauce. I would recommend spending your hard earned money elsewhere.
2741;Surprised they have lasted this long.  Save your money and stay away.  So much variety in Markham
2742;Got sick from the raw chicken they served me. The service wasn't that great either.
2743;Yeah, I cant even properly review this place because we were actually just shunned. My mom and I were at the counter waiting to order, and the man at the counter basically tottered around ignoring us. Then, when a family came in behind us, he proceeded to look right past us and serve them. We looked at each other and confused, watched as he immediately rang throigh and processed their order while continuing to kot acknowledge us standing at th counter. I am blown away and confused. My mom and I were completely ignored and didnt even get the opportunity to try the food. Great customer service....
2744;I just want to start off saying that the overall experience was nice. Having said that make sure to ask the prices before selecting the hookah. Before going, I read the reviews on Yelp and others have said it was $13 for a hookah. After sitting there for about an hour we went to pay our bill. The gentleman working said it was $44.95!!!! I inquired about the high charge and he originally said it is unlimited hookahs on Friday and Saturday nights....I then reminded him it was a Sunday night and he quickly changed his story and said unlimited hookahs on Friday, Saturday, and Sundays. I asked him where it shows the prices for the hookah and he said with a smile "it's just how it is"....that's interesting! That's how it is?! I wish I can use that same verbiage in my job!I am not saying don't go to this place but just beware that the prices might be a lot higher then you expect.Hope this helps!
2745;The owner hasn't mentioned about price until we pay. When we ask for the bill, 2 drinks and one shisha costed $90. FYI, this is a place you should keep away.
2746;They do not answer their phone and there isn't a way to know if they are open or not. I've moved on to the next hookah lounge on the list.
2747;First off, I'm from a middle eastern background, so I grew up with this kind of food. We went to this place,when we came to Toronto to visit, because it was so close to our hotel (the Metropolitan,go figure)....me,(the Canadian) + 3 Italian visitors. I raved about middle eastern food to them. Then we went in to this place. What a mistake! We walked in, and I immediately saw the unappealing and ancient pizza slices that were sitting under glass, looking like they had been sitting there for days. Same goes for a half dozen samosas sitting on their counter.(Samosas? "Lebanese" cuisine?) The rice was not "Lebanese" but more "Indian"....there was clearly curry added to it,plus it was dry and chewy,easy to tell it had been sitting under those lamps pretty much all day. The tabouleh consisted of chopped parsley, and diced tomatoes....thats it!....no olive oil, no lemon, no onions and no garlic. The hummous was runny and bland.....barely any tahini, no lemon, no garlic...blah! It was so runny, that it just soaked t
2748;The owner is a very dishonest man. One shisha, a cup of coffee and tea, and a bottle of barbican cost us about $38! Just stay away! I frequently walk by this place and 9/10 times there are no customers while this place is still running, HAH!
2749;They use a crapload of spice to cover up the disgusting taste of everything. Ramen was below average, make your own bowl had so much salt in the sauce, and the pork seemed like it came from a prepackaged meal.
2750;When my food first arrived, I thought, oh the portion size is pretty small. I was hungry and expected something bigger for $10 worth of food. After I took a bite, I was glad it was small because there was no way I could finish something that tasted so horrible. How do you even make food taste so bad and rancid? What did you do to it? Do not come here. The hot dog stand on the street is a way better choice.
2751;Definitely NOT authentic!went there for lunch, ordered a ramen and it's not authentic:- by looking at the photos on the menu, I expected to get a soft boiled egg, seaweed, instead, I got a hard boiled egg, and it's not even marinated- no seaweed, instead I got some chopped carrot and broccoli (like chop suey)
2752;Small portion sizes, Over-priced and bland food..About to order food and they say the credit card machine is not working... Very dissapointing.. Will never go back again. Probably among the worst food I bought for $10 + tips..
2753;Ordered a ramen where the soup was salty and noodles were undercooked and stuck together. It took a long long time for the food to come out. All the portions seemed irregular. Some dishes had large portions and some dishes had really small portions eventuough they were around the same price. I ended up ordering dumplings but they tasted pretty nasty...Pretty disappointing....Food trucks have better tasting food than here...
2754;Yorkville was just up the block, but my hands were full after buying this exercise equipment, and along with my man purse..that was too far of the walk. I struggled to get between the narrow doorway with my things, as the waitress inside just stood there and watched me squeeze into her restaurant. This was not going to go well.I sat by the window, the place wasn't as nonchalant as it appears from the outside, but it's not the Ritz. The staff here was nice, and that's as good as it gets. They have this thing where they give you a bowl where you can put a bunch of stuff from their food bar, and they'll cook it up for you along with your noodle. This would have been a excellent option, if your appetite was that of a gerbil. The size of the bowl immediately demands an apology from the staff. That's what I thought anyway watching other people receive theirs, I instead ordered off of the surprisingly Canadian menu. Everything else is very...whitewashed. I was surprised they didn't have chicken balls. But don't wo
2755;The quality of food in this restaurant is way below average standard. I ordered Shoyu Ramen and the ramen turned out to be very soggy. Also, the soup base was very bland. Based on my experience with other ramen restaurants, I can tell the ramen served here is not authentic at all. I also ordered gyoza for appetizers. The gyoza was okay but still a little bit pricey.As for other intangibles, the restaurant wasn't busy yet still took them 10 minutes to serve the food. Overall, this is a very disappointing restaurant.
2756;It's sometimes unfair to judge a restaurant based on its takeout, but I don't think that even eating in house could have saved my experience. The interior of the restaurant is nicer than the outside, but that is my The 'choose your own veggies' concept is not entirely unique, but the first time I've seen it done in the area. I was a little puzzled by the set up, but tI suppose the method prevents the "ew, what is this?" factor often experienced by some eaters when trying new asian foods.My order for the night included  'make your own bowl' with the sesame ginger sauce, tom yum gong, and lychees on ice.Perhaps I was hungry today, but I noted that my 'bowl' was a surprisingly small portion, and had a mere four shrimps. (I'm pretty sure I get more everything, not just shrimp, from Spring Rolls just down the street). The sauce was quite flavourful, but not with the sesame or ginger flavours it was apparently supposed to have. As for the vegetables, I obviously cannot say anything about what was placed in it
2757;I normally don't write reviews but I just had to say this was the absolute worst food I've ever had, possibly in my entire life. The only reason I ended up there was because I was starving, craving ramen, and it was the first spot I saw so I decided to try it out. Service was unbelievably slow and inattentive even though it wasn't very busy. I ordered the spicy ramen. The noodles were undercooked and still stuck together. The boiled egg was overcooked and probably old. There was maybe 2 mini pieces of meat. The broth was bland, not even spicy. I should've just went home and made a better bowl of instant noodles.
2758;This is my first review and the exact reason why I joined Yelp - never again shall I walk in a random restaurant without checking its reviews online! Do the homework even if I'm too hungry to think!!
2759;Got their pad thai. Unfortunately 80% of the dish tasted like carrots and excess oil. Disappointing
2760;It's a nice looking place and the food is alright tasting.  But that's about all that is good.  Sure it's a build your own meal kind of thing but definitely the worst I've experienced.  For $10 they give you a small bowl (think miso soup at a sushi place) which you have to pack full of veggies.  They add the noodles and meat after.Really what's the point of this?  Sure maybe I want more broccoli than sprouts but with such little options and bowl size they might as well just whip me up a stir-fry of their own and save me the effort of getting up from the table.  Any place I've gone to before (i.e. the fantastic Open Sesame in Calgary) has a huge bowl and huge buffet to match where you can choose not only veggies but noodles and sauces as well.You're definitely not getting your value here for the small portion sizes.  Skip this one.
2761;I can not believe people actually go to this restaurant and spend so much money.  I went with my son and daughter and paid $99 for 3 of us and the food was beyond disgusting.  It was cold and tasteless.  My daughter had a bowl of mashed potatoes - shocking how expensive it was and what horrible food.  Never would I return or suggest anyone eat there.
2762;The broken heart rating is certainly fitting as this place has sadly fallen far from glory. All the food is so over cooked (or reheated) that it's dried out to the point of disgust. I mean really, when would I EVER pass on lobster?!?! It was dry and tasteless. Ruining lobster is a sin!The pastas are mushy. The meats dry and bland. The only thing not OVERcooked was the tripe which needed to simmer for another couple of hours when done right. The service was pleasant and good but the weekend prices are just unjustifiable given the dramatically decreasing quality of the food. This used to be a family favorite. No longer I'm afraid. We simple can not return.
2763;Worst buffet that I've ever been to! They charge so much for a very small selection of italian food ($27 weekend dinner) which btw i think, is not authentic at all. Most dishes were very salty. Risotto, lasagna, parmigiana, calamari, you name it. And then they have 2 kinds of soup and both were tomato based which was salty too. Desserts are hmm just ok. Cant really say much about the service. Anyways, I have not enjoyed even a single food here. Its that bad. Absolutely my first and last! Please save yourself some money and get some happy meal from Mcdonalds. I know I should have. Sorry!
2764;I am a frequent customer of Vinnie Zucchini. I have even recommended this restaurant to friends and family in the past. But yesterday when I went to visit with my wife, I was served some very bad chicken. I even noticed that afterwards, the owner (or whoever was in charge) realized there was something wrong and went to try it and then spoke to the chef. It seemed that they had realized the chicken had gone bad or something, and tried to cover it up by placing peppers on top. We did not say anything to the waitress, as she was very nice and we did not want to upset her or make a big deal out of it at the time. I will no longer be visiting this establishment, and will no longer recommend it to anyone. I really enjoyed going to this restaurant, but I am very disappointed and will not be going back.
2765;Worst experience! We went in on April 4th 2015 with our extended family, four adults and two kids. Had a bad experience at the entrance itself. They said, there is a wait of half hour, and we were still thinking what to do, and the lady asked us "So, do you want to leave?" this is the exact sentence she asked. We are shocked to hear that, and no one would even bother to wait i guess. We were highly humiliated by the way we were treated, and lost respect.
2766;So they closed the location years ago around Dufferin and Steeles and this is what they came up with...just pathetic.  I remember going 7-8 years ago (close to home) and the place was packed, with good food, different salads and great dessert.  Not sure what happened, food cost? New owners? but this was a joke.The salad selection is sad, not to mention not even 1 pasta salad really? What happened to all the different dressings? Cesar is all you can come up with?  No one ate the pasta but one kind, when it was over is wasn't refilled.  Some of the dishes are bland, or most of the dishes have the same marinara sauce which makes things just boring.  Desserts....ah what dessert, ice cream, some brownies and cookies game over!  The atmosphere in the place is like the food, boring!If you want an all you can eat go Asian or better yet go to another Italian restaurant, avoid this place.  For an all you can eat Mandarin got more choices and even though I hardly go there I would recommend it.  They are hurting real
2767;To compare Vinnie Zucchini to Frankie Tomatos is waaay off!I have been to Frankie's many times and although it is nothing more than a "canadian" take on italian it has killer calamari.I went once to Vinnie Zucchini and I will NEVER go back. Anyone can say whatever they want about the decor..I go to restaurants for their food. This place is NOT italian whatsoever...the people working there are not italian...if u catch my drift. Pasta was overcooked, there was too much cilantro in food..and I hate cilantro..so the salads were no good for me..and then whatever i did eat..i threw-up for the next day and a half when I got home...I got food poisoning!!!so do yourself a favor...if u love REAL italian food..don't waste your time!
2768;Food is nothing great really. To be honest, I don't think some of the food is really that fresh. It's also overpriced for what it is.
2769;For all the years my family have been to here, this has to be the most disappointing time. I remember when they used to be at dufferin and steeles. The food was phenomenal, the value and the quality and selection was superb. Over the years, we've noticed changes the the selection of the food and is really disappointed in how it has become. Service is still great but the food has definitely gone downhill. So sad.
2770;I really don't get the appeal of this place, it's not cheap and the food is horrible. I went to the buffet, grabbed a few things I felt were safe bets to eat. Things that would be hard to mess up. I was so disappointed, I couldn't even finish the small serving of food I had gotten because it was so dry, and bland. I will definitely not be coming back here, I wouldn't have come a second time of my wife hadn't twisted my arm having remembered the poor experience from my first visit.
2771;I have not been here for a while.  One section of the restaurant is close, only the outer section is open.  The waiter is very nice and always smile.Go around the table and there isn't too much food around.  The pizza counter has 4 kinds of pizza.  The toppings are sparsely distributed.  The taste is not outstanding.  Most of the dishes I look at them do not entice my appetite.  Either there is only a thin layer left or dices of meat, vegetables or fish at the corners.  It is Sunday at 7pm for a buffet dinner.  Come on, at least has to fill up all the plates.  It looks as if they are near closing time.  For the chef counter offers the roast pork.  The chef is so busy cleaning up his utensil and behind the counter kitchen.  He saw me but not seem willing to serve.  I have to ask him for the roast pork.  After he cut and hand me the pieces, he just throw the fork and tongs on the cutting board echoing a big metallic sound.  OMG!  How can he serve the customers like that.Same for the dessert table.  Every ca
2772;I'm huge fan of the rich Italian cuisine but didn't get that experience at this place
2773;Not being a huge fan of buffets, my boyfriend and I decided to check this place out after looking up their menu online and being impressed by the sheer volume of dishes offered. Upon arriving at the place, we waited 10 minutes to be seated even though the place only had a few other patrons and tons of empty tables. When we were finally seated, an employee (owner?) was engaged in a very heated conversation about money with some executives directly behind us, which kind of made for an uncomfortable dining experience. Now for the food: although my boyfriend is a huge pasta lover, he was unimpressed with the large selection of dishes offered, nothing standout or spectacular, but then again the food is typical buffet quality. I was surprised that there weren't more pizza options , and the ones that were offered we're kind of dry and the ingredients weren't exactly the freshest. The worst thing about Vinnie's however was not the bland uninteresting food or unprofessional service, but the fact that both me and my bo
2774;Went to Vinnies as a friends recommendation and the food was disgusting. The pasta was overcooked or cold. The pizza taste worst then (pizza pizza midnight slices). The deep fried calamari had so much breading on it and taste plain. The mini burgers taste burned. Overall go to Vinnies if you want food poison and have a large among of Msg.
2775;The problem here is the cooks don't know how to cook Italian and they don't seem to care that much about food,  they're cheap line cooks with no experience , most food items were cold or hard, my stomach felt unhappy after the the second plate of food, we barely ate anything and ended up with a $80 bill between 2 people..  no wonder they closed in the past, but reopening in an Italian area won't help..
2776;I'm so upset!  I was there two months ago (after years of not going due to food going downhill) and was really impressed.Well either they changed owners since then or they're back to their old ways, I hated it tonight!I had a group of 13 to celebrate a birthday since I was impressed the last time, and what an embarrassment to my friends and family who came from all over to celebrate at this poor excuse for Italian.  As well, the food was cold, the service was horrible (never asked if needed more drinks, took food away when you weren't paying attention, definitely not worth a tip!Save yourself the trip, this restaurant is a joke run by Asians and Indians is no Italian restaurant!
2777;To give this restaurant a 1star is being extremely generous. The service was terrible before I even got seated. I had made reservations early in the morning. Once I arrived, i did not get a friendly greeting. Not only did I still have to wait for a table, but they had sat us right next to the door which is completely empty and dead. I asked the waitress if there was anything inside the dining room area instead where the atmosphere was better. She turned to me and said, no, there isn't any. I asked what the waiting time was for a better table but she said she has no idea. Then I asked if she can check, she walked a few steps to peak into the dining room came back and said, no, nothing will be available for the next while. She didn't even try! I was willing to wait if she was more cooperative. I asked her again, what is the waiting time if I was willing to wait. She told me to go look at the dining room myself. WOW. I can't believe that was her response!! My boyfriend then asked to speak with the manager. The m
2778;Don't ever order from here. If I could give this place a -1 I would. This particular Pizza Nova is absolutely horrible. They never cook the pizza thoroughly. As I noticed this I began to think, maybe I should specify well done. I still received an undercooked almost raw pizza. So I figured let's say extra well done.... I still got a raw pizza!! Every time I have to re-cook the pizza in my own oven when it gets to my house. The pizza makes you feel gross and sick every time. This pizza Nova is just horrible, the workers don't care about what they send out, and they clearly don't read the delivery notices. I highly suggest ordering from somewhere else and going to pick it up if this is your delivery district. The worst pizza Nova around. They either need new ownership or need to be closed.
2779;Service was bad enough that I asked for a refund and left without getting pizza. The employee didn't seem to care, was not clear about price, and shortchanged me when refunding me. Go to Pizza Pizza across the street for better service and much better value.
2780;This McDonald's is the slowest one I have EVER been to. No matter what time of day or what my order is, I always have to wait forever for my food. They also screw up my orders more often than not. What gives?!?!
2781;if you order a coffee it comes with 30min taken away from your life... other than the wait for your FAST FOOD its okay
2782;The last time I went here, I waited over 20 minutes for two McMuffins. At 5:45am. Alone in the drive-thru.No apology, no 'it's on us', no nothing.Never again.
2783;If there was an option for no stars this location would get it.  The service is horrid, my order has never been right.  I've actually stopped going to this location even though it is a couple blocks from my house.  I would not recommend it unless you have time to burn.  20 minutes for two meals at 8 pm both of which were wrong ( paid for a double big mac .. get a single. ect)  they don't respond well to criticism.  And when told that they need to go over their staff the Manager does not like it.  I've been in management for a long time and I personally wouldn't hire or have kept half the staff.  Also the place is in dire need of an update and proper cleaning.. Never again
2784;Pretty much the dirtest, greasiest mcdonalds out there. Stay away from the breakfast sandwitches to got sick for 3 days...
2785;Can't remember a time when they got an order right and I didn't have to wait over 20 minutes for it
2786;Jan 15th, 16Order my pizza extra well done and it came under cooked.  The service is great, and they rushed out another one but still not cooked properly.  Although I give an A for Effort the  it is spelled with and "E" and that is what the pizza was.  Only had 2 slices!!! Extremely disappointed.  This was my second time ordering from Gino's the 1st was from store #41 in Niagara.  And, although I was very pleased with the quality of the pizza as well as the service I couldn't score it a 5. Maybe store #41 is just that much better than the others...again, very pleased overall.
2787;Came here for their promotional cheese/ pepperoni slices.  Never have them ready and gives you that.. tough shit attitude.  The manager (blue shirt) is very condescending and stuck up.  He needs to get his head out of his ass and live in reality. The other staff are just as rude as they all give the customer upsells.  Stay away and save your frustration by going somewhere else
2788;Manager is disgusting. Had plastic cooked into a cheese pizza. We called pizza pizza and they gave us a 25$ credit. When I tried to go back the manager harassed me and suggested next time I have plastic in my pizza I should come to him and he will give me $1000. Can't go back without being harassed.
2789;Ordered a POUTINE the other night (the good, the bad, and the ugly) and I seriously got a microwaved order of bacon cheese fries, with pickles, and gravy thrown on top. Seriously. SERIOUSLY. I ordered a full size POUTINE, too, and it was in a half size box but whatever. The stryofoam box was obviously was microwaved, the fries were becoming apart of the box, and the bottom was all warped. (Don't try to tell me it was from putting the fries into the box-- I've worked in a kitchen before), it obviously tasted like crap, and I threw it out.. I didn't feel like ingesting Styrofoam was a good idea anyway. I also had an order of catch me if you can wings, which were ....Very not right. Catch me if you can is maple, and extra hot... What I got wasnt spicy at all. Very tragic. My sister works at another ww location, and couldn't believe what sort of food I was given. Sorry WW closest to my house, you will never have another nickel from me. I would never recommend this location. The staff may be friendly, but, th
2790;Limited choice of dishes and all of which taste similar if not exactly the same. Salty and spicy in a unpleasant way. With all these said it's also got a greasy floor and fume-y air. And charge premium price for their dish.Didn't know why we stayed, but hey the person whos reading this and considering this place. run.
2791;This restaurant if i could give it 0. I would give it 0 stars. As it is by far one of the worst restaurants in toronto ive ever tried. It fails on multiple fronts. Lets start with the most basic which is food. Which is the most important thing in a restaurant. The food is just not good period. The stinky tofu is tasteless and bland. The sweet and sour pork tenderloin is soggy and overcooked. To the point of it is probably unacceptable in most even cheap food court restaurants. And the chicken that is stir fried in claypot is oversalted to the extreme. With the tofu and pig blood part being oversalted as well. As if to cover that the chicken is not fresh at all.     The 2nd thing this restaurant fails at is price and portion. It charges a very expensive price for the portion. Now usually this means perhaps the food has quality but since its established it doesnt the value is none. The portion is tiny beyond tiny.  The 3rd part is the service. We went on a sunday at 2pm. When they were not busy and only had
2792;I would put less than one star if I could.  The waitress is day dreaming..staring into space. Nothing to do.  No napkins until asked and they were so confused.  Spoke in 3 different languages until they understood.  English, Cantonese and then mandarin.  Slow service.  They somehow managed to make the fried fish soggy.  Stir fried dishes were not stir fried together. It's toss some meat in, add handful of veggies on top and stirred.  Not actually cooked together. My fried noodles with veggies & meat had no meat...I did manage to scrounge up a small sliver from the soy sauce noodles. No wonder there was only one other table of patrons.
2793;This restaurant is the most disorganized place I've ever been. The waitress who took our orders was also wearing an apron that made me believe she might be the cook, later on i saw her putting on plastic gloves to the back that made me also believe that she might also wash dishes. And yes, also a cashier. As you guessed, the service was slow. Our first dish came to us after about 20 mins of ordering, the 2nd dish came to us 20 mins after the first dish. And she forgot to bring rice. The portion was so bad compare to the price! see picture, that's less than a 8 inch bowl and cost us $13.99! I don't have any nice things to say about this restaurant.
2794;Just moved to Toronto not to long ago and decided to try this place after receiving a flyer in the mail. All I have to say is wow is place is awful. Ordered about $70 worth of food because my family and I like leftovers and we were so disappointed. Portions were super small, food was dry, over priced, not a place I would expect anyone to go. I should have went on yelp to see the reviews so I guess I learned my lesson. The person taking my order barely spoke English, I would not recommend this place at ALL
2795;Oh My God! Don't even bother...the worst food ever. Nothing Thai tasting, the noodles are just soy sauce and some vegetable. The spicy chicken, meh! The spring roll is a joke. Waste of money.
2796;I adore Thai food!I tried Thai Express in the Scotia Plaza a couple years ago ... I wasn't impressed.The St. Clair E location recently opened and I thought I'd give it a try.I ordered the yellow curry chicken.  They boil the chicken to heat it up!  Ewwww!!! They add it to some fresh peppers, onions and pineapple.  Then they mix in some heated yellow curry sauce.  Finally they dump it on top of a bed of rice.  With the pop, it was almost $11!I know it was fast food but it was nasty!  There are some good Thai fast food restaurants that blow this one away.  I don't understand the line-ups I see for this chain at other locations ... there are much better places to spend your $$.Never ever ever again!
2797;my first 1 star rating. I love thai food. I love when the take out is packed in cute chinese take out boxes. I love when the food is made fast so I can save time.so I run in here to get some quick lunch before my class.they had two veg options for almost everything: 1.Vegetables 2. TofuSo I choose stir fry. that's the dialog that happens:me: I'll have vegetarian stir fry with tofugirl at the counter: vegetable stir fry (and starts typing it in and shouts the order in I suppose mandarin to the cook)me: it's the tofu version right?girl at the counter: tofu?me: yes. it has tofu right?girl at the counter: yes yes it has tofu (no smiles offered at any time)I wait for 2min and get my order and run to the streetcar stop. I get onto the streetcar and start eating.for $8 I got mini mini portion of food. but it gets worse.40% of my meal was onion. 55% - rice and the rest 5% mix of 2 slices of broccoli and 4 slices of carrot.... where was the tofu I don't know but I guess it stayed at the kitchen.res
2798;Even though they apparently make the food fresh in front of you, it is still a bland brown mush.  Sitting here a couple of days later, I can't even remember what I had. I remember what it looked like - monochrome.  Checking my receipt, I see that it was veggie Pad Thai.I could not identify any veg, they were cut so small.  Except onions, which were plentiful.  So, for. $8, I left still hungry, not satisfied in any way.  Except that the tea, which is free, was quite good.Staff either didn't understand English at all or spoke English but just gave any old incorrect information to answer questions about the food.  Like another reviewer here, the tofu I ordered never materialized, but I didn't care to try to communicate with them again.While eating, I watched the guy who made my food go out for a smoke (where he was visible just outside the window, yuck), and return to the restaurant without washing his hands and start to cook again.Too expensive, not good, dubious cleanliness, won't go back.
2799;It really pains me to write this review. You have been warned do not waste your money on this restaurant. It is a complete insult to Caribbean food. The decor of the restaurant is nice, the service was friendly and the food came out in a timely manner. We ordered the chicken wings plate which came the smallest quantity of chicken and barely a scoop of coleslaw/bread. How is this possible? The chicken was not jerk it was purely hot and inedible. I wouldn't serve that to my worst enemy. Also we ordered a side of plantains which were good and quantity matched the price. I was determined to not believe the previous Yelp reviews but they are accurate. This place has great potential but you have to deliver with taste and quantity.
2800;This place is truly an insult to Caribbean cuisine... Let me start with the good - located in a prime location parking is within walking distance.The bad calling themselves a Caribbean fusion restaurant. The rice and peas were undercooked and loaded with coconut milk and sugar. Please do yourself a favour and skip the macaroni pie. This disgusting concoction had no flavour and they had the audacity to add coconut milk and garnish it with shavings. This ingredient should never be added to this dish. If you like pepper shrimp then stay clear of this place. We were served with prawns that weren't properly cleaned and the sauce was disgusting. The jerk pork and chicken were under seasoned. Jerk is a blend of herbs and spices, how can you mess this up? The meat was obviously not marinated long enough. The texture of the chicken was dry and couldn't detect the seasoning in the pork. The ugly - from first glance the restaurants decor looks inviting, but please look more closely. When was the last time they moppe
2801;Recently I had lunch here. It was a horrible experience. I was drawn in by the visible cool and funky factor of the wood floors and tin on the walls. Everything went to hell after that.First of all, about 4 items of the 10 item menu were unavailable. Not to worry, the pork (12.99 for a half-pound) I wanted was available. I ordered and was told it would be 15 minutes, which seemed long for pre-done pork and slaw, yet I waited. 1. I was offered ice and a glass for my Coke, yet never got it.2. The order took 45 minutes to arrive. If you have an hour for lunch, this sucks. I noticed a few of the only- a-few customers complaining about the long wait to little avail other than being told to wait more. One poor sucker who had called in a to go order was asked (after he had been waiting at least 25 minutes) if just "wanted to eat it here."3. Loud music blared through the impressive speakers. If you like loud music where every song has the "n" word or some demeaning reference to women, or if you don't want to he
2802;Went here for dinner with my family. It was the worst meal that I had especially for the the $90 I spent. I could have made a better dinner at home. The concept of the restaurant is really nice but they have to find another cool. Awful!!! I would not go back.
2803;I'm so disappointed with this place all I'm gonna say is this.I just ordered $50 in sushi because I couldn't eat any of this food. Got it go, oxtail was the worst we've ever had, the spicy shrimp was not shrimp. It was prawns. coleslaw was so soggy tasted like it had been sitting out for two days, portions were small PLUS they forgot one of our orders. I'm pissed to say the least now that I have spent over $100 tonight on my dinner.  The worst.
2804;Funny how most reviews are either 1 star or 5. Lol. Seems all of the 5 stars reviews mention the pimento wood. Pimento wood, hardwood, pinewood, Hollywood, it doesn't matter - The food is not good.I tried this place months ago and I really wanted to like it, but it just wasn't good. I felt compelled to write this review because it seems like all the 5 star reviews are fake, with some newish reviewers leaving copious amounts of other reviews in a very short amount of time. Our pork was hard and dry, with an out of place molasses coating. Too thick. What are you trying to hide? Dry pork? A pound of molasses can't  save any poorly prepared protein. It came without coleslaw. When we were half finished our half pound of jerk pork (which we weren't going to finish, not because we were full - we just couldn't continue),  the chef came out with a small side if coleslaw and said that they didn't have any when they sent out our plate which was supposed to have coleslaw in the first place.We also had a patty,  mac
2805;Girl at the cash barely had a clue what was going on. Had to ask for drinks multiple times. Oxtail was pretty shit. Mostly beans. Had like 4 tinys pieces of meat. And i paid for the 1lb order. Dont know how that happened. Jerk chicken came out bone dry. Boring flavour. Really sad for a Caribbean restaurant. Rice and peas was pretty shit too if im being honest. The mac n cheese was pretty good though, probably the only thing id go back for if i was to go back. Thats a big if.
2806;worst experience  ive had AT  a restaurant . the staff  esp the server who was no assistance as a first timer needing help with the menu , lackluster food .aweful !! Would not recommend or refer anyone else
2807;Food was 30 minutes delayed because of their broken iPad. Came for the $5 jerk chicken special but they overcharged and had to do the math for them for my correct change. Worst service ever. This was my second time here and both times the service was atrocious. Two Elite thumbs down.Pro tip: for jerk chicken, go to Rasta Pasta instead, it's 10000000% better.
2808;Terrible front of house staff - rude and indifferent. Slowest service, with pretty bad food too. Just waited about 25 mins for a take out jerk pork with slaw and bread. I got jerk pork with rice, no slaw or bread.
2809;I really really really wanted to love this place.  I really enjoy Dirty Bird and was excited that they had another restaurant opening.  I had read the Toronto star and Blog TO articles so when my partner and I were in the area last week I suggested going.  The one thing I have to admit is the decor is amazing.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere.  As others have mentioned the music is way too loud.  Several occasions I saw the staff having to run outside to take phone orders because they couldn't hear anything either.The service is extremely confusing- not only as patrons but also to the staff.  You're given a card that you complete (similar to dim sum) and you bring it up to the cash and place your order and pay.  The problem was in the follow through.  They seemed to have forgotten us as tables who placed their orders after us received their food.  They also asked us several times if we had paid and what we had ordered.  They offered us a free beer but I don't drink beer and my partner just wanted his Ting
2810;This was one of the worst dining experiences of my life. As a general rule of thumb in Toronto, if you want to avoid a bad experience, wait for a newly opened restaurant to iron out its service issues. I hope this place is new or otherwise it's just a disaster. So to back up my statement: we walk in and are instantly confused by the ordering system. The guy at the cash gives me next to no help and the typical entitled restaurant staff judgemental look when I ask him "so how does this work?", as if it was a straightforward process. To be clear, I am confused because when we try to sit down I'm being told that the seats are needed as they are reserved, as in a sit down restaurant although it's set up as a take away joint. As a side note, no one ever used those seats aside from random walk ins like us. The Bob Marley playlist ends and music stops, no one bothers to hit play again so you have this awkward vibe of extremely overlit led lighting, no music and people walking in confused with no one directing them. F
2811;CAN I JUST SAY ONE THING PLZ CLEAN YOUR SHRIMP/ PRAWNS. Make sure your your oxtail is off the bone and not chewy. Your place looks soo nice but doesn't match the food. The portions and  quality you give for the price is ridiculous.  14.99 for 4 oxtail chunks which don't melt in my mouth is robbery. DONT get robbed like I did I hope they realize what they doing wrong. I didn't try the jerk chicken cause they didn't have it hopefully that is good. I payed 45 dollars for peppered shrimp oxtail plantain (was delicious ) and and brown rice and coleslaw.  I'm just warning others with this review.
2812;This is legitimately one of the worst meals I've ever had in my life. My god this place has horrible food. When we arrived they told us they were out of the jerk chicken, jerk pork, and the smoked turkey. Which were all 3 of the things I would have ordered. Regardless I got the peppered shrimp with brown rice and my friend got the goat with curried vegetables. To start they didn't serve me shrimp, they gave me prawns. If you own a restaurant you should probably put on the menu what the food actually is. It was disgusting. It tasted like the prawns arrived last week and sat in the fridge until I ordered them. They were inedible they tasted that bad. The brown rice was also awful. It tasted like cinnamon and it was undercooked. Truly disgusting. My friends goat was okay but quite under whelming. The curry veg really stole the show though. We opened up the box and it looked like someone had thrown up their curry vegetable and served it to us. And ya, it tasted exactly like that too. In fact I said "this tast
2813;This place is pretty bad. Ordered the fish fritters, jerk chicken and rice. The fritters are burned and tough. Salt fish is beyond salty. Basic jerk chicken.
2814;This is honestly the worst meal I've eaten in a restaurant in I can't remember how long. Everything I ordered was terrible with the exception of the fried plantain. Waited an hour for our food even thought there was only a handful of other customers. My friend and I both ordered the half pound of jerk chicken and it was INEDIBLE - like so dry there was a hard crust where they had cut the chicken breast in half. I sent it back and the staff apologized and brought me another one. Again - super dry and just really really bad. The skin was either soggy or not there, the bbq sauce is drizzled all over rather than basted and it's sickly sweet and molasses based which is not even close to authentic jerk whatsoever. I sent it back a second time and the third time I just told them forget it. The chef de cuisine came out to apologize and informed me that all the chicken is dry like that because they cooked it the day before on the smoker and reheated it that day. I was HORRIFIED that they could serve day-old reheated j
2815;This location is horrid for customer service and getting your order right. We ordered at the drive thru last week and they screwed up the order. Not having time to return we returned later in the day.Bill in hand and brought the concern to the manager. He told us we should have called or returned. He claimed we did not try to call and he could do nothing to compensate us for receiving the wrong order. Today we had a similar experience and called as previously directed. This time we got a different answer we should have brought it to their attention right away . We did . We called. It took 3 phone calls and 3 hours for them to say too bad. Customer service ...not .My advice .. go somewhere else.
2816;I have never encountered a place where they mess up as often as this location. Other Wendy's locations have their errors here and there, but here almost EVERY SINGLE visit is a mistake. The manager doesn't care either. Emails to management have not helped.It can be seemingly little things like no forks or butter for your bakes potato and salad to major things like everything on your burger when you asked for specific things. Check every order and almost every single order is wrong.
2817;Freshii - not!  At least not at this location.  I ordered the Mediterranean bowl and got some overcooked, probably reheated rice and limp salad.  The service was even worse than the food.  The older man behind the counter who seems to be the owner is very rude.  In my short time there I heard him screaming at one of his staff a tiny young girl.  I felt so sorry for her and very uncomfortable.  Couldn't wait to get out of there.  YUCK
2818;Very disappointed! I ordered from this location on the JustEat website, for delivery. My order was for a bucket of thighs and wings, and popcorn chicken with plum sauce. What I received was a bunch of dry chicken breasts, and the popcorn chicken didn't come with any dipping sauce. I called the restaurant to notify them of this, and they informed me that since I'd already eaten a piece of chicken (I was starving by the time it had arrived), they couldn't do anything about it, but they would send the driver back over with dipping sauce. By the time I received my dipping sauce (90 minutes from when I placed my order), the popcorn chicken was cold. What a waste of time and money! I'll never order from them again!
2819;Terrible. Doesn't even feel like a sport bar or like the other wild wings. Also wings were over cooked. There was a reason why it was empty when we went.
2820;Came here for house special soup noodles today. The miserable woman served me. Usually, the food is good, so I'm willing to overlook her rudeness. But today's noodles were soft and I could cook them better at home.  So I will not be returning anymore, I can overlook her rudeness for good food but not for bad food.
2821;Located in the food court on the 2nd floor of the Pacific Mall. Very pedestrian food at restaurant prices. Sat at a sticky table in front of the establishment. The food was not good, in spite of the name. My daughter got an upset stomach and felt nauseous after drinking the soy milk that came with her food.
2822;Waited almost 7mins for my happy meal at second window which nobody in front of my car and forgot about the toy.. And gave the wrong toy after. Very disappointed
2823;The manager of this place, (I didn't get her name, she's a black lady - Jan 30, 2016 @ 11:30pm) needs to be in review. It is really upsetting because her unprofessional attitude towards customers and her colleagues creates a negative image for McDonald's as a whole.
2824;I would say cuz this mcdonals it's always so busy since there is a high school nearby and community center and staffs are not enough so dont expect to have a convenience place to food ... Just very expected as a fast food chain industry
2825;Why cant I give zero stars? This location is horrible, drive through staff will mess up your order, they have ad hoc pricing, charge you extra for say adding extra sauce to an item but never do, cannot make coffee well, and the temperature of the food is pretty well 'cool'. If you have a bad experience at the Milliken Mills McDonalds, please complain to management/the organization or use the McDonalds at Markham Rd/14th ave.
2826;This place still  earns no stars.  Rude service and nickel and dime you for everything.   A senior couple ordered 3 full meals and 2 happy meals. When they asked for a cup of water for their medication the staff said sorry you can buy a bottle for 2.00... wtf?  I say stay away from this location and bring your business away from Mr Chan's McDonald empire.  They all did away with free refills and now this new low... truly a sad day in customer service standards
2827;Disgusting and dirty. Unfriendly staff. Stopped off for an ice cream. The tables were not cleaned with food spilled on the floor. There is no one cleaning the tables.
2828;Ok.This location just gets worse and worse.I'm a patient person, and I do give second chances, but this really ended it for me.6:15pm on weds night.Busy busy busy! I line up for about 7mins. With 4people in front of me.Get to the cashier and asked if the decaf coffee was hot.  She checks and tells me that it is not. I said can I wait for a fresh brewed She says no, that they have to finish the pot before brewing a new one!!Lol. I didn't feel like calling the manager.Enough is enough!!Last time I come here.Not recommended.Service is inconsistent. Or you can say consistently lousy!!I really had enough! I would not even come here for free coffee.0 stars for the last 14months that I have been coming here.
2829;Every time I come here they either mess up the order or take forever to give my order. I understand this is just a fast food joint and not a 5 star restaurant BUT they should at least meet the basics. Went to this location the other night and it wasn't even that busy but they still managed to MESS my order up. Got the all the breakfast (sausage egg mcmuffin) and was craving this all day long. Came home to eat my meal to discover that they put LETTUCE and NO SAUSAGE in my SAUSAGE egg mcmuffin.... Don't come to this location unless you really have to.
2830;The food is good here. The service not so much. The mainlanders who hang out here make everything even worse with their screaming demons running around and climbing on everything.
2831;This McDonald has 2 drive thru lanes but often only one is open and it is poorly designed. As soon as a few cars get in line it blocks the entire parking lot and makes the whole process very frustrating. And the only time I want ice cream the machine is broken so I sat in the drive thru for nothing. Waste of time and unacceptable.
2832;I almost never rate something one star as I feel that if there's some redeeming quality, it should be factored. With that in mind, my visit today fully merited one star.At the time of this review, the other two reviews posted are both negative and the experience is related to the drive through. I should've known better, as I have gone through this location's drive thru before and waited ages each time.Today, I just wanted a coffee. I saw the somewhat long line, but thought (especially given that was raining) that maybe they could still keep things moving. WRONG! It is a location with two ordering stations. It shouldn't matter which one you choose , because surely they'll ensure that they alternate? Wrong again. After one car moved in my lane, they had three cars move ahead on the other side. As I was getting frustrated and waiting nearly 10 minutes without moving an inch, I finally came to the order station. I immediately chimed in fearing that I was going to be ignored, but I was asked to wait. Sure enou
2833;So, an update after sometime.. This place has gone down spectacularly in quality. 12 of us got sick today eating there. They probably recycle food from way back when and the service is no short of horrible ( We had to share napkins at one point..yes) Too bad, place showed a lot of promise in the beginning.
2834;Terrible.The restaurant tries to be everything yet good at nothing. Jack of all trades master of none. So you a have pizza, fries, salad, shawarma, biryani, butter chicken, chow mein, steak and more ... see where I'm going with this. It would have been great if the food tasted well... but it doesn't. Customer service is terrible. Also get some ventilation going. I should not have to smell like bihari kebaba while walking out of the restaurant. Get a better exhaust system.
2835;I was there with my family on a long weekend so it was quite busy. I was aware that it would be busy so we didn't mind waiting in life to get a table for a big group. The door person wrote our name down and it was a bit of a wait but we were up next... but I see this guy who came later then us went inside talked to the manager to get seats before us and that was not good at all we were with kids and they were getting cranky.The whole place was not managed well, ok we got a seat. They were not ready for the big group the food kept finishing up. This place is a buffet and the food was too blend but that what you except. Over all the place wasn't worth the price and the service at the door was not good. Our server  cleaning the table tried her best but it was too busy for her alone to manage a big section where we seat down. The food here is halal.
2836;This was by far my worse experience at this restaurant. Previously, their food had always been OKhowever this time the food not only tasted bad, it was disgusting! I was there with a group of 35+ people and was totally thrown off with the food and the customer service. Their so called Grand Buffet was half empty and some were just filled with fast food items like fries, chicken nuggets, pizza etc. There was no salad, barely any deserts and most of their buffet dishes were empty.  Some traditional items like chicken Karachi, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, fried fish, beef curry were completely missing. The food that was being served didn't taste fresh at all, and the halwa smelled like it was made with rotten milk. I called the manager to complain. This is tall Pakistani women in traditional Pakistani outfit. She was terribly rude and didn't address my issue or listened to what I had to say. Instead, she just grabbed my plate and took off. She had no courtesy to say anything or apologize. Absolutely horrib
2837;This place is horrible if I could give it a negative star I would. There is nothing good here.  The food is terrible the service is terrible. Usually at a buffet there is one good item. There is nothing good here.
2838;Stop!! This place is the worse place to eat because it's the dirtiest, disgusting, and unsafe/unhealthy food that is being serve here. Their food is so old from sitting around for too much time that it's dangerous to eat because my whole family got sick from food poisoning. Please take your family else where if you care about their health and safety. Thanks!!
2839;Went for lunch yesterday, not so great. Not very clean. It needs a face lift.  Food was average, you were only allowed one kebab at a time. terrible service.  The mussels and shrimp looked like they were there for many days.  They ran out of pop(coke to be exact). I will never go back again.
2840;First impression led me to belive that this restaurant would be good. The location is convenient with lots of free parking, however the pictures advertised on the front of the restaurant do not reflect what is in the restaurant. The food was stale, tables and chairs dirty. A woman found a large bug in one of the rice dishes. Not many choices although it states over 100 items, food is not authentic Indian. The only good thing was that the server was polite, but its pretty much self service. Save your money, go to any of the restaurants in Albion and Islington in Etobicoke for some delicious, authentic Indian food!
2841;Let start by saying i have not given any place a 1 star, i gave this place 1 star because i have to, there is nothing less than a *.We had a dis-pleasure of going to this place in Mid October, i had been here once before and did not think much of the place back than.This is a place which mostly offers Indian/Pakistani, Hakka Chinese & middle eastern food.You enter into a restaurant and you say wow this is a really nice restaurant (caution don't be fooled). We were seated glasses on the table were mostly clean but one had a dried lipstick stain on it.Now for the food, very tasteless and blend, seemed dishes were cooked long time ago so were not fresh nothing looked fresh with the exception of fried stuff and Chinese rice.They had problem keeping the serving plates stocked, they kept on running out of food and people had to make several trips to get a one serving (This is the same problem we encountered when we went last time). When i complained i was told that everyone is going at the same time and p
2842;I dropped by on a Saturday for dinner which is a busy time for any restaurant including this one.It seemed pleasant as I walked in and things appeared to be well organized. I was seated very briskly because being a buffet, there was obviously a lot of space.At first glance, things looked good because of all the different choices of food offered. A small appetizer section, an Indian food section, a Hakka section, an Arabic section, a desert section and a fruit section seemed to make this restaurant a holy grail for those seeking different cuisines under one roof.The problem arises when you actually taste this food which by surprise is gravely disappointing. Although there are a lot of options, the food is hardly edible, with the exception of one or two dishes.The service is not much better. The finished plates are left on the tables for far too long. The clean plates became scarce after about half an hour of dinner time. They entirely ran out of desert spoons. There was more than once I wanted to try s
2843;We came for Eid brunch and our crowd was a decent size so we had a room to ourselves. That was the only good thing about this place. The place is nice and clean. The service was ok. The manager was however very rude. Now to the food. Everyone, and i mean everyone in our party of 15 adults and 14 kids, did not like the food. Some of the fruits had gone bad and it stunk. The fountain machine was not working so the owner/manager brought us 2 litre pop bottles from the nearby grocery store, which we understand can happen, but he made a big deal about it like he was doing us a huge favour. But the food was not worth it. Lack of taste on majority of the dishes. Will not be going there again....ever.
2844;Tried this place today in a party of 10, and have to say that it was a horrible experience. The buffet was 27.99 which would be fine if the quality was high, but instead, everything from presentation, service, selection, and quality was bad. All the BBQ is behind a station and is rationed, you are allowed only one piece at a time. Pop has to be bought for and the meal paid for before eating. Want another drink during your meal? Well you better leave your table and go to the entrance to pay for servers can't take orders or accept money. For a $28 buffet, they had two ice cream flavours only in the dessert. Maybe I've been spoilt by Mandarin and such buffets, but these guys really need to step it up.
2845;This place has no reason to be still open.  The very worse service.  Expect a 2.5 hour dinner because you have to leave the table to find someone.   Close this place down.  Went twice (months apart and sat in different areas ) and got the same treatment.
2846;This will be the last time I take a chance on this location. The take-out order was the worst we've had. The chicken was undercooked and rubbery, the whole grain rolls were rock hard, the fries dried out and cold and the sauce was watery. On the plus side the little containers of free butter were at least worth what we paid for them.
2847;Food is typical Swiss Chalet but this location is dirty.  A trusted friend worked there briefly & was disgusted with the attitude behind the scenes.  Dirty.  He told us to go to the employee entrance & you could see the grease build up around the door. Food dropped on the floor was put back on the plate & served.   Our family used to enjoy Swiss Chalet but, after we heard that, we've never had it again.
2848;My experience with this particular Swiss Chalet location was nothing short of atrocious. Went to grab 2 whole chickens for take out. Granted they were a little busy I was told it will be a 10 to 15 min wait which I accepted. After the first 25 min I asked the young lady how much longer it was going to be  as I had guests over.  I was assured it was coming right up. We'll, my order came 20 minutes after that. In total it was a 45 minute wait for something I was told 15 minutes. However, when I got the 2 chickens the problem was that it was extremely dry and tasted like it had been really heated a few times. To sum up my experience, I will never be going back to this particular location again.
2849;This location is the closest one to my home so I went there tonight to use up the last of my gift card(s). I ordered the Double-Leg dinner with fries, to go.Once again, I was truly disappointed with the tiny size of the chicken - a leg and thigh is barely larger than the cup of sauce. I kind of expected that because of my last visit. This time, however, the chicken was salty, overcooked, and very dry. This should not have been served.Thankfully, I now have a zero balance on my gift card and no obligation to return!
2850;WARNING: It looks bad but tastes good...BUT it's not good.  Whole family suffered stomachaches from the food.  We ordered: BBQ: pork and chicken, goat, beef cubes in a gravy and pork short ribs in sauce.  Something wasn't made right.
2851;Very poor service,they served us cold food,and worst part was the HAIR on the food.Luckily I noticed it right away but loss my appetite.Will never go back to this place.
2852;Their barbecue on a stick is yummy and so as their sisig, but the SERVICE? OMFG. shut this place down. You guys suck with your service. It's quite embarassing. Never going back again. Maybe for takeout?
2853;last night  after we watch toronto maple leafs hockey  i don't  feel like eating out and it's  late so we went and we order take out. they have a camera to the kitchen and i saw the other chef picking some of our food and he's  eating  it. That's  disgusting. i pay for my order and said something  to the server but she's  playing dumb. NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE YOU CANT  TRUST THEM HOW THEY HANDLE THE FOOD. WORST EXPERIENCE  EVER. ....
2854;Food is good but horrible service, waitress don't seem to care and you have to remind them about food and drinks more than once.
2855;Did not get to dine in because of lack of supply of food got disappointed as we came all the way from Mississauga and went into an hour and 30 mins of travel time . Suggestion to the management is to anticipate people traffic since they have a viral video and a lot of people are very eager to try their menu and this is a great time to boost their clientele.I would return to taste their famous delicacies and hopefully it won't disappoint me this time.
2856;I agree w/ the previous comment. Service was very poor and waitress kept on telling us that they have only 1 chef  and that was the reason why the food came so late. Food wise, nothing special.
2857;Do not go to this place I know its tempting because they B.B.Q the meat on the outside patio, but that's why i got sick in the first place. I ordered a chicken and pork on a stick from the bbq lady. She freaked out on me when I changed my order within 10 seconds of still talking to her. The chicken was cold on the inside after eating two pieces I took the rest home to microwave to make sure it was cooked. I had a stomach virus which kept me in bed for a few days. Service is horrible and the food was not really cooked.
2858;This location can't seem to get an order right.....save yourself the headache...go elsewhere !
2859;Honestly don't know what I should expect from McDonald's but I think it should be better than this. No ketchup in the spouts, and when I asked they gave me ketchup packets but I sat there and no one changed them. Employees are kept longer than they are supposed too, as one asked the manager if she could go home and the manager, whom was just leaning against the wall, looked up from her phone, looked at the clock on the wall, then looked back down and said nothing.But what got me was the bathrooms. Everytime I come here the bathrooms are gross and unhygienic. There was a used adult diaper in one of the stalls and fecal matter all over the toilets and floors.I get it, it's fast food, but still there should be a bit of quality to hygiene and your employees.
2860;As I sit here reading reviews on how this drive-thru always forgets something, I'm thinking they can't possibly mess up at 4:15am when I'm the ONLY one waiting at the window. I even had to wait on the fresh hashbrowns they put on just for me.Well, I was wrong...because they forgot my hashbrown. Normally I'm used to this thing, and I'm glad I got it soon. But really...I'm your ONLY damn customer!!!!
2861;I don't know why I continue to subject myself to McD's.  Service has slowed to a crawl, and they can't seem to be able to master the timing to serve BOTH the fries and burger hot.  And @ almost $10 for a Big Mac combo, there's no real value here.This location has been updated to the McCafe interior, is generally clean and has a play place if you have kids.  For some reason I feel that the clientele here has a higher percentage of 'the crazies' than most, so you can also look forward to a random stranger starting a conversation with you about their day!  On the plus side you don't actually have to participate, they will talk at you till you fake an illness or walk away.I remember why I like it here, it tastes like the past when I could afford to stuff as many calories as I wanted in my pie hole!  But as the speed slows, I come back less and less.
2862;Each and every time I go to this particular location, it is never a good experience. My number one complaint is the waiting time. Even if I am just ordering a coffee, I am waiting a long period of time. I always see young people working behind the counter and it doesn't seem to be very organized. I also see that friends of the employees tend to hang out by the order counter and it looks like the employees are giving away free food, while a paying customer has to wait.  The order counter is always dirty and the McFlurry machine is ALWAYS BROKEN.  ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS! I would NOT recommend going to this location. Their staff has no respect and I never see a manger around and if I do, they don't look very clean.
2863;This place missed the mark. Came here at 8pm on a Saturday night of a long weekend and they began shutting down food stations. I think that's completely ridiculous. So we had to consume food that's been sitting there all day or noodles that were pretty much stuck to the pan because the steamers over cooked them. I overheard a lady try to get some roast beef but they had no more and weren't going to make more. They also had fresh oysters but it seemed like there wasn't any food safety initiated because they had been left out for a while. Raw oysters out of the shell must be consumed within two hours or else they make people sick. There was also a sign that said "two per person please", which doesn't seem right at a buffet? Closer to 9pm an on shift manager brought in his two friends and they dined together. I can overlook a manager sitting down and eating with customers but he also turned the table diagonally so they could see each other better. The turned table was just so prominent in the dining room it lo
2864;Not what it used to be.We came here on Chinese New Year to experience some not so Asian food.  I was surprised to see many dishes that were far from Asian such as Spanikopita (frozen) and Pasta Alfredo which were passable at best.Most people come for the crab legs,which were so salty that I couldn't even stomach a second bite.  The rest of the food was either cold or lacking any flavor.  If you are looking for an Asian buffet, you are most likely better off going to Mandarin.  On a weekend it cost about 80.00 for 2 people not including any alcoholic beverages, which could have gone a lot further anywhere else.
2865;This place has seriously gone down hill since they opened. It used to be cheap and delicious. Now they suck. The prices are the same as the Mandarin except the food and service is awful. Cold and dried out food. The waiters make up excuses as to why you can't use coupons. I emailed the management the last time I went to complain about how bad our experience was I never received a follow up email. I will never go back here again.
2866;Was visiting friends in the area and wanted to grab dinner before heading home.This was quite the trek for us in the first place.  I heard bad reviews but decided to try it anyhow.  What a big mistake.  The food (IMHO), was terrible. Really poor quality and very greasy.  Not a fan of Chinese buffets in general, but this was truly the worst we've had.
2867;Overpriced, limited selection and mediocre service even below your standard buffet expectations. This place does not warrant the drive there even if it was just to use the BOGO coupons they frequently spam my mailbox with. I am somewhat of a fan of their other location in Mississauga but this is like the polar opposite. Notably absent on weekdays are the AYCE crab legs. I would avoid this place like the plague. CASH ONLY when using coupons.
2868;Too bad Zero stars is not an option on yelp.! Our party of 7 arrived for a birthday dinner celebration on a Saturday around 7pm and the food selection here on is absolute horrible (no oysters or scallops like as advertised). Most of the items were not replenished. The food was far from fresh. Food health and safety board should definitely take a look at this place. For $29 (before tax and tip a person) I really don't know what they're charging their customers for. The place closes at 9:30pm but they start packing away the food before 8pm. It was a very depressing place to dine. I will never return to this location nor recommend my worst enemy to dine here.
2869;Negative stars. Revolting, cheap, ugh.I felt like the food was sitting out all day, after seeing the dessert table I was excited for that, but I was so wrong. They tasted SO stale. Do not go here. You'll regret it!
2870;I find that the quality of food and selections have fallen off. Used to be good, lot of the food served are over cooked and rushed. Deep fried Crab Legs is dry, Grilled Squid and ribs are quite rubbery, fruits was not even ripe enough to eat. I also found a hair on my Sushi. I thought maybe it was my hair at first but when I pulled it, it was partially wrapped in the Sushi itself. Got grossed out! Eeeeeeeewwwwwwkkk!!! I wonder they even have such thing as quality control on food they serve.
2871;Horrible experience in this restaurant . It was good before , but the food was taste horrible now !! The seafood is not fresh at all !! And some of the food r not cooked !!!
2872;I'm not picky when it comes to food and I don't usually complain about it but after my experience today at the Imperial I felt compelled to come on here let everyone know how awful this place is...I've been to this buffet a couple of times in the past and had left there feeling like it was good enough to be one of the buffet options in the area...today was my birthday and my wife and I decided to go there for lunch, I don't know what happened to this place but the quality and taste of the food was horrific. Today.First off there wasn't much of a selection and what was there looked and tasted old... Noodles were rubber ... The Rice were hard and burned... Meats were tasteless and hard to chew.... I tried a series of the dishes hoping to find something id enjoy....each dish worse then the next... at some point I realized it's best I don't need anything because I was worried about getting sick from the food.. so yes on my birthday I left a buffet hungry! After what I just witnessed I can't imagine this place
2873;BAD....OVERPRICED..POOR QUALITY...Indigestion...UGH!Hadn't gone in a couple years but OMG it has gone downhill. spend $5 more and go to Mandarin if you want to hit a chinese buffet.Everyone in our Party of nine was feeling ill later and vowed NEVER to go back.
2874;I was there for the Father's Day dinner buffet and the experience was terrible! The young lady who was the greeter had a a VERY BAD attitude. The service was very subpar as they were severely understaffed for waiters/waitresses. The kitchen couldn't manage to cook most of the food correctly (a lot was undercooked, overcooked or cold) and they were SLOW at restocking empty food bins. The cookies were so nasty that my kids wouldn't touch them. Flatware at the table was in poor condition and a lot of plates had not been washed properly or were chipped. I could go on! This place really needs to close for good or find new management and get better at quality control and customer service!
2875;If I could give less than one star, I would. TERRIBLE food. Awful. Very expensive which we wouldn't have minded if we were able to enjoy ANY of it. Left hungry and $100 lighter. Literally left the restaurant and went to find dinner. To add insult to injury, they charged for a cup of tea. We were actually angry when we left. NEVER again. Terrible, terrible, terrible.
2876;We had been here before a few times and the food was ok. It appeared to have improved a while back which was encouraging, so we went back today. Horrible. The place was almost empty which should have been a clue. I would be surprised if this franchise survives for very much longer.
2877;Horrible service... Came here for my son's team party.  Tried to ordered food but the waitress didn't want to help at all... Told me to go order at the bar with the two other waitress... Incredibly rude
2878;I was visiting my family in ajax and we went to this restaurant for dinner. ..disgusting.  Please beware of this place.   I had a bone in my food that I almost choked on.  I complained to the manager who did nothing about it except take it to the kitchen.   I paid my bill and they didn't even take it off.  I called and spoke with the owner Coomy and he said he would speak to his manager and call me back.   Well he never did.   I called back and he said he forgot.   I asked for a refund and he said he couldn't do anything about it.  The food is disgusting and the customer service is even more disgusting.
2879;Went on a Saturday morning. I heard good things about their wings do I decided to try it. Number of flavors are limited, so I tried the hit flavor. It was dry and tasted mostly of vinegar. No trace of any heat.The waitress rarely visited our table too check on our drinks our food.Suffice to say, this was my first and last time at this chain.
2880;The most shittiest service ever from ALL FRONT STAFF. Went here back in February for a birthday dinner. It wasn't busy at all. Didn't make reservations. *MIND YOU, 1 of my friends USED to work for Boston Pizza. We are a party of 8. There was a table on the lower level and it was dirty. We wanted to sit there and we weren't allowed. Spoke to the manager and she didn't allow us - they did not give us a reason as to why were not able to sit there. They DIDN'T CLEAN the table for the rest of the evening (even when we left the restaurant). We got sat in 2 different booths (YAY..). I don't remember our server's name. But he's tall, dark complexion, buzz cut). Service is terrible, we were missing components from our dish such as garlic bread. We only knew we were missing things because my friend worked there. Food took a really long time to come (app. 40 mins for only appetizers and over an hour for our main dishes). Server forgot to bring our drinks. We asked for Coke 3 times and he never brought it out. 
2881;Came in with my 13 family members - everyone received their food eating away... As my daughter & myself sat here in hunger because our server forgot to put in our order. Server came and apologized 30 minutes later mentioning the kitchen forgot to prepare the order. Lies. You didn't punch it in. Would not recommend coming here with a big fan as they seem to get confused. My family is now starting at us eating & ps it was empty in here. Oh & p.s.s we had to go to the kitchen to address the situation.
2882;This will be simple.We were pretty much here to watch a big fight. The place was practically empty, my friends and u filled up the dining area as the patio was full. Now of course we are a large of people and it took awhile to get us settled although the dining was empty the waitress and hostess looked very unorganized, no communication between the two, and we were stead the furthered from the TV.  We asked the waitress to move us and it's was like talking to air.Their satellite kept failing so the game that we were there to watch kept getting cut off. Had the calamari and the bread sticks, but I would rather go to a different Boston pizza as the experience at this one was not the greatest
2883;I always wonder how boston pizza hasn't gone bankrupt, as every location I ever go to there's something wrong with either the food, or service. At this location, I found a big ass hair in my food. When I got the manager, he suggested buying me a dessert but I still had to pay for my pizzas which I took three bites of.
2884;So,  we go in and waitress comes. She brings us to a table ans we wait 10 monutes to order. To prevent any extra wait, i do my full order ASAP. The pizza looked like it got out from the fridge and wasn't extraordinary. She even forgot to bring us the forks, knives and spoons. Even, the place was half-full, disorganised team, ordinaly food, place looks like a garage
2885;This store deserves ZERO stars, I ordered a bacon battered burger that was deep fried, the burger was so disgusting you could still see the individual grooves of the FAKE hamburger meet we're so clearly visible, it was like a hockey puck. when I told the server that it was absolutely disgusting she said "well how come you didn't say anything earlier" but didn't even notice that I had not eaten more than one bite of the "food" they served me. It was absolutely disgusting, boston pizza has really let themselves go, I used to work for this company when I was a teenager, work on your customer service and your food... Seriously disgusting. No refund was offered or any sort of compensation, they really need a smack in the face wake up or they'll go bankrupt.
2886;Please don't waste your time or money. Had a delivery to the hotel, which may be the problem, and the pizza was absolutely awful. Dry, over cooked, and cold. It was as if they had an extra out back in the trash that they gave us. Don't say I didn't warn you if you try this and you're mad and hungry.
2887;horrible horrible food wayy to salty and i had the steak sandwhich . i asked for well done and i got a piece of charcoal that was  overly salty.. how can anyone not know how to cook some meat??:((( i am still feeling sick this morning with the worst stomach ache ever. if we weren't in a rush i would've sent that piece of garbage away and left to have better food at subway instead...  we asked for the food and bills and paid at one single stop cuz  we saw how slow she was to even bring our food and drinks... i looove boston pizza usually but this location is super slow the waitress was lousy and never again will i go to this location...  i overheard two other tables send their food back for being ridiculously salty and nasty so obviously the cook is prolly the dishwasher too...
2888;I'm just going to copy my complaint I emailed to this restaurant. It took six weeks for them to attempt to resolve this, and this is far from resolution. In my complaint i outlined much was spent. And the situation and circumstances of the day, and the answer to this location is mail the customer a 15$ coupon. Shame on them. Seeing the reviews here, it seems I'm not alone, this location does not care about their customers, and sullies the name of Boston Pizza franchises. My  just turned 6 year old son wanted me to take him to Boston Pizza for his sixth birthday, and just turning 6 on this day, he was sure to let everyone he came in contact with know that it was his birthdayAfter being seated in a quite empty restaurant, the time lapse for our server to come and introduce herself and get a drink order was long enough that under other circumstances I likely would have gotten up and left, but knowing this is what my son wanted, I bit my tongue and waited. Next was something that was rather upsetting and 
2889;Food - 1/5 Appearance - gross/5 Service - creepy/5  Food is alright. I can make better, more authentic, at home. I felt gross after I left. Won't be back.
2890;on par on price with pizza pizza but nowhere even close to goodness of pizza nova. cheese pizza was hours old to me and it was lunch time.Environment: 0 / 5Service: 3 / 5Food: 1 / 5Price Point: 1 / 5
2891;Horrible food. Buffet was cold and hardly any selection. The sausages felt like they were 5 days old. The waitress was nice though.
2892;Came here with a Groupon ($29 for two for tappas buffet) First of all they need to look up what tappas are as the picture is very misleading. Might as well have eaten at McDonald's. They had pizza, fries, chicken balls which literally tasted like McDonald's chicken mcnuggets. WOULD NOT RETURN. ProsAll you can eatCons -Limited food. We literally had to wait for the waiter to bring out more food every 5 min because there was nothing left-NO TAPPAS (all they had was pizza, chicken balls, fries and some cold cut salami) Food was bland. For $30 go to Chipotle across the street and have yourself a feast. Don't waste your time here. -
2893;Was brought to this place by a Groupon. Never again. It was advertised as tapas food, but was low grade minimal buffet with only a few things, like chicken nuggets and roasted potatoes and some olives etc. Was terrible and I got sick to my stomach afterwards.
2894;If I could give negative stars, I would.  My family and I went there for tapas buffet tonight between 7:00 to 8:00.  It was our first time at the hotel and I found the service absolutely horrible.  When we got there, no one was serving or greeting us.  No waitress.  The chef just happened to be there.  So he asked us to take a seat and help ourselves with the food.  After a while, the waitress showed up and served us the wine/beer.  She disappeared on and off again and wasn't there for most of our meal.   Halfway through, we found a millipede on our table.  The first waitress came and saw.  She got scared and ran to 'get help'.  The second waitress (or manager) whom she called came in and said "What was it?  You better not have called me for a spider."  When she found out that we killed the millipede, she said "well then".  She did not apologize to us, but instead reward herself with a slice of cheese that was for the customers.  Both waitress did not apologize to for their poor service.  My question is "Why 
2895;I've been seeing this on Groupon so when my friend got it, I was excited to join her. I was looking forward for the AYCE moment, but I was disappointed when we got there. First, I overheard the lady tell the guy that the tapas was only $10. The Groupon price was 2 for $29, plus tax and tip (thanks for the savings, Groupon). Now that that's out of the way, the food. The food barely had a selection. I feel like a normal buffet place had more appetizer collection than their overall tapas. We had mushrooms, samosa, sausage and chicken balls. Then there were some cheese and cold asparagus, etc. The food wasn't bad, it's just not worth the money. You can do better with what you paid for. I mean, if this is something free that the guest of the hotel gets, then it's cool.  But paying over $15, I mean, you can only eat so many sausages. Please don't waste your money here.
2896;Absolutely horrible, buffet is about 6 mediocre items that all seem to have come from a can or a freezer box. The service is okay but microwaving some bacon, canned beans and breakfast sausage at home would have been better and not cost me 15 DOLLARS.
2897;Expensive bad airport food. Panini is only hot on the outside and cold on the inside. Have to tell them they forgot half the order. Pizza made me gag. Better off getting food from somewhere with a lower price that matches the quality of the food. Metro supermarket serves better fresh2go. This place needs a restaurant takeover.
2898;I should have read the reviews before coming here - it would've saved me a bunch of time, a very mediocre meal, and $17. I have a low bar for airport food, and this was three strikes: overpriced, poor quality, and poor service. I would've rather had a piece of Sbarro pizza or frozen pizza.For starters, the cashier was rude and grumpy. I was trying to decide what to order and asked her which Scacci (stromboli) was good, and she said she didn't eat the food here (that should have been a first warning sign). Second, once I got my food, it didn't come with utensils so I went looking for a fork and knife. Normally, they would be by where you pick up your food, not behind where you order, so I asked the cashier where they were. She scowled at me and waved her hand with a rude, "There". They were out of forks and it took them a good 3 minutes to get someone to replace it, after I had to ask several people twice.Third, not only was it overpriced at $17 (with tax) for a stromboli and small salad, but the food qu
2899;Worst service available even for an airport location.  Don't have high expectations when traveling through airports but here the server told us that it was too hard to make a pizza which is one of the main items on the menu. Instead suggested we buy pre made slices that were more expensive that a whole for a party of 4.  Restaurant is not clean and all around terrible service.
2900;Discussing food and discussing service. Throwing up!!!!!!!! Go to another place in the airport for food. Dirty stinky and discussing food.
2901;I would give this place no stars if I could. I had the worst experience. The customer service is nonexistent. The ladies that work there are too busy gossiping in their own language to pay attention to customers. I ordered a slice of pizza and it was cold. The lady didn't even bother to warm it properly. So I took it back and asked them to warm it a little bit more. One of the ladies at the cash register takes my pizza and tosses it into the oven while giving me a dirty look. She then proceeds to just leave it in there. Five minutes later, another worker realizes there's pizza in the oven and takes out my slice and gives it to me. By now, the pizza is totally burnt from the bottom and inedible. Worst customer service I have seen and it isn't cheap either
2902;We had the eggs, bt potatoes and sausage breakfast.  The potatoes might have cost them 20 cents, they are the lowest grade of tater tots.  The sausage is okay but high in fat.  Eggs are okay but not many of them.  Customer service is worse than you could imagine.  When your food comes someone randomly screams out your order.  Not a lot of competition in this wing of the airport.Avoid this place.
2903;Their Margherita pizza is advertised as having tomato slices, and basil   What you actually get is similar to ellio's frozen pizza. Cheese with sauce. Totally false.
2904;There should be  a law about charging an arm and a leg for airport food when there is no place else to eat. The food has been completely unacceptable, when I am paying 14 dollars for a salad, I expect that the greens are not completely rotted. Customer service is completely non-existent.  I attempted to get a fresh cup of coffee made for my frail grandfather when the ladies behind the counter argued with me for twenty minutes that It was fresh and hot. I proceeded to put my fingers in the coffee to demonstrate that it was cold. I am not looking for world class service, and amazing food, but some caring about the customers would be a bonus. Surely there are better options for a bite to eat in this airport. I suggest that you look elsewhere
2905;Well, I'm never coming back here. The staff don't pay attention or do their job. After we ordered we sat down to wait or our food. When our food was ready our order wasn't called so we wasted a good 10 minutes while our food was getting cold. Not only was our food barely warm it was extremely over priced. A pizza was $14 and it looked like 1/4 of a pizza. Their limited selection was also sitting under hear lamps. Once we finally got our food it wasn't great. It was so oily and it was a panini.... not impressed. I wouldn't recommend this place especially if you are in a rush. Save your time and money.
2906;They don't deserve one star but I don't know how to rate less than one star. Awful service and overpriced foods. A latino cashier was super rude and ruined my day! Avoid this place.
2907;As a millennial I am all about electronics. But when I sit down with someone for a bite to eat before our flight I would prefer not to have an iPad in the middle of the table. The food is very expensive ... 2 Caesars and 2 sandwiches cost me 67.00. I don't like that you have to pay first and tip when all the server does is bring the plate to your table.  I felt really bad for the older couples that came and didn't know how to use an iPad or that it was even possible to order on it. One woman asked the employee making sandwiches if she could get served and he said you have to order on the iPad. When the server came up to help another couple that was sitting at the bar she asked the patron if she was going to show the other patron how to use the iPad (first one was still standing there after the employee making sandwiches told her to use the iPad ) In conclusion: go somewhere else, not worth the price for the sandwiches and the service is less than a subway. At least they take your order.
2908;Unbelievably bad!When I ordered, I was past security. Seated at a table with a tablet that I used to order a single cocktail. It made me pay, and tip, at the time of ordering. I was their hostage. I had to wait, and wait, and wait. I hit a button to call the waitress over several times to no avail. I only got my drink after thirty minutes when I was about to go up to the cashier and complain. It didn't look like what I ordered and it was left on my table by a waitress who said a quick, mumbled "Sorry it took so long" and left. That's the extent of the service I got for tipping well on a $12 cocktail.The management at this restaurant is surely awful, and they take advantage of the fact that you're stuck behind security and have already paid.
2909;Terrible service and over-priced. Their iPad ordering app has the nerve to default the tip to 18% for the grumpy entitled serving staff.
2910;They didn't have too many choices for sandwiches at 5am (understandable) and the chicken feta sandwich seemed like the best choice. Sandwich was VERY dry and the salad had too much dressing. There was little chicken or anything else in the sandwich...I was mostly just eating bread for $14 :( Only ate half of it and threw the other half out in disappointment. Service was very slow even though they had 3 people on staff. They were only serving one other person but it took them a long time to get my pre-made sandwich out of the fridge to heat it up. Well it is the airport and they know you ain't going anywhere else for food lol
2911;Slow service, crappy food, expensive.The servers would sooner spend time socializing with each other and the bar tender than getting the food to the tables.We waited half an hour for the food -- which arrived cold -- and had finished our meals before the drinks showed up!The only upside is that they comp'd it when we complained to the manager... but tracking down the manager was another exercise!
2912;Super overpriced food. I paid for the tiramisu (which btw was $10. For a piece of cake that's the size of 2 bites) then they decided to tell me they didn't even have it. Refund took a good 20 mins, cos apparently supervisor isn't here.
2913;Super shitty food that will cost you an arm and a leg (at least). The man with black hair and facial hair was extremely rude. He should probably actually pay attention to customers instead of flirting with airport employees. Better off going to the Tim Horton's.
2914;Came for breakfast and put my order in.  Then when i went to the window they said they were out of muffins, hashbrowns and egg....then why would you sell it to me. Everytime i come here it happens.  They never know what they have in stock everytime and the employees are very unprofessional sometimes. I went to another timmies down the road and they have never had a problem with my order.  Not once. They need to step up their game.
2915;Came here for a half price wings Tuesday promotion. When we went to order our wings, we were told only the first lb of wings is half price..so for 2 lbs it is 22.50..which isnt what i would consider a great deal. We ordered garlic cheese bread which seemed to have been microwaved seeing as all of the edges of the bread turned rock hard and not edible. Gross. Place seemed very dirty and unkept... avoid at all costs.
2916;I would not go to this Wild Wings EVER! The customer service is retched. Went with my partner and he ordered a Veggie burger with fries - the burger arrived and it had a very distinct smell, he took one bite and almost threw up. We went to tell the Waitress that we are sorry but he couldn't eat this burger, in which the manager said "no you have to take it, you ordered it." After about 15 minutes of saying that we can't even take another bite the waitress was able to convince the manager to let us try something else. We ordered the tacos which were cheaper, and the manager still charged us for the more expensive burger we didn't eat. The waitress felt so bad she gave back the difference from her tips. I didn't expect our food to be comped or anything, but when the food is inedible due to taste, you should at least offer something else. The manager felt it was beyond him to deal with it. Would NOT recommend this location
2917;Wild Wing smells like a piss filled dumpster. Not the cute baby pee that smells like marshmallows and licorice but the concentrated, baked-in-the-sun piss of one thousand elderly alcoholics after an all night bender of southern comfort and miller.The smell doesn't hit you when you enter but gradually permeates your skin and hair.I ordered wings to-go and a beer at the bar. The beer was poured but then forgotten. While the beer was within arms-reach, I feared that I'd lose a hand to the swing of a rusty sword if I attempted to serve myself.I can't comment on the quality of the wings. I needed three showers and four whiskies to get past the smell. By then, the wings were cold and hard.
2918;From the sorry the bathroom is for customers only to poor service and crummy food would explain why on a Saturday night at 8pm the place has two customers$7 for soggy frozen fries and gravy is a rip off. Honestly they were horrible and the fast food drive throughs serve a crisp and hot fry day in and day out....can the chef here not do that?Sorry but the owner should look at the Wild Wings mantra againI cancelled my wings order because I just knew they would mnot meet my basic expectationI am sure Wild Wings does not do any quality checks to ensure EVERY franchise owner meets their criteria on a regular basis because bad experiences like this mean that from now on I would hesitate to eat at ANY Wild Wings againI would think every restaurant owner would take the utmost pride in a high quality experience for their  customers especially in this highly competitive market
2919;Was with a group of 6 looking for a late lunch on a Sunday (Oct. 19 2014) and went to Wild Wing around 2:45. Sign on the door says they open at 2:30. We go in and see all the chairs on top of the tables, and a kid tells us they're not open. We asked him when they open, and he didn't know. So I guess I'll never know if this place is open or not. I won't make the mistake of thinking we can eat there in the future.
2920;My girlfriend and I placed two orders for classic wings. We got home to find out that they were breaded, which neither of us can eat. There was no mention of beaded when we placed our order in store, and no where on the receipt did it say breaded (I checked when we were waiting in store). The fries were also gross and soggy.When we called the store they were unwilling to do anything about it. $30 wasted. I'd avoid this place if you're looking for wings.
2921;Awful experience. Fries came first and were still crunchy in the middle. We were there in January and every time the door opened we froze. The wings came and they were barely even warm. We sent them back and they were clearly nuked. Still only warm but some centres were hot. Would not go back to this franchise. Poor atmosphere and dreadful food.
2922;Ordered through Ritual, paid extra $8 for 2 poutines only to find out there's no poutine at all in the bag, only 10 pieces of fries with my less than average wings. So annoyed right now. Service was also bad even though it was a quick takeout.
2923;To start off i dont think this location even should get 1 star. I went there today and the service was terrible. When we walked in the waitress just starred at us rather than seating us. Finally we just grabbed a seat and she came and gave us the menu. My friend and I both ordered their wings. After eating a few we found a piece of hair wrapped on one of the wings. Disgusted we called the waitress to inform her and instead of taking it and getting a new batch she started to pull the hair out right in front of us. Then she asked us if we wanted a new batch but after waiting a while to get our initial order and after seeing the hair in the food we lost our appetite and just wanted to leave. When we asked for the bill the waitress actually billed us for the wings that had hair in it after we gave it back and didn't order anything else. After arguing with her and her calling her manager she finally took the wings off our bill. Then we asked to speak to the manager and she gave us his number since he wasn't in. Th
2924;After weeks of hearing friends gloat about their visit to Wild Wing, I got it in my head that we needed a treat. I used to love Wild Wing...but this experience sucked! The restaurant itself was small, dark and dank. The loud, drunk construction workers at the bar made me very happy this was a take out order.    To make a long story short....our little (expensive) treat ranged from too greasy to too dry. From flavorless, to too intense. No in-between, yummy goodness. Yuck. It will be a long while before I crave this place again.
2925;I went here for a weekday lunch and ordered a chicken/beef combo plate. The meat was somewhat cold and the rice lacking flavour. The salad had too much cabbage and not much else, and dressing was dumped on it before I had time to respond properly with a "yes or no". Oh! and when I asked for the garlic and hot sauce "on the side", the lady working in an assembly line sort of setup said "sure" and dumped hot-sauce in one corner of my Styrofoam container, and garlic sauce in the other. On top of that, the hot sauce was REALLY cold! and made my luke-warm pieces of chicken and beef even colder and more unappetizing. When we reached the end of the assembly line, the lady informed us they did not take credit cards, and as we took out our debit cards she let another customer pay (in the 10 seconds it took us!!) and then said in a rude tone " So are you ready to pay now?". Awful customer service, the food quality has definitely gone down, and just because you are busy during lunch rush hour does not justify serving 
2926;I can't believe this place is open. My falafel sandwich had zero flavour. My husband who was fasting for 18 hours and starving couldn't even finish his chicken shawarma sandwich because it was so bad.
2927;Wow I've never been so disappointed at a Timmies. Getting an order incorrect when I explained what I wanted two or three times "One order of a large chilli and one order of a regular chilli combo with double double and chips". How that is confusing is beyond me but she forgot the second chilli and gave me a large chilli combo only. Alright. Then the bread was cold. The chilli itself was bloody near frozen on the inside. I complained, she microwaves the bowl touches the hot ceramic and tell me it's hot now. (Everyone knows that unless you either give it some time or stir it all you'll get it a hot bowl with cold food after nuking). Wait why wasn't it hot before? Why did it need a nuking? Told her it wasn't hot again. She microwaved it again. As if it couldn't get worse. After the second of nuking I finally had a slightly warm chilli with cold bread. Didn't replace it like she should have on the second time. Left the cold bread. I was too mad and starvin to just give it back again. Bloody terrible service.
2928;Possibly the slowest drive thru service of all Tim Hortons' in all of Brampton. I avoid it at all costs even though it's the most convenient location to my house. The unfriendly staff makes matters worse.
2929;Not very impressed with this place.  The inside is terribly outdated.  The service is terrible.  I would rather drive a little further and get better food.  The butter chicken was curdled.  The rest of the food was underwhelming.
2930;Disgusting Food.. really really bad, it tastes like a week old type a food.. I ordered beef kabob and guess what it was breheat it by the microwave plus it was frozen kabob.. we r in 2015 and this this my first time in my life eating frozen kabob... I won't eat in this place even for Free.. I don't recommend it to buy it even for your cat or dog cause they deserve better food. .. A place like this should be close ... and am wonder how they are still open. Very outdated...
2931;Purchased a stuffed chicken breast and potatoes from their hotcase. The stuffed chicken breast was not only tasteless, but apparently, I paid for mostly limp chicken skin. The potatoes were undercooked but were tasty as soon as I got them in to the microwave and put some salt on them. All in all, not worth the $11 I paid for this meal.
2932;The staff is beyond rude! Perhaps it is because they have to deal with some very rude and self-important customers? I have shopped here several times and after today I have vowed to never return! The lady at the cash was just horrible! She yelled at the woman in front of me to "hurry up and pay" and when the woman(who was talking to her friend and did not hear the cashier) ignored her, the cashier said"hello!!". Actually, she screamed it at her, I am always baffled at how management could run such an unfriendly establishment.
2933;Overpriced food, rude staff, lots of yelling and screaming in the office upstairs.
2934;A word to the wise from someone who is on the inside but trying to get out. Things are not as they seem at Nortown. The section of "naturally raised, organic meat" is actually the same crap as everything else. And trust me when I say it's crap. The ground turkey? Not turkey at all but a mix of chicken and veal, just like the "group chicken" It's a horrible place.
2935;Actually I too will never return. I heard the owner is a real terrible person. The women I found are sweet. Prices are ridiculous. The hot foods and salad bar look delish but I can cook all these kinds of foods myself. Anyways why would I support such a mean man?
2936;I swear to God I'm being punked. I ordered combo 5 with a lemonade, no ice. What I got was a burger, a ridiculous cup for a small amount of liquid, and no fries. Check out the pic posted. I haven't touched anything. That's exactly what they gave me.
2937;Experience was very uncomfortable. We were seated near the front counter and the short white woman with glasses and braided hair, who I believe is their boss, starts screaming at her employees and this one manager. I felt bad for him. She wasn't only screaming but she was very unprofessional, saying stuff like "I don't need your help!"The girl working on the kitchen was struggling with orders but the woman just kept on blabbing on and on at the back.I'm pretty sure there was a better way of handling the situation without flying off the handle in the workplace? Everyone else working handled it with class and profesionalism. It was almost pathetic to see her treat them that way.As I'm typing this review she's scolding at one employee who seems to be new. Instead of teaching him she's literally banging equipment and screaming at him. Disgusting.
2938;Don't go here. Poor customer service. Waiter/servers are rude and will totally ignore you.I only go here because this is the closest to where I live but they never fail to disappoint me. They are only fast when they give you the bill.
2939;Oh man, this location was temporarily closed for renovations and I thought there would be an improvement in efficiency and cleanliness. Although the space has been updated, it remains filthy and the dining room space was reduced significantly. If you thought things couldn't get any slower you are dead wrong. Now there is only one cashier and the lienups are crazier than ever! Once you order, you will will be waiting in a an overcrowded waiting area with dozens of people waiting for their meals. The food quality remains terrible, they only fill up the fries halfway and I don't know why I continue to eat this rubbish and visit this horrible location.
2940;I would say that's an overwhelming smell of urine. Yeah. That's what that is.  Probably just people have been urinating in the restaurant is all.
2941;Does anyone have the store number for this place. I live nearby and my son likes to get happy meals at least once a week. I think that it is a pity that this place operates in filth. It's disgusting!!!!
2942;Why do I have to torture myself again?!!! McDonald's is sometimes a necessary evil, and I occasionally have to get my Big Mac or McMuffin fix.This location is still the forgotten ugly stepchild of their chain, with the place being poorly maintained, staff not being attentive at times, and it is getting worse. A few weeks ago I noticed the large air conditioning unit was removed outside of the building and the inside of the restaurant was hot and stuffy -- they have to prop the door open to cool down the place.I am guessing that they are hanging on until their lease is over as the place has remained unchanged since the 90's and being left to deteriorate.With any urban McDonalds you will always find the usual homeless, crazy or down & out people loitering, and often times they will steal orders that come to the counter. This is not a place for kids. Unfortunately the staff have little control over this.My last visit, they had stopped serving breakfast at 10:50am, 10 minutes short of the typical 11am cuto
2943;Easily the worst run McDonald's I've ever been to. It's chaotic, everyone disappears into the kitchen occasionally (including the cashiers who are handling money) even though there are long periods with no food coming out...  And of course our or fader and a few others were incorrect. The dining area looks like a  post-apocalyptic high school food fight. Enough said. In comparison,  the Queen/Spadina location is a gem.
2944;The employees were dissing each other and even got into an argument loud enough for all the customers (2/3rds waiting to be served, mind you) to hear. Service wasn't consistent, the cashier was impatient even though I was the only one in line at that point. Pretty sure they also rolled their eyes at me. Body language is important and you'd think cashiers would know that?The restaurant itself smells weird, like chemicals mixed with dirty washrooms. The food was McDonald's. Kinda stale compared to some other locations but not the worst, although the smell of the restaurant was off-putting and changed my impression of the food.
2945;What to say...the food is typical McDonald's, you either love it or hate it.  I happen to love itAs for the service, oh so NOT typical McDonald's!  I'm not here to complain about the drunk people in line at 1:00am on a Saturday.  I understand it is downtown Toronto, close to the Club scene and so the Friday and Saturday (post-midnight) line-ups are to be expected.  But seriously, how many times can one place screw up your order?  I used to think McDonald's drive-thrus were brutal, but this place doesn't even have one, and their error rate is MUCH higher!  As another poster mentioned, do not walk out without double-checking your order (including opening the box/wrapper and checking the contents) because they screw up at least 40% of the time.  As for eating in, you have your choice of the drunks at night on the weekends, or the homeless in the mornings!I like the food, and live next door, so I am doomed to repeat visits.  But understand what you are in for.  I like to refer to this store as "Remedial McD
2946;went at this location rude manager and servers asked for blt bagel without out tomatoes extra mayo and hot cake breakfast with large 7 up and small ice tea no ice it took about 15 minutes one person on the tell and she lost my order i just walked out i was late to go to the post office on king at shoppers  pick pocked on the king 505 street car with a money oder for the usa 40 dollars and a black berry classic phone 640 dollars and house keys will the email to the police about the murder at 101 humber blvd on friday  are not on,that phone   the employee that did not serve me correcti remember my bank card shows time and date so have a happy meal on your self
2947;Perhaps the most frightening place in my neighbourhood. Don't use the bathroom after 1 am or you may encounter copious abound vomit or a homeless person. You have been warned.
2948;This place smells like rotten oil and toxic chemicals. I'd imagine if ebola had a smell, this would be it!It is very dirty.You might be harassed by a homeless person or someone with mental health issues. I was:  - A homeless guy trying to eat his elbow asked me for money as I walked up the ramp  - Another homeless man with tattoos on his face opened the door for me while asking me for money  - Inside the restaurant TWO different homeless people approached me. One had serious mental health problems. One asked for money, one for a coke.  - As I exited one of the first homeless men opened the door for me from the outside and again asked me for mony.  - In total about 4 or 5 people asked me for money there.    (I told them I paid by credit card, which was true)There are bums who stand INSIDE the restaurant who bum money for coffee and food.I think McDonalds should review this franchise. It needs a lot of cleaning. It's like the exhaust from their fryer's are piped into the restaurant. I've never sme
2949;This is the WORST.They just finished renovations and STILL have it screwed up.There was a line of 50 people literally and 1 cashier.  The staff moved slow.I had a quater pounder combo and the burger was like it was prepared in the afternoon and the fries were old...This was horrible and I hope Mcdonalds corporate sees this.Unbelievable...
2950;I went to this place under the impression that it was, and I quote, "The best burger place is Toronto, and my favorite place to eat in Toronto." That was said by my good friend from Nova Scotia who has only lived here for the last 2 months. Unfortunately, I would have to completely disagree with his assessment. The service was poor and slow, the meat was unseasoned and tasted like foam, the bun tasted stale, and the sauces that my friend raved about (over 60), are so watery that they immediately fall off the burger onto the paper. The fries were nothing special, but they did have a unique flavor, one that I would consider going back for.My friend is still adamant that this place is amazing. I guess it floats some people's boats, but not mine. Poor show Nate, poor show.
2951;I just had a really terrible experience with K O Burger.Our food took 3 hours to be delivered, with an interval in the middle where the dude at the store cancelled the order without telling us. They got the wings order wrong and it looks like they left my sad little chicken burger under a heat lamp for at least two of the three hours.I can't imagine I'll ever order from K O again.
2952;INCREDIBLY slow delivery service. Spent hours waiting for food to arrive.
2953;I rarely say it, but this place TRULY is totally ghetto. Only eat here if you are desperate. The food is cheap and completely nasty. I sat with my two friends (visiting from Sarnia, extremely broke and wanted cheap food) as they devoured countless kitchen nightmares - grossly overcooked burger, burnt wings and the most greasy onion rings I've ever seen. It also took an obscenely long time for the food to come out and it all came out at different times.There is absolutely no decor to speak of, there are random furniture bits like couches and armchairs that look like they came from Salvation Army.Seriously - there are countless cheap options in the Annex and there is no reason to consider eating here.
2954;Biggest pile of shit I've ever seen. Ordered online through Just-Eat.ca. Food was late, cold, and they forgot my drink. But to top it all off, the burgers we got had NOTHING ON THEM. What the fuck is this shit, look at it: http://i.imgur.com/Ewf2Jeg.jpgEdit: I highly recommend Just-Eat. I filed a complaint with the restaurant when I posted this review. The guy who answered said the manager was out and that he would contact Just-Eat for a refund. I doubted him and contacted them myself. Excellent customer service got me a refund and a $5 coupon for the hassle.
2955;So mad at this place right now! They give you the option to choose from small , medium and large container of any dish so we ordered large sinigang na bangus expecting that they would fill it up just like any other dish which they did except the sinigang na bangus which i find it funny and makes you mad at the same time and thinking in my head "is this a joke!? I paid $4.50 for this?" One stupid slice of fish and some broth and not so generous with the veggies!!! How can you not find this funny and makes you furious too  you should let your costumer know in the beginning if some of your dish only has one size and not act surprised that we should have known because i don't at all. One lady even says you can pick any size small/med/large and we'd still charge you the same price... WHAT!?!? You're kidding me right!? Makes me not want to come back here anymore. So disappointing!
2956;I used to love this place because of their nutty, crispy fried chicken and pork bbq, but now the flavor was not there anymore. The chicken and pork bbq were so bland. The food degraded and worst the pork steak was not edible and stinks. My husband was so disappointed and might get food poisoned because of the expired pork steak. I will not be back in this place again. People should get what they deserve not expired meat.
2957;Well, you can't say I didn't try. I had a voucher for this place but they require reservations, and they are only open Wednesday to Saturday nights (5 pm - 2 am). I don't know if this business is legit because when I call during business hours, nobody ever picks up the phone AND the voice mailbox is conveniently full, making it impossible for me to request a reservation. What a scam! This place needs to get their act together soon, because I can't imagine many other people are going to be impressed with this absurd level of incompetency.
2958;What a joke of a business.....I too bought vouchers for this place and I think they went out of business last month.  If you look on commercial real estate listings, the space is currently being advertised and it says it was a restaurant until last month.  Bloc Twenty Two had their official opening on Dec 4 and they closed in February?Seriously???
2959;Nice. I bought TWO of these vouchers. That's $60 down the tubes....I'm going to try to get my money back through dealfind.com.  Will update.
2960;This is my exact email to the website when no one care to come back to me a week after I have spoken to the management to report that I had suffered diarrhea and stomach Pain after dining at the restaurant: To the Management,I have spoken to John Para on December 29, 2015 to report a food poisoning that I and my friend when we dine in on December 27, 2015 ( reference check # 117033) we have a couple of pictures what he have eaten that night.  I had suffered diarrhea and stomach pain for two days after eliminating all possible source of bad food I have consumed. I have also learned from my friend that dined with me and my family that she also suffered the same. We have eaten same dessert on the night of Dec 27, 2015 at Louisiana Steak and Seafood located on Steeles Ave West and Hurontario St in Brampton. I have waited to hear from John  until Jan 3. I have called again and spoke to Viki, our server on Dec 27. She told me that she didn't not get any message or notification from the management about my food 
2961;I went there last year as they had a groupon deal. We made reservation, so we were seated right away, however it was not too busy anyway. My friend was asking what beer they had on tap, the waitress listed a couple of beers and he questioned what kind it was, she did not know what he meant. So we asked, is it a logger or ...? She kept on repeating the name of the beer. She did not seem to know that there are different kind of beer. Strange for being a waitress. And then, as she was taking our dirty plates away, my dirty fork fell on me and of course I was wearing white. It wasn't too much of a deal but my friend asked "Are you okay" and funny enough the waitress answered "yes". She did not even apologized and did not bring more napkins until 10-15 mins later.The food was just okay. Nothing spectacular. Service was generally slow. I only bought the groupon because I saw 1000+ people who bought the groupon and I assumed it would be excellent. I guess I should have made more in-depth research.I will never 
2962;Tried this restaurant for the first time and Ordered filet Mingnon and Lobster. Ended up  very dissapointed as it wasn't 8 oz and the lobster as stated was 3oz. Discussed it with our waitress to confirm that my steak didn't look 8 oz. She brought it to her managers attention and he came to the table twice saying he'll see what he can do for me. He asked if he can get me a shot of alcohol, or something else. The food was sub par for the price. You are honestly better going to the keg for size and taste. It's too bad to say this. In the end he kept saying he's so sorry and gave 5 dollars of my meal, and a 2 for 1 coupon which I kindly gave back. I was amazed at the customer service skills of this manager. The service in the kitchen was so slow - waited over an hour, and it really was not that busy for a Saturday night. I can say we won't be going back.I'll definitely will go to the keg,  where I know they pride themselves with exceptional customer service and quality food for their prices.
2963;Why isn't there an option to give zero stars?Fish tasted frozen and horrible  Gumbo had shrimp that were smaller than salad shrimp almost no chickenRice tasted like leftover rice a roniServer was not attentive2 of 4 dishes sent back one intolerable.How do you complain to get a comp for horrible food when your meal is prepaid by groupon?? If we came here and didn't have a groupon we would have walked out without paying as soon as the apps came out.Worst restaurant I've been to in Toronto ever.Disgusting and shameful
2964;I came here because my brother wanted to try a "scotch coffee" that this restaurant offers, and since it was my first time coming to the restaurant and since this was my first day coming back to Brampton from school my brother offered to pay for dinner, however I was so mad with the service we received I chose not to order a single thingWhen we got there, we waited for a few minutes before we were even seated but this was fine to me because the restaurant was next to empty so I didn't expect the server/hostess to be waiting by the entrance. When we were seated, my brother asked a simple question regarding the coffee which was "Is this available for takeout?" and from there the server had an attitude. She was rude and was speaking to us as if we were stupid which is unacceptable to me. I asked for the manager and when he came over I explained to him that I myself am in the restaurant business and would never be so rude to a customer (I completely understand if a customer is being rude, by all means defend yo
2965;I would have put 0 star if I could, That how bad this place was. First walking in this restaurant already felt out of place. The restaurant looked and smell like an old dirty bar in downtown with poor selected music playing in the background. Restaurant is fairly big but wasn't busy at all. The menu have hundred of items on it. We've ordered the coconut shrimp (overpriced small portion deep fried in old oil, it came out dark brown!), clam chowder (just not good), Crayfish (my friend liked the flavour but it was so crazy spicy that he was only able to eat a couple of pieces), Jambalaya (small portion that lacked flavour and shrimp) and the grilled seafood platter (tasted ok, but the lobster tail was really small). On top of the not too impressive food, service was horrible! The wait was long, one of my friend had to wait 10 minutes before her plate came after ours. The whole time, the waitress didn't picked up any of our dirty plates, refill our water or even asked how the food was. There was 3 waitress walkin
2966;This place does not even deserve one star. Literally the worst restaurant I have ever been to in my entire life. I redeemed a groupon and regretted it. I could have spent that money  at Mcdonalds or any local fast food joint for a better meal ( at least they serve their food hot). Heres how the dinner went: Walked in,and the place looked pretty bad but decided to give it a try either way. We received our prix fix menu. the appetizers were not that great but it was the entrees that were HORRIBLE. My boyfriend and I both ordered steaks and both of our steaks were COLD. We took about two bites and couldn't even finish the rest. It was actually quite embarrassing for us to tell the waitress that we were done especially because our plates looked untouched. The only good part about this place is the dessert that we got which was a strawberry cheesecake. My advice is: SAVE YOUR MONEY and go somewhere else where you can actually have a nice EDIBLE meal.
2967;Is there a 0 star?? Where do I even begin. I called numerous times to make reservations and nobody ever picked up. The only reason why we went to this place was there were good ratings on groupon. We ended up getting the voucher from livingsocial instead bc they had a better deal. 120 bucks worth of food for 60 dollars. It did not say anything about a specific menu like for groupon. When we got there .. near empty restaurant.  They didn't even know about the livingsocial deal when we brought it up.. and it took like over 20 mins to get it settled because apparently it was i correctly advertised but seriously it was not our problem. The waitress then got our orders wrong. Then Two plates out of the four was cold.  We got two mains of fillet mignon with lobster tail and the lobster and shrimp mains. Each lobster and shrimp dish came with two lobster tail yet only one was plated for each dish and the rest had to come after. The mashed potatoes were not even real... they were the powdered ones u buy from grocery 
2968;Ok, we saw the reviews and said we would still give them a try. I must also say say that I am from Florida and have had numerous experiences with southern/seafood cuisine. This ain't it.We ordered the frog legs as a appetizer and I must say that the batter was tasty. The shrimp cargot was also tasty. However, this is when things took a turn.I must validate that if you are in a hurry you might want to choose somewhere else. Service is slow but I must say we had a friendly and informed waitress.We ordered the Stuffed Salmon, Chicken wraps, Arotto Chicken, and the Fish and chips. We were not impressed.The Salmon was good but the rice had no flavor. The chicken wraps were alright but not too flavourful. The Arotto chicken was heavy on the pepper and the fish and chips was very bland. To top it off it is pretty pricey. This totalled $125....not worth it. I wanted to give a better review but in good conscience can't. I will not return.
2969;Saw this Groupon and was in the neighborhood so I thought I would try it out...bad move.Waitress was on the rude side.  Seemed like she didn't want to be there.  Spoke quickly and did not make us feel welcome at all.  However as the night progressed she seemed to get better and by the end she was smiling...maybe cuz she didn't have to serve us anymore????For Groupon goers its a different menu than the regular one.  Food did not have that "Louisiana" taste/feel to it.  Mussels were small and didn't get a lot.  The scallops in my pasta were frozen, not fresh....or maybe it was shrimp?  Idk..I think I've blocked the experience from my mind :SFor a place with "Seafood" in the name I thought I would be getting a better seafood experience or at the very least a Louisiana tasting.  The whole ordeal was prolonged by the SUPER SLOW staff and cooks.  I was there for may be 2 hours??Not worth your time or money.
2970;Absolutely terrible food. When this place first  opened years ago their food was awesome! I used to come here with my dad all the time and I remember how great it was. I'm pretty sure they have new owners now. We only came because I bought a deal off of WagJag  ($20 for $40 off of your bill) I had the rib eye steak with mashed potatoes and veggies. The steak was awful, it had zero taste at all. No seasoning, no flavor, just grilled meat. I'm almost positive the mashed potatoes were those powdered potatoes, they were awful too. Hubby enjoyed the mussels though. The service was slow, food took a long time and the restaurant was relatively dead. The woman who greeted us when we came in was very pleasant, our waitress was nice enough but the food was not good at all. I sent back my meal and opted for a wrap instead that I could take home as it was getting late and we couldn't stay any longer and when we got the bill, the steak meal was on there in place of the wrap and was nearly $10 more. When I asked about it 
2971;Its with a heavy heart I write this review. Louisiana seafood used to be one of my favourite place and one a place I would recommend often to people. The quality has gone down. Very badly. The food used to be so flavourful before now it is just bland. The service was always okay, but now was horrible. We went on Monday for all u can eat mussels. First there was never enough then they either put too much salt in or no garlic. They did not want u bring new utensils out they asked we used the same ones we had. The mussels leftover bowl. They just kept washing it and bring it back. The plate was never wiped down so it was always wet. When I got there even though the place was empty they asked me to wait like 5 minutes prior to seating us.  It sad when a good place goes bad. I am hoping this review get notice of management to make some changes to the place.
2972;I normally do not give bad reviews. But this restaurant deserves it. Came here with a group of friends and redeemed our Groupon. First impressions was that there was literally 10 people in the restaurant, a lot of empty tables. I already knew this was going to be bad. But I wanted to give it a shot.We order from the prix fixe menu - 3 course meal. Appetizers we're ok, nothing extraordinary. They were cooked properly and had an ok presentation.We receive our entrees and this is where it goes downhill.  My gf ordered the angus steak and it was "cold" (it seemed as if it was sitting for 20 mins before it reached our table). I didn't complain since I never trust food going back to the kitchen especially at this kind of place. I ordered the ribs and it arrived somewhat cold. My friend ordered Caesar Salad and the lettuce had a slight tint of red (I'm not sure if these people prepare blindly or not). But you should know that you never serve lettuce that's bad. The only thing that could save this whole exper
2973;Not worth the money nothing about this place says or taste like Louisiana. Started with the chicken wings which were flavourless... Moved onto the steak which was equally as bad.... Finished with the apple crumble which was ok.... Girlfriend had the ribs and and ate a grand total of two ribs off the two racks before boxing it up to take home to our garbage compactor of a son.... Like another reviewer said just go to the KFC (and I hate KFC).... Place sucks.
2974;I purchased a Groupon in April 2014 for a a three-course meal for two people at Louisiana's Seafood Restaurant in Brampton for $59 because i wanted to take my twin sister out for a nice birthday meal.We went on Wednesday night at 6:30pm. We didn't leave the establishment until more than 2 hours later.We ordered the chicken wings and mussels for appetizers. Many of the 10 mussels were broken and closed. The bread that came with it looked like the frozen variety from no frills, came untoasted and cold.We had the bourban ribs ($23) and salmon(420) for main courses. This is where it gets more than ridiculous, the mashed potato I was served was powder potato, it is the same kind as the ones in the hungry man meals. The ribs tasted exactly similar to the boxed ones doused in barbeque sauce. My sister can attest to the potatoes because she tried them as well, there wasn't a single part of it that was actual potatoes.My sister's salmon stuffed with shrimp was so gross she had to eat just the outside crust of 
2975;If you are in the neighborhood, skip this place and just head for Red Lobster.Prices are similiar and food tastes better.Interior layout was odd, bathrooms were gross and the place is falling apart.Serving staff was ok but I will not go there again.
2976;worst seafood place on the face of the planet haven't been in years, not a fan i'll never go back
2977;We visited this restaurant after almost 2 years and were shocked at how the quality and taste of the food had fallen. The wait staff was ill informed and though the restaurant had just 5 occupied tables, they were slow. The craw fish tasted like it had been frozen badly - the flesh was spongy. The gravy it came in was not cooked long enough thus almost bitter. Everything else that we ordered was passe'. I am sad to say, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
2978;Not a fan of this location, since they do not honour promotions that all other Quiznos honours.I recommend the location at Adelaide and Yonge.
2979;The problem i have with Quiznos is that it always feels like the owner/operators just had a meeting with their staff about how to keep food costs down. It could be a good sandwich, but the ingredients are so sparse it just doesn't feel like I'm getting my money's worth. The sandwich maker weighed my chicken on a kitchen scale so delicately that it felt like i was buying raw gold. Like really, is that extra ounce of chicken going to break your profit margins?It's cheap, but not in the sense that benefits the consumer.
2980;Not worth visiting unless it's late and there's nothing else open (they're open 24/7) or you have coupons, since the base prices are exorbitantly expensive for a shitty fast food restaurant. You'll pay over $11 for a standard combo and Burger's Priest this is not -- but they price it like it is. If you're there after 10PM, they won't give you a frosted mug, which wouldn't be so bad if they actually had ice to put in your flimsy cup. Warm, flat pop in a flimsy cup.The fries were fresh cut at some point, but have since been frozen and taste like stale mush. The burgers are dry and crumbly and have way too much sauce on them. The onion rings are super-salty and it's hard to eat more than a couple of them as a result. The staff are terrible. There was a young Indian girl (I'm only mentioning ethnicity so they can be identified, as I didn't get their names) on cash who was new and she got berated in plain view for a good 10 minutes by a black girl for an earlier mistake while the lineup got longer and longer
2981;Had a very disappointing visit here yesterday. Personally I haven't had A & W for about 10 years before this visit and now I remember why. Really I only went because it was the closet place around at the time.Upon first impressions staff was friendly and efficient when I ordered my food. Then I sat down and began eating, I was almost done my burger when I noticed a hair sitting on top of my beef patty. I was not going to say anything because I was trying to be understanding and not cause a scene but as a culinary school graduate who works within the food industry and is knowledgeable about sanitation and food safety, this is unacceptable to me as a paying customer. My mother who I was with brought it up on my behalf and was told, "Sorry about that but she ate 3/4 of the burger so I can't replace it." Although I told her I understood that I believe there should have been some act of good will towards the customer. Now I feel like they only care about you until they have your money.I ordered feeling optim
2982;Went there with the wife for dinner. The place looked closed with all the lights off and nobody inside. Only the open sign made me try to open the front door. Once inside the owner turned on some lights and we sat down in a booth. Not sure what was going on with the booth but there was missing padding and i ended up sitting on boards. We looked through the menu and i made a joke to my wife about them labelling the noodle dishes as Asian Pasta, i really should have started to worry at that point. The Spring rolls came out and they were ok.Its is when the Pad Thai came out that the night took a turn for a nasty worse. The sauce tasted of tomatoes and vinegar, being really hungry I tried to ignore it but could not. Looking across the table at my wife who was also making a nasty face about the Pad Thai I tried to get the attention of the owner who rather then come over started to print our bill. When i brought him the two plates of Pad Thai and asked why it tastes like acidic he told me that was how they
2983;How is this place still in business, especially considering the area it's in?  Horrible service!  The staff barely understand English and even when you point to the item on the menu you want, they still bring out the wrong thing!  And, to top it off, the food takes forever to come out!  My husband and I ordered spring rolls (15 mins to come out and we were the only ones in the restaurant.  Staff just standing around taking in their language).  By the 40 minute mark, we got up and paid for our spring rolls and told them to cancel the pad thai and chicken dish we ordered as we ordered it 40 minutes ago!!! Not the first time this has happened, but this is the last time we'll be here.  We now frequent a much better thai restaurant with a nicer/cleaner atmosphere, friendly staff that understand your order, and cooks that know how to make thai food and in a reasonable amount of time even when it's busy... That restaurant is Riz (the location on Avenue Road south of Eg).  This Thai One On place is a joke !  Close 
2984;I too neglected to yelp this restaurant before ordering delivery, never againWhen the best thing you got was spring rolls you know there is an issueMy order was small. shrimp phad thai, beef devil and beef with glass noodlesThe shrimp phad thai was tasty but looked and tasted like imitation phad thai equipped with phad thai sauce, stay awayThe beef devil was billed as spicy but was sweet and was generally a regrettable menu choiceThe beef with glass noodles was also billed as spicy but sadly disappointed, lets just say yelp will accompany all of my future orders, anywhere
2985;Don't bother ordering from Thai One On. I ordered food online at 6:23pm and got a call at 6:32pm from the store asking if it was okay that my food be delivered between 8-8:15pm. That's insane! almost 2 hours for my order to arrive when the website says it would be delivered in 45-60 minutes. The man on the phone said they only had 1 driver and my location was "far". I don't understand how they only have 1 driver during peak hours. Their website also states that they deliver across the GTA, so it's ridiculous that my location would be used as an excuse. I asked for a refund and he gave me a number to call (apparently the actual stores can't issue refunds?). Long story short, I'm now out $53.00 and hungry. Horrible and completely unacceptable experience. No one even apologized. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY.
2986;Ordered online from here tonight - got an entree (Thai Spicy Coconut Eggplant) with apps and a drink. Was very difficult to eat as it came without rice, which was not noted anywhere in the ordering process. SO disappointing. WHen we called to complain they told us it was our own fault. Really bad service. Won't order again.
2987;So placed an order around noon on orderit for food to be delivered at 6:30. Delivery guy called me at 1 trying to deliver and had to call the restaurant to say the order was clearly placed for 6:30. Around 6:45 and no delivery yet I called the restaurant. The guy clearly know what the order was as he remembered my apartment and I didn't need to specify it. He assured me it was on it's way. I called again at 7:30 wondering what was going on as still no deliver and it was now an hour late, again the guy said it was on its way and just really bad traffic and they only had 1 delivery guy. I called again at 8 and demanded to speak to the manager who claimed I never placed an order with them despite having the email confirmation and seeing the pending transaction already charged to my credit card. Ended up calling orderit to cancel my order as these guys clearly have no idea wth they are doing.
2988;Good food can't make up for bad service. Was on Avenue the other day with a friend decided on this place for dinner. BIG MISTAKE. I walked in and sat down, it was pretty empty. Was looking at the menu then was informed I was looking at a takeout menu she brought the regular menu. Was looking at goat curry which was $2 more on the dine in menu. Then on top of that for rice or noodles they were charging another $2.So with all that my bill is at $17+tax. My curry comes, it was good but my noodles didn't waited, and ask 5 minutes later. The sever forgot, would have been nice if she wrote it down eh? I canceled it, In the end she charged me the take out price but I am never coming back here again and would never recommend this to anyone.
2989;Came here for a large chocolate dipped cone and a lemon lime slush on a blazing hot summer day. Cashier signal me to step aside and give way to the person behind me to order while I was waiting for mine. So, I politely yielded the way and stood at the far end in the corner. Only to see the gentleman who ordered after me didn't move at all, everyone else was crowding in front of the counter and I was singled out to not get in the way. Cashier yelled out my order and never attempted to identify whose order was it. She handed out my dipped cone to the gentleman at the counter without asking, and that man took it without any hesitation whatsoever. Only then I confronted him about it before taking it back from his hand. I later found out he didn't even order a dipped cone. What's going in this store?
2990;The food was terrible. My colleague wanted to go there for lunch just to give it a try. The person putting together our food seemed very unsure about what they were doing. And asking for extra ingredients (I asked for extra hot peppers) was met with confusion, and the manager stepped up and said finally to add the peppers. The food was terribly bland and they were very stingy with the sauces, as in they put the thinnest layer possible in the sandwich. I threw half of my food away, and my colleague was not happy with his.. throwing out the last couple bites. I also had a rice crispy treat which was very stale and had a chemical taste. Awful food, not worth what we spent. Never going back. You have been warned.
2991;I came to this restaurant for lunch with friends and we were disappointed with the lack of customer service. Our waitress was visibly annoyed after we asked for more side dishes (we asked for more side dishes a total of two times for the eight of us eating there). The way we were treated was cold and unwelcoming. The food itself was average, I had the cold noodles, nothing about it stood out particularly. I would avoid this place when hanging around first Markham place in the future.
2992;Don't go here. The server insisted on more tips even though the service wasn't satisfying and the food was not good either. I got the bibimbap and it was just so plain and dry. Recommend going to 100 percent Korean at steeles instead.
2993;The cold noodle is TERRIBLE. No flavour and all the noodles are stuck together. Bad experience
2994;Very expensive with little substance.The lamb in the $15 lamb stew was so over boiled that what tiny amount of lamb they did use had almost entirely disintegrated. It was also really over-spiced.
2995;This place doesn't deserve any star but I had to put something down to write a review. It was a blood boiling experience having to deal with  grumpy servers there. I have been to the Yonge and Finch location and found the experience ok. Maybe they decided to send the moody staffs to the FMP location.I was there with my friends and their parents for a gathering. We decided on this location since the food (from other Nak Wons) were decent. I don't remember much about the food because I was too consumed by my growing rage. The servers are perhaps on a competition to piss off their customers because they were excelling at that from start to finish. I sensed the hostility at the time of ordering the food because of a very grumpy tone and face. When we asked for another round of side dishes my friends parents were nice enough to stack the side dish plates for the servers since we are running out of place. We thought it would be easier for them to take it away. Instead of just doing their job they nagged at us for
2996;This place is the worst restaurant I've ever been to.  we went at a time that was not busy and there were Like only two tables there and it still took them forever to serve us and get our food. the longest wait ever. food was mediocre. we had no water and the waitress kept on ignoring our bell rings and told us to wait when we finally caught her eyes attention. She never did come over though dispite more rings and handwaves. Felt like they purposely ignore us the whole time. we will never go back ever.
2997;This place is terrible and disgusting! They have a roach infestation! never never go here!
2998;Service here is so terrible. We came at 10:30pm and the restaurant closes at 11pm. The staff was rude to us the entire time from taking our order to bringing our food. I asked for another topping of sides and they didn't bring it for us, instead they brought us the bill and shooed us away.
2999;Jeezus... of all the Nak Won locations I've eaten at, this one easily wins the award for Worst Service.  Hands down, no contest - ding ding ding!!  You win first, second, and third place, Nak Won@FMP.Some of the service to expect if you eat here:- Throwing everything onto the table ridiculously hard, including cups of tea that half spilled out- Waitress kept walking by but ignoring us, had to wait 20 mins before she stopped to take our order- Her entire vocabulary for the night consisted of a whiny grunting noise, that sounded each time like I was asking her to pick up dog poop- Forgetting the coke we ordered, having to remind her twice, then getting attitude for it- Giving cut eye when I asked for extra napkinsAt the end of it all, I walked up to the counter to pay by debit.  I grudingly punched in 10% for tips, and almost immediately regretted it.  The old lady there pulled out the little receipt, inspected it, then said........wait for it.........get this...:  "Only 10%?"ONLY 10%???  Are you effi
3000;Don't come here for dinner on the weekends.  The restaurant looks large on the outside but they are severely understaffed inside.  Waited over 15 mins just to get tea and cutlery on the table and had to spam the bell they have on the table multiple times in order to get service.  Staff is not very pleasant, possibly because they are stressed out.You can get more authentic Korean food elsewhere, we only came here because Tofu House was closed that day.
3001;Please, don't ever eat here unless your a fan of bugs and hair. I've had bad experiences with them before but today just topped them all. 1. As usual the service was GARBAGE. The servers were so rude and just nonchalant about how they represented themselves. 2. The food was mediocre.  3. There was bugs and hair in our food!! The first dish we had we nearly ate a bug the size of my pinky finger. Their reaction? Oh, okay. No apology, no discount and no replacement of our dish. The second time we presented a live bug in our dish they didn't do a single thing. I found hair in my spicy rice cakes too and by then I juat didn't bother to notify them. This place should be shut down. Its dirty,  the service is crap and they really harm the reputation of Korean restaurants. I truly regret giving this restaurant a second chance. Stick with Nak Won at Kennedy and Highway 7. They are the best!!
3002;Food is crap. Jajiangmien is salty,  pork bone soup has no pork flavor, glass noodles have no taste either. Service is a fine just the quality of food is lacking.
3003;This location's customer service is SO consistently bad that I subconsciously accepted that as the norm So when I went to LA and received above and beyond customer service by the Korean restaurants there, I quickly snapped out of it and realized this place treats their paying customers like craaappppppp and that's a problem! The workers act like the last thing they want to do is serve you yet that is what they are there for. The taste of the food here is also very inconsistent making my experience here only sometimes somewhat kind of enjoyable. There are actually a lot of Korean restaurants uptown and I don't know why I always gravitate towards this one, maybe because I used to frequent the Yonge and finch one. BUT moving forward I don't think I will be coming to this location to eat anymore.p.s. Refer to the other reviews for specific examples of bad customer service from this place . Mine are similar so no need to reiterate :)
3004;Huge restaurant with only 3 very unhappy staff. Took forever to get what we wanted. Prepared us the wrong dish, did not apologize for it, gave us a dirty look, and re-brought back to us the same dish with a few added glass noodles. Really not family and kid-friendly. Food is ok-good, but the experience was so bad that it was the only thing we took away from this restaurant.
3005;Going downhill from my last visit take out style.....ordered the tofu pork soup for my wife at home.....get it home and they decided to put the soup with tofu and pork in a clean plastic bag tied at the top, then they put that bag in a tall Styrofoam container with lid on and then they put that in another clear plastic bag tied at the top and then they put that in a take out plastic bag with a side of rice and Kim chi. Why would my wife want her soup to taste like plastic bag and why is the soup packaged and treated like it was bio hazard material?Big FAIL.Lost my business for good and to the chef or food packer that packed soup like that isn't thinking or is over thinking something that is simple and has a tried and tested method from the decades of takeout places all over the world.
3006;Today I am really pissed at myself.  Because I agreed to give this restaurant a second chance.  And they did it again.  The servers there obviously don't want to serve their customers.  They absolutely tried their best to avoid eye contact.  It was like that during my last visit three months ago.  Today for ten minutes we sat there without water or menu or even a simple greeting.  And this time I decided to cut my loss and walk out.
3007;ZERO STARS. Be prepared to receive the worst service ever. Waitresses carry a really bad attitude. They are impatient and incompetent, not to mention super SLOW. The problem might be that this restaurant needs to hire more wait staff, but there is no way a customer will feel appreciated here with this type of service.We were seated rather quickly, but took 15 minutes to flag down someone to just take our orders. Most astounding of all, was when the food arrived. The waitress stood beside my seat, expecting me to move over and complained that the dish was "Too heavy" so she must place the plate right between me and my boyfriend. We thought, okay fine.. maybe it was too heavy, but dishes after dishes arrived where they just hand it over to you, or place it right beside your utensils, not bothering to move or re-arrange the dishes in the middle of the table. The waitress was also very rude when I couldn't take the dish since I was in the middle of eating. I have to point out that the RINGER at your table i
3008;We were craving for pork bone soup for dinner but found our go to restaurant at FMP was closed. We thought we'd give this place a try. The restaurant was busy when we got inside, but still a few larger tables available at the back of the restaurant. We were third in line, I tried to get the waitress' attention so we could get our name down or grab a number however no luck. Five minutes gone by, at this point more people were flowing in and we still did not get any service. I started to realize there was no system in place to get people seated. I was with my mom and carrying my two year old son, he was getting antsy at this point. They were cleaning up tables and then ended up seating other groups that came after us. We tried to complain but with no luck. After 25 minutes of waiting we ended up leaving hungry. This place is horrible, we will never come here again!!!!
3009;I ordered the pork tofu soup. When it came it was a pale beige colour. It tasted very bland like just hot water and tofu. I was trying not to be a difficult person but I had to send it back. I called the waitress over and she acknowledged to fix it for me but then she completely forgot! until we reminded her I was still waiting for my soup. The same bowl of soup was brought back to me. The tofu was all broken into very small pieces, the chef must have stirred it vigorously. All they did in the kitchen was add more salt! The soup still have no flavour except it was very salty now! I was really disappointed and will not be returning againI have been to restaurant once before about a year ago and it was actually ok and I ordered the same thing. I returned again a few nights ago and I was appalled....
3010;Okay, firstly, I will give this place the fact that they do offer very cheap Korean food.  This place does offer various Korean dishes at a very affordable price.However,  the service here is the WORST service in the GTA.  I have been here a few times and every time they are incredibly understaffed.  They have 3 waitresses waiting on almost 30 tables, which is completely insane.  As such, the waitresses are incredibly rude to you and really do not care about your food or your request.  Do not come here if you want any type of customer service, you will get none.You actually feel bad for asking the waitress for more tea.  She will give you cut eye.  You actually feel unwanted in this restaurant.
3011;My cousin and I were craving for Korean food and we wanted to go some place near Richmond Hill (since we usually have Korean food in Koreatown)....when we arrived at First Markham Place, we were deciding on whether to go to Owl of Minerva or Nak Won...eventually we chose Nak Won only because it looked more 'decent' from the outside. Anyway, as we entered, we were told where to sit and received our menus. After 20 minutes of realising that they won't be coming to take our order any time soon, although there weren't many customers, we decided to call for the waitress. After placing our order, the food arrived after a while. As she arrived with our food, my cousin & I were lost in a conversation when we were interrupted by an annoyed "Hey!" from the waitress requesting us to MAKE SPACE for the dishes....like seriously?! Are WE the ones that were supposed to 'clear' the table? As the food were set on the table, we had ordered DukBeoki, which wasn't HOT/WARM, and the side dishes were poorly prepared. From this mo
3012;This place had typical Korean food. But the service was horrible. I with I could give a zero star because they treated us like we were bothering them. We ordered spicy soup but my friend doesn't eat spicy so we asked if we could change. She said no rudely. Then later, our rice was poorly cooked so we asked for them to re make it. But she just microwaved it and also gave us a bad attitude. Later, I heard her  talking behind our backs saying we were causing trouble for them. Other things we asked for like bowls and chopsticks were given rudely to us. Overall, I was very displeased with the service and therefore will never come back ever
3013;I like the food! I like the big menu... many choices... and the price was reasonable. I know nothing about Korean food, and today was my 2nd time eating it (aside from Korean BBQ), and I liked my dinner that night. I didn't notice dirty food or anything.. the place looked clean. The washrooms were alright too :) Every table had a buzzer to call for service, which was convenient.YET... 1 star, why?? Aside from the food, I hate the service!! I'm NEVER going back!! We asked for water, and she slammed a water pitcher (a $5 plastic water bottle found in Asian markets) on our table. No cups?? We asked for napkins and he dumped a pile right in front of my friend,.. wtf. Gently, maybe?And we asked her to take a photo for us, and she had this "omfg why am i doing this for you" look. She took it when no one was ready, gave the camera back to us so we couldn't ask her to take another, and walked away pissed. WE should be pissed! The picture was blurry! Basically, the service was "hurried" and rude. And NO, the r
3014;Not even worth 1 star! After 6 months not visiting this place, tonight just give them a second chance and guess what, even worse. First start with the same ill-manner waitress that didn't even bother to serve you. Then while we were checking out the menu, the table next to us was eating the just arrived pork bone soup and she paused..... She then dug out a black "6-legged" mini bug which had antenna that was long enough for her to hold up with her fingers. WHAT THE HECK!!!! Guess how they dealt with the situation..... The waitress just took away the soup, said sorry and gave them 2 cans of pop.  We debated a while to see if we still wanted to eat at this place and decided to try our luck. Guess what, they had a bell to call for service and we pressed it once.... No one came but they kept on passing our table. Pressed it again and no response. Pressed the third time and we decided we had enough! The waitress came by and told us not to press the bell so many time as they knew we pressed. I had enough and walk 
3015;Terrible service, period. Ask for a baby chair? Get it yourself. I've ate here many times over the years and it's the same terrible service all these years.
3016;Came here for dinner with 2 other friends and I swear I will never come back to this restaurant again. 30 second review:side dishes: 0 out of 5 stars. Kalbi 4 out of 5 starsPork Bone Soup 1/5Bibimbap: 2 out of 5Service: 0 out of 5 starsLong review:The service is just horrible. I eat a lot of Asian food so I am use to bad or non existent service, but this place is the worst of them all. The servers just waves her hand at us asking how many in an extremely rude way. While we were taking off our jackets and sitting down she just slams the menu on the table. After a few minutes we asked a different server to take our order, she didn't even ask us if we wanted the pork bone soup hot or mild. Before we could even tell her she ran off. Good thing she came back a minute later with the side dishes. We told her we wanted the soup to be spicy and she didn't even reply with a nod or yes. When we asked for a few extra bowls for sharing she kissed her teeth at us. Uhm, really? The worst part is, the place wasn'
3017;Food has been very mediocre as of late. Soon tofu isn't even up to par. Side dishes were ill prepared, the flavour just wasn't there, I could have probably skipped the side dishes if I knew before hand. I would rather eat at the food court next time for Korean food too. Service is okay, but what really ruined the experience and the reputation it once had (or never had since the finch and yonge nakwon was hands down always better) was when I got the bill. It came to about $23.70. I only had $5 and $20 bills. I was going to wait for my grandma to see if she had change, since she usually carries a coin purse. I placed $25 into the tray and waited for my grandma. One of the waitress walked over and pointed to my bill saying only one thirty, look only one thirty. Basically saying that I wasn't paying enough tip. Who does that... It's called tip for a reason, not a forced price.
3018;It was a Saturday night, 8:30pm.We had a party of 9."Well, there's your problem right there!" you may say, but nay! We had our table in 5 minutes!...we had our order paper (with "SEPARATE BILLS" sprawled across the top) taken 35 minutes later, despite ringing the bell and flagging down waitresses a couple times. ...our banchan (appetizers) arrived 45 minutes later....our party's first order arrived another 35 minutes later....our party's only order of dolsot bibimbap arrived 15 minutes after that.Needless to say, we saw quite a few tables of 2-5 come in, eat (,pay) and leave before we even got our appetizers. This did not make any sense whatsoever.One of our party members had to leave and was able to pay his portion of the bill separately. When we asked for the bill and reminded them we mentioned we wanted it separately, the waitress vehemently denied separate bills were possible. And that was the straw which broke the camel's back...We retaliated with simmering complaints.Waitresses yelled at
3019;Watched a cockroach climb out of my friend's meal. The waitress didn't seem to think it was a big deal and still charged us. I'll never be coming back nor will I recommend this place to anyone. My coworker went on a separate day and also saw a cockroach crawling at another table months before this happened. Too bad I wasn't told sooner or I wouldn't have came!
3020;Avoid if you want an enjoyable night.~~~~~Went on a Saturday night. Party of 10 with reservation. I showed up early and a lady just litterally points her finger vaguely to the back of the place. It's my first time there so I wandered as far as the washroom before back-tracking and peeking into rooms to see where this 'table for 10' is. Finally found it in a corner right before the hallway leading to the washroom. I awkwardly walk around the table once to make sure it's mine, and notice that they have the buttons to call someone to the table. Meanwhile, the same lady tosses a few menus on the table then promptly leaves. No tea, no water, no smile, nor paper to write our order. Meh, whatever, I'm in a mellow mood. Since I was early and the only one there, I take out my tablet and start playing on it so I wasnt able to hear all the ambient beeping. My friends soon arrive and we pour over the menus to see what we want. A few of us (me included) are thirsty now so I decided to stick my hand up to get the att
3021;Agree with most of the people who had given the rating of 1 star. Regret for not yelping before going to the dinner last night.If I could give negative 5 stars I would do it without a second thought. It was absolutely the worst customer service ever. Korean restaurants always provide lots of appetizers and refills when asked.  We asked for a refill for just 1 appetizer that we like for the 2nd time. At first we were ignored even though we pressed the bell at least twice. And then when a waiter came, we were given the response "no you can only have 1 refill" and some attitude as if we were begging. Mind you we had a table of 6 and ordered a dish each. It can easily win the worst Korean restaurant of all time if there was such a recognition. The price wasn't cheap either. I just wonder how they still manage to stay in business with servers who hated to work there and give attitudes to the customers as if we were causing troubles to them. All in all, we would not go back there again and would encourage everyon
3022;This particular location has totally gone downhill this year.  I went on a late Sunday night at around 9pm the last two times and the service was non-existent.    Why put a bell there if the servers don't even check the display board?  Took 15 minutes to flag down a server to order.  Gamjatang came but was way undercooked.  They missed our order of stewed beef broth so we had to wait 40 minutes.  When it came, there was no beef at all only the broth(They forgot to put the beef in....).  Took us another 15 minutes the flag down a server(the bell was useless).  I won't be coming to this location again for sure.
3023;We asked to refill some of our side dish. The waitress's response was "Later! later! we are too busy right now." In a tone that it's like we just asked for the most rediculous thing in the world, left and never came back. Oops sorry for making you busy, won't happen again! :) 1 star is for the food , but honestly you have way too many options in that area, try another Korean restaurant that actually has some service.
3024;The SO and I popped in here for lunch, primarily because of the banchan selection. Within moments I was wishing we had just stuck to Owl. (few doors down). Lunch was HORRIBLE. The Banchan (there was a huge selection) were ok but nothing special. The kimchi looked like it had been sitting there a while. We ordered off the lunch menu, which promised a "salad." The salad was literally 4 pieces of iceburg lettuce with a white dressing that was separating over the leaves.  My lunch was Chicken Bim bim Bap which was inedible. It was served cold in a white plastic bowl. The chicken was cooked maybe days earlier. The entire thing was slimy. The Korean man at table next to us also ordered  Bim Bim Bap and was presented a clay pot, piping hot. The server was downright BITCHY. Not one thank you, not a smile. Looked PISSED when we asked for banchan refills (so I wouldn't starve) The SO had Gamjatang which was also unremarkable. Never came to check on us.thankfully the bill was only $16 and the tea was good. This 
3025;I never write reviews for restaurants, but I just felt compelled to for this particular Nak Won location because out of all the terrible restaurants I've been to (and I've been to plenty of bad ones), this tops the list and beyond. Where do I begin? Horrible service, less than mediocre food and by far the most rudest, disrespectful and miserable-looking bunch of sorry excuses for servers I've ever had the displeasure of meeting (who even swore at my friends and I).       After watching a movie at the Cineplex theater nearby, my friends and I were hungry and were looking for a restaurant that was still opened so we could grab a quick bite. It was almost 10:30PM and we saw Nak Won was still opened so we figured we'd might as well just eat there. As we walked in, we were seated to a table for 3 and given a menu. Not even 2 minutes into looking at the menu and deciding what to order were we bombarded by an older waitress who approached us and asked if we were ready to order. We said "No, not yet." and she rudely
3026;Summary: Dirty and Bad ServiceI have been to this restaurant a few times but tonight, for sure, was the last time for me and my friends.  To start off, the appetizer they served was very dirty, it had a bug in the food.  And when we asked the waiters for bowls, they gave us dirty bowls (with kimchi sauce on it, for sure they didn't wash them thoroughly).  At when we finished our meal, the waitress immediately handed us the bill (which we didn't even ask for it).  We paid the bill and tipped them well, and my friends and I would like to sit there for 5-10 mins just to finish up our tea and wait for our rides.  However, right after they got our money, the waitress asked us to leave because they have other customers waiting.  We told the waitress that we want to sit there for another 5-10 mins cause we need to wait for our rides, then she walked away looking upset.  After another 1-2 mins, another waiter came to our table and asked us to leave again.  My friends and I were very upset at that point because we a
3027;There's lots of side dishes here and the menu is big compared to the average Korean restaurant. Good is quite yummy as well. That's about where all the good stuff ends. The service here is pretty bad. It's like pulling nails to get your cup refilled and since the food is salty or spicy, I really want to have some water with me at all times. My boyfriend asked two different waiters for a jug of water that never came. I don't know why they have a bell at the tables for if they are going to just ignore the ring. My bf even Jones that we could have just got up and left since they're trying so hard to ignore their customers.
3028;Before writing this review, I'd like to say that Ive given this restaurant multiple chances over the years. I am not usually someone who demands top of the line service. If anything, I only ask for service in order to place an order, maybe for a refill of water, and then for the bill.  I understand asian restaurants tend to be quick and blunt in order to get their customers in and out, but the staff here is just plain rude. I have come back once every year or so thinking that it has changed for the better, but it is as if they train the new staff to be just as rude as the previous staff. In addition to slow and rude service (and I mean SLOW. Takes about 10 minutes to even get someone's attention), I will list the multiple instances where my party and I were treated unkindly.- Waitress was shocked that we did not give a tip at the end and demanded that we do not leave without giving a tip. - When asking for refills on their side dishes, would be told that we don't need new dishes because we've finished our
3029;smelly restaurant, mediocore food with extremely bad service. first visit, they took ages to give us water and utensils for our food. we had to ask 2 different waitresses and they both said "1 minute" and never returned. second visit, the waitresses give us the same shitty treatment and this time i gave minimum tip(was strongly thinking of giving none), and the cashier gave me the dirtiest look. I'm not sorry for tipping you minimum.. at least i tipped you. both times we went during lunch time there weren't even much people in the restaurant. all in all, i would give this place no stars if i could.
3030;Over the year, I have tried this place. Their service remained the same, slow and sometimes rude.... When it comes to food, I am only giving 1 star because of their variety of small plate/snacks that comes for free. Food quality isn't consistent and their gamjantang seems like their soup is watered down/bland... cold noodle isn't that good compared to other Korean restaurant out there...Basically, for the price im paying in this restaurant is not the quality I am expecting when other restaurant are actually cheaper. Save your money and eat elsewhere... sorry Nak Won u really let me down.
3031;if there is zero or minus star i will definitely give it to them. We have been here for years. Now they change the owner, everything just can't be more worse. Food is bad, service is bad too. Don't recommend. And the fried beef, the beef is coming cold by smells. Omg terrible. And services are wiping floor when we come at 10. Bleach with food tasting. Perfect match
3032;Do yourself a favour and visit any other Korean restaurant at FMP. The only reason why you would come to this restaurant is if you're up for serving yourself. Though considering all stories about finding extra protein (a.k.a insects) in food, you might want to extend that reason to include self-cooking. I came here the first time with a friend to have an early dinner. We sat ourselves down (because no server came to seat us) and proceeded to press the button to call for waiter. What a surprise - it was broken. Thinking we were extremely clever, we pressed the button on the unoccupied table next to us. What a surprise - no waiter came. After waving foolishly for fifteen minutes, a disgruntled women came and took our orders begrudgingly. We had to beg her to give us tea and side dishes. We both ordered gamgatang, but what came to our tables appeared to be spicy water with a heap of skimpy bones. Trying to mask the lack of taste, the chefs evidently overspiced it, which called for the need of multiple glasses 
3033;The positive reviews for this place are absolutely astounding.I came here with a large party of people on a Sunday night. Something that, you would think, huge restaurants like Nak Won would be used to by now. They also fool you into thinking they have some sort of logical system of serving, with the electronic bells on the tables that I love. Yes, you can press them to your heart's content and even see your table number flashing on the giant LOST-like screen at the counter but your beeps will fall on deaf ears.... not once did the servers look up at the screen or even register that a bell was being pushed. Handwaving, dirty looks and even standing up to gesture to a server was to no avail. Aside from Magic Wok, who I would say share the dubious distinction of SLOWEST AND MOST INCOMPETENT WAIT STAFF IN MAKRHAM (C), Nak Won is the worst place in the universe to eat if you want to be treated like a normal, paying customer (and/or human being).It took literally 15 minutes to flag down a server to get a men
3034;If I can give NEGATIVE stars, I would not hesitate!HORRIBLE SERVICE -the server declined to give me an extra spoon. " NO, YOU CANNOT HAVE ONE" - that's exactly what she said to me in the rudest attitude possible. Seriously, I cannot understand why she would give us attitude for that.-Korean restaurants are famous for multiple little appetisers. This restaurant would not let you get repeats of the little dishes. I understand that there should be a limit to the number of times one can get refills. BUT we only wanted a 2nd round. " NO YOU CANNOT HAVE" - that is what the server said again. -I finally understand my they declined to give me a spoon when I saw what they did to wash their tea cups. I saw the server take some cups out of the dirty pile of dishes and wash it in a tub of water for less than 5secs and stacked them back up to serve to customers. DISGUSTING!!! I seriously want to report them to the Markham Health Inspection Board. (no wonder they don't want to give me a spoon, caz they don't want to
3035;Normally I wouldn't write a bad review but our experience was actually so bad it was funny. We have eaten there before (thus the *) and the food was decent so we decided to try again. 40 minutes after arriving we still hadn't received any tea, water, banchan or our order. We finally flagged down a waitress (you might have better luck finding a cab in NY), and asked her to check on our order. She went to check and never came back to tell us (?!) and went about doing her thing. We asked a second waitstaff who was courteous but he told us they gave our order to someone else so we just left for fear we might waste another 45 minutes.
3036;Their food was at good quality and up to my standards. But the customer service was like a JOKE! I have never been so mad about a restaurant service before. My girlfriend and I waited more than 10 mins just for water. The worst part was when we were paying for the bill. The total came up at $27.24. I was already nice enough to put down $30.00 and the rest as tips for the horrible service. The lady came up to me and said that there is not enough tip. I was in shock! She gave me a rude look and walked away. If you want to be treated like a dog, this is the place to go....
3037;ZERO STARS.  Quite possibly my worst dining experience ever.  It was mid afternoon and we just happened to be in the area.  There are many restaurants in this mall, mostly Chinese and a few Korean.  We picked this one based on the menu but in retrospect we should have eaten Chinese.We ordered: tuk kalbee which is supposed to be chicken thigh chunks, cabbage, duk (rice cake), carrots, perilla leaves and spicy sauce - all cooked in front of you at the table.  I have had this dish in Korea, Canada and at home, each time the formula remains the same with the odd variation from one place to the next.Our table was fired up and then our plate of "tuk kalbee" arrived.  It was actually: pre-cooked chicken breast slices in a red sauce with green and red peppers.  Me in English: what is this? Is that pre-cooked ?Are we table cooking or table reheating?My wife immediately translates to KoreanServer: that's how we do it here.Me: but this isn't tuk kalbee, this is pre-cooked chicken fajitas that we are now cooking
3038;Food was so-so. We ordered the all you can eat BBQ, we kept asking them to bring our 2nd round of food, it took them over 30 minutes to bring 2 plates of raw kalbi. How long does it take to prepare raw food? The waitress definitely forgot about it, more than once. Needless to say our 2 hour was up and we didn't even have a 3rd round of food. We both paid over $56 + tax of food and at the end we didn't even get a chance to eat our worth. Service was horrible, we tipped them with whatever the change came back with because got next-to-nothing service. At the end the waitress asked us to tip them 10% and when we didn't want to, she then said we need to respect her and made a scene in front of several other customers. Where was our, the customer's, respect? We left the place unhappy, and empty feeling.
3039;First and foremost, the service was terrible. The food was passable (we got the bibimbap and gamjatang), but the appetizers were flavorless. The waitress who served us seemed like she didn't want to be there, and every time we needed something it was like we were interrupting their conversation. When we asked for the bill, she ignored us to finish her conversation, making us wait. Complete lack of customer service. The most appalling part came after we paid the bill. I have no issue tipping, but it is something that is earned, not an entitlement. We felt our experience was poor and the tip reflected that. As we were leaving, the same waitress ran after us claiming we did not tip enough. When we started explaining why we didn't,  she walked away before we finished our sentence and said forget it.If you're at First Markham, do yourself a favour and go to Owl of Minerva. The food and service is much better there.
3040;One of the worse dining experience ever. If I could give -5 stars, I would. My group of friends and I walked in and got seated after 10 minutes of standing there even though it was not busy since we saw many empty tables. Once we sat down, we sat there for roughly 10 minutes. Usually we would have been given tea by now but nothing. I started to press the bell, (even though we could hear the bell ringing nonstop - assuming other tables were also ringing at the same time) - no waitresses came over. After 15 minutes, I waved my hands in disbelief hoping someone would just come over and write our orders because we were starving. But no one - even though 2 ladies made eye contact with me. After 20 minutes, I saw one waitress coming by my table and I BEGGED  " could you PLEASE write our orders" - she rolled eyes at me and yelled out HOLD ON angrily. (seems like it wasn't her job to do so) After 7 more minutes, my group of friends and I just walked out. They didn't even notice and probably didn't care.This is my 
3041;I usually don't write review but this time I have to express my discontent about this restaurant.  I haven't been to this place for more than a year but I never thought it would become this bad. I ordered a bibimbap which costed $8.99.  It came out and only with three thin slices of beef which is hiding below the fried egg.  I usually don't complain but I can't help myself not saying anything this time.  So I talked to a waitress who was young and she wouldn't do anything about it.  She simply just shook her head.  So my friend helped me to ask a more senior waitress to come and I showed her the three thin slices of beef and she had a few embarrassing laughters and then took the rice bowl back. She came back with the rice bowl with more beef.  I didn't know if they had added any 'special' ingredients in this rice bowl but I did not care anymore.  And guess what, I will NEVER and I mean NEVER come back!
3042;This place has a 2 star rating????  That's already overrated. We came here on a Saturday evening. Server sat us down and threw our place mat and utensils like ninja stars. A napkin nearly fell off. Oh and don't bother pressing the bell to get your server. It's not going to get their attention. We ordered a soon tofu,  LA kalbi, champong and japchae. The soon tofu came UNSEASONED. It was literally water and chili oil. We told our server about how bland it is and asked for salt. She merely responded with a "talk to the hand"  motion and left. I went to another table to grab the condiments myself. We even had to throw in the kimchi side dish into the soup to remedy it. Next up, the kalbi was BURNT, to say the least. If you like charcoal bits with your meat then I tell you they serve it here. The champong noodle was overcooked, like it's earwax in soup. For the japchae, they used skimpy thin noodles, and the size is not what it's worth. Unsatisfied with their service,  (they never even refilled our tea once) we
3043;Roaches and bad service - what more can i say? I came in because I had a craving for pork bone soup. We ordered our food, it came, then the server was no where to be found. As my friend proceeded to pay at the counter, I saw a bug crawl out from the middle serving station and up a table leg. Upon watching it crawl across the floor and up a table leg for 2 minutes, completely shocked, and disgusted, I realized it was a roach. They were pretty lucky it was 2:30 PM on a Sunday and no one else was there to see this.
3044;Distinctively terrible, mostly due to the nonexistent service.I came here with a group of friends. We were seated at the table and then completely ignored for about 25 minutes, nobody came to ask us if we wanted tea or anything. They gave us menus and blank slips of paper and expected us to write down what we wanted. The waitresses would not come to the table at all unless we rang the bell for service. Since I don't actually like Korean food all that much but my friends do, I tried to order some more Western dishes like spring rolls, dumplings and meat skewers, only to be told that each of them was unavailable. I tried a couple more things before giving up and just asking for a bowl of plain rice. At the end of all this, they were very rude and annoyed when we asked for separate checks.
3045;This place has the absolute worst service I had ever seen! The waitresses were rude and short-tempered the moment we walked into the door. Every time we tried to call one of them, they would tell us it was not their job to get stuff for us and we had to wait for our specific server. We seriously contemplated not giving any tips at all but we left the regular 10% and the waitresses had the gall to chase us out the door complaining and SWEARING AT US! What the hell kind of place is this?!The food was average at best. There was a super irritating door bell going off every few minutes (it might have been the buzzers on the table, which was broken on ours). Overall, a horrendous experience. It would have been cheaper and tastier to go into the food court and order from the Korean food stall there instead of this sh*tty "restaurant". Save yourself from horrid waitstaff and DO NOT EAT HERE!
3046;please stay away from this restaurant:1) Horrible service as if customer is a burden. Server was rude and unclear to where she'd sit us she rolled her eyes at us and left us standing and guessing where our table was. 2) Waited 15 minutes for someone to take our order even though we pushed the server button. First thing she said when she came to our table: "you didn't have to push the button..." 3) Cleanliness of the kitchen is EXTREMELY questionable as customer found a nail-size insect in their pork bone soup! Doesn't seem like a big deal for servers. It's a surprise to me that they are still surviving. But definitely have a sense that they are losing business as compared to before.  Truly hope their owner will care about their customers a little more...
3047;This place used to be the go to place whenever I feel like having Korean food. But tonight's visit told me that it's time to go somewhere else.I never had a problem with the service but tonight, I experienced the awful service that other reviewers here have posted.The waitresses were rude from beginning to end. We were told to write our order on a piece of paper but we weren't provided a pen or paper. Today was one of the hottest days. We had a party of 9 and only 1 bottle of cold water. Of course we would empty the bottle quite quickly and was asking the waitresses multiple times for a new bottle. We were ignored, one of them gave us the look as she passed by.Not much to say about the food. It's the same for people who have visited before. Though the potato in my pork bone soup was a bit under cooked.The service isn't worth the time or money. I will no longer visit this restaurant.
3048;I have been to many Nak Won restaurants across the Greater Toronto Area, but this location at First Markham Place has to be the WORST. I've been to this location for many years but I realized that their service and food is going downhill. Also, I think this place is way too understaffed for a Saturday night. To start off, we got seated quickly and the waitress threw the menus onto the table... okay.. not off to a good start. Many waitresses walked by us with no smiles and didn't even bother glancing at our table. Didn't even bother asking if we wanted to order yet, also didn't give us any utensils/tea. Took them 20 minutes to actually come and take our order. We even had to request for tea and utensils. The food came within a reasonable time (I give them one star for that) but the food was okay. Eh, you can get better Korean food elsewhere. When we wanted to get the bill, for some reason, they brought the bill over really quickly. No one came to get our payment, so I decided to go up to the counter to 
3049;We order pickup from this place periodically. It's average at best but there really aren't any great Chinese food places nearby. I like the egg rolls and soup. Tonight we ordered soup, egg rolls, black bean chicken, shanghai noodles, and crispy ginger beef. Noodles were bland, chicken was slimy, and there was a STAPLE IN MY BEEF (see picture). It was not sitting on top but embedded inside the beef. How does that even happen?? I could have been feeding this to my child - or I could have swallowed it and have it perforated my organs!The owner apologized and offered us a free crispy beef next time. Not that I plan on ordering from there again but that's the kind of offer you make if someone finds hair in their food...not when they find something that could have seriously injured them! Will never order from there again. I can see from the reviews on here that they seem to have an issue with metal items and bugs being found in their food.
3050;I ordered food through the Just Eat app, where this restaurant overwhelmingly scored 5/6 stars. I wish I had read more reviews before I ordered. This was the worst Chinese food we have ever had. Every dish was bland and soggy. We moved to Toronto from Halifax- the whitest place in Canada- and had better Chinese food there. Completely disappointing.
3051;New definition of bland! In a blind taste test, one would not be able to distinguish between the chow mein, chop suey, or beef teriyaki. All the food we ordered was lacking flavour. The ribs were surprisingly monstrous, but not in a good way. They looked like they came from a brontosaurus. Service was great, as we were the only ones in the restaurant. Close attention but not smothering. Although the 20% off was helpful, we wouldn't come back.
3052;On a positive note I didn't find any non-food object in my food but that's where the positivity basically stops.I wish I had gone somewhere else, somewhere that can get the basics (like steamed rice) right. I'll start with what was decent. The chicken fried rice was actually palatable, it had a smoky taste to it but that brought it a unique flavour that made you want more.In the indifferent category was the chicken chow mein. Well cooked, granted I'm not sure what one is aiming for when making chow mein, and obviously fresh chicken.Then. Where it all went wrong. Steamed rice. How do you get this wrong? Not only wrong but awful. It was dry and hard and resembled the rice I used to eat in university when I left cooked rice out for two days. Add to that a soggy egg roll or two and you have our experience.
3053;Just ordered online from this restaurant and my boyfriend and i had the chicken chop suey. He took a bite of it and he found a long metal string mixed into it. Disgusting.
3054;Bland, slick, goey and wrong. Ordered $27 of food and threw out most of it.The mixed vegetables with cashews were crisp but came in what can only be described as "grease-water." Very bland and very slick to the touch. Had to rinse them off to make them edible.The Chicken and Mushroom (Moo Koo Gai Pan) was also very bland and the chicken had lots of gooey bits hanging off it. It left me feel a bit quesy from the texture and the grease. The Tom Yam Gai soup was a total fail. Tasted like fishy hot sauce and salt in water - and this is a dish I frequently order. The one at Spring Rolls is so much better - they cannot even compare.  VERY disappointed. Delivery took 1 hour, as well - way too long!
3055;I ordered from here recently and was not impressed. First of all, I was told that delivery would take 45-55 mins or sooner, my order did not arrive until 1.5 hours later. My food was cold, slimy, and bad quality. And to top it off, I found a bug in my food. Will not be ordering from here again. Overpriced.
3056;Zero stars should be available. The driver withheld my food because I did not put a tip on the receipt. I had to demand my food from him twice. I showed him it was paid for. He told me yes, but no tip! I showed him the 2 twoonies in my hand I had to give him. He reached for the $4. I held it back and took my food and did not give him the $4. He then called me a "f--king b--ch". I called and complained. The manager was also rude but eventually apologized, when I said I would call Just-Eat and complain. He also said he would give me a $5 credit for next time. Next time? NEVER me again! I don't know if there food is good because after the bad taste in my mouth from the abuse I received at the door, I couldn't eat. BTW, their Cantonese Chow Mein is made with 2 bricks of Ramen dropped in the bottom of a container with the veg and meat on top. You have to break up the Ramen and remove the hard lumps that didn't soften. Horrible!
3057;Service OK on the slow side. Food was horrible, almost like everything was from frozen, no taste. Not very clean, weird smell in the air. Wouldn't go back
3058;I used to go to this pub for 2 years with my sports team. Friendly atmosphere, reasonable. Priced food. Not great, but ok. I went with friends for lunch, only to see a cochroach walking on the ledge. When I mentioned it to a waitress she mentioned they have been dealing with them for 3 years. And when ever they fumigate and spray they come back. We left and wont be returning anymore.
3059;Appalling! We couldn't get into Local across the street, so went in on a whim. Don't let the updated exterior fool you. It's the same old dark & dingy place, reaking of spilled beer. There were families, eldery couples, middle-aged like us from the neighbourhood. Waitress said that everything was 'awesome' after each order. Well, it truly was not awesome. She said the bartender made the best Cosmo she had ever had - bleh - sickly sweet, no lime. Nothing on the menu appealed to us - same old, same old pub staples, cooked from frozen. We opted for  a couple of the specials. Ribs & wings for my husband, with fries so salty they were inedible. Ribs were grey, no flavour, with BBQ sauce spread on top (Kraft no doubt). I ordered the pork stir fry special. The pork was cooked beyond recognition - yesterday's leftovers I think - a glob of noodles, with teriyaki sauce from a jar, and nary a vegetable to be found. The chef should be embarassed to serve food like that. We can seriously say we will never, ever eat there 
3060;We arrived at the pub on a sunny weekday in July hoping to have lunch on the patio, but we were told it was closed because of construction. Sitting inside was pretty dark and not overly welcoming. We were pretty annoyed that when we were just about done our meal a few other people asked to be seated on the patio, for some reason the patio was magically no longer under construction. I can understand if they had it closed because they didn't have the staff to cover it, but don't lie and then open it for others.The menu looked like standard pub fare and they had some specials. It was a little pricey, but we figured it must be decent. The food was immensely disappointing, not much flavour, and it tasted cheaply and quickly prepared. The food was what you would expect to find in a cafeteria or worse. I wouldn't be surprised if it was microwaved. We left there feeling like we paid typical Toronto prices for hospital food.The waiter we had was nice and responsive, but it wasn't enough to leave us with anything b
3061;Been to this location twice.  It appears the location is being run by young twenty something girls who enjoy gossiping with each other while taking your order.  I got the hot chicken with mushrooms, with side olives.  The bread was stale, they gave me one tiny piece of chicken and the mushrooms were cold.  Not to mention is was thrown together so quickly that the bottom was covered with sauce.  Olives were old and drenched with oil.  Will never be back.  It's a shame because the location on Dixie delivers a far superior product.
3062;This is the worst customer service I've ever seen in the food industry . Someone needs to teach the employees how to treat the customers who are paying their wages .long time customer and won't be back
3063;The young blonde woman who served me at the cash register the past couple of times really needs to learn a thing or two about customer service. I'm not quite sure who this 'princess' thinks she is, but I've never encountered such a phony. Her insincere smile is about as genuine as her hair colour with the expression on her face fading back to indifference as soon as customers backs are turned. It's quite apparent that this individual feels as though she's above everyone she serves. As a minimum wage employee working at a Mississauga  sandwich shop, of course she is. What was I thinking? The fries are terrible too. Would give zero stars if at all possible.
3064;Wow what bad service!! The girl at the counter very rude to me as well as the poor lady in front of me..when I asked her if I can get one sandwich a bit spicy she pointed her finger to the back over her right shoulder while looking right passed me. Took me while but I realized she was pointing to the menus!! Hahahaha felt like I was disturbing her by spending $20+ of my money on two sandwiches!! So sorry that I came to this place..service counts a ton
3065;Food at this location is well below average as far as other California Sandwiches go. And the icing on the cake is the rude female cashier with ugly spotted tattoos all over her neck. Left me standing at the register over 5 minutes while she's just giggling and gossiping with her coworkers instead of taking my order. Will definitely not return and don't recommend at all.
3066;this became the worst sandwich restaurant in mississauga. i tried this place 5 years ago and they were awesome. now they are the worse. sandwich is large bread full of nothing. the meat they are using has no taste. do not go there.
3067;I personally will never eat at this place ever again. I ate a meatball sandwhich and I couldn't eat more than 6 bites without gulping down something to drink to wash down the taste. In the end I was debating whether to ask for a refund because it was like $14.00 or something like that and I ended up throwing away more than half. I don't consider myself a very picky eater and I'll usually eat almost anything... but this was flat out disgusting. When I came home and told my mum that I ate there she said "Ohhh you didn't get the meatball sandwhich did you"... Maybe similar taste buds got transferred genetically there... Either way thats 2 reviews in a nutshell. Maybe I'm coming across a little harsh since I really only tried the one meal there... my girlfriend had the veil and she said she liked hers. Nevertheless, I will never eat there again and if you decide to, Don't get the meatball sandwhich.
3068;Had a steak sandwich for take-out the other day and was extremely disappointed. The meat was not fresh, it had a very overwhelming smell as if it was expired. I've had a couple of bad experiences with this location but still had given it a chance but not anymore.  If you want to avoid getting sick, skip this place.  You will waste your money and time.
3069;Used to be a great joint to grab an Italian sandwich.  Has gone downhill since its opening. The girls behind the counter NEVER smile...and while they aren't rude, they certainly aren't friendly. I've stopped going here altogether because of the service. It's a shame too bc I've been a regular of this location as well as the Etobicoke one.Smile girls! If you hate your job that much do something else.
3070;This is the worst location of this chain. High turn over of staff who usually have no idea what they're doing or selling.
3071;Came here with the family and none of us have experiences such a terrible restaurant. I do not recommend it to anyone- they are very inexperienced & food is absolutely tasteless-We asked for a gyro plate and litterly got a plate of gyro strips, no veggies no sauce or anything and just bread to make it a sandwich on our own without anything else. - the hummus was dry and was obviously just taken out of a can  and completely flavourless- we even had to ask her to add oil on top of the hummus. - the falafel tasted like it's been out for days and it was hard and tasted terrible. - the soup is terrible as well they destroyed the concept of Mediterranean food completely ... if your in the area just don't eat there & save your money!
3072;I just had my first shawarma, and I was so disappointed of the food and service.My background is Turkish and I know the real deal.1.The meat wasn't a fresh cut. The beef oven was turned off and they reheated a piece of meet and cut them into small pieces.2. The service was friendly but inexperienced and very slow.3. The shawarma was very cold.4. I paid for this shawarma $9 and after my second bite I trowed it into the garbage.My suggestion is stay away and find an other place to eat. I'm 100% sure they won't last more than 6 months.
3073;The food was delivered cold and it took 1h40 mins. My wrap was made completely wrong and full of hot peppers to the point where I couldn't even eat it. The ONLY thing that was good was the falafel, but again. Cold falafel can only be so good.
3074;I was craving a falafel on my way home and decided to try this place. Located on the north side of College Street, in what is essentially a row of restaurants, it is a typical shawarma place. There a lot of tables facing the street and then the counter in the back corner with the grill and dryer behind that. Had falafel that was overpriced at $ 8.00 and over salted. If you are going to sell food to the public, taste it before you sell it. I threw most of it out because it was inedible. Before you sell something do your market research and find out the prices of your competitors. $ 8.00 is crazy for a falafel sandwich. With food and prices like this they won't be around long.
3075;Absolutley nothing to rave about here. The crust is dry and heavy and their sauce is way too salty. Too bad because I was really hoping to have fiund a local pizza joint close to home that makes delish pizzas. The search continues as I am now way out of the delivery range of my fave delivery pizza joint - King Slice.
3076;We have lived in this area for 25 years. We have always ordered from Diamond's but in the last few years we have ordered less and less as the quality of food is getting worse. We ordered a home burger which is one of the few good things still left. We also ordered the haddock and fries and a caesar salad. When the fish arrived my jaw dropped. It looked like a burnt pop tart. We received ONE piece of fish with our order. And we didn't get tartar sauce. When I called the restaurant I was advised the tartar sauce is only given "on request" - which we did request. They also confirmed they always only serve one piece of fish. The fish was as long and as thin as an iPhone 5. It tasted like a frozen fish stick. This was by far the worst order I've had for delivery from any restaurant. The restaurant expected us to wait for the next driver to return to be able to have the sauce sent out... Diamond's is literally one block from our house. Overpriced and poor quality. Beware when ordering...
3077;There are way too many other options for ordering pizza to choose this place again. My pizza must have been sideways en route because it arrived with all of the cheese bunched on one side and soggy dough on the other. The cheese wasn't even fully melted. How hard is it for a pizza restaurant to make a pizza?!
3078;First time I ordered from this pizza restaurant. The food was awful. The calzone was deep fried with the meat sauce on the side???? First time, last time.
3079;Use to be an amazing place both to order in or take out. Went there today and was terribly disappointed. The floors under the counter were disgusting. Looked like they hadn't moved the gum machine to clean. Actually liked like some food stuffs were  on the floor. It is a shame because they used to have the best food. I asked to use the washroom while waited for my order. I was told it was an employee only washroom. Seriously? It wasn't like I walked on off the street wanting to use their bathroom. Food was mediocre at best . Parking lot needed to be salted or sanded. Won't be back
3080;Stay away. The food is badly overpriced. I ordered a steak medium rare. It can well done. I sent it back and the new one came almost well done. I guess they don't like to serve any pink in their steaks. It was like eating rubber. Not an enjoyable experience. Stay away.
3081;Let's just say it took forever to get dinner we didn't get a glass of water... Horrible horrible services had about 6 ppl serving us.. Never again
3082;I expected so much more for Kelsey's. It was my first time there and had ordered the chicken tenders coated with Doritos. Worst mistake I made, ended up getting so sick. And the price was rather high.
3083;My boyfriend and I have been sitting here for more than 45mins and none of my order showed up. So I asked the waiter, he is the MOST HORRIBLE waiter I've ever seen. I wasn't impolite, I was just asking, and he was like, it was not my fault, it's the cook's responsibility, I did my best. And gave me an attitude which surprised me a lot.  If the manager is reading this, please fire this waiter. Check your schedule for June 26, he was the one took care the right hand section. We were sitting at a booth at the very end.
3084;Service when there is more than 3 people in the restaurant is atrocious, would not recommend coming during any function in Scarborough, go to Boston pizza down the street!
3085;Sad to give such a low rating because... We didn't even order food! We left before our glasses of water reached us, which is sad. Got to restaurant and waited to be seated. No one greeted us for about 10 minutes. The restaurant is relatively dead, no one was in the bar area (not even a bartender was there). When we finally got seated we just asked for water first. After another 10 minutes of waiting to get our glasses of water and to place our order, we just decided to leave. And when we were putting on our coats to leave, the server finally came over and said water is still on the way! Are you pumping fresh water from somewhere?! Honestly, no one should wait 10 minutes for water in any restaurant... Busy or dead. Another reason why we left is there wasn't anything on the menu that we wanted enough. Why pay $20 for a plain burger that you don't really want to eat?! I didn't want to settle for something on the menu for the sake of eating there. I never got up and left before but I'm really glad we did. It
3086;TERRIBLE! I wasn't feeling well and decided to get some Chicken Noodle Soup and a small bun... DISAPPOINTED  when I got back to my desk and saw what looked like boiled water, few noodles and tons of celery. THIS IS NOT CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP - will never be back. The staff is not friendly and slid my bag to me at checkout... customer service lacks as much as the soup does.
3087;food is just pure dog shit makes me wanna vomit, their chicken are stinky and some spicy dishes are ridiculously sweet that you can even taste the sugar in your mouth this is not Chinese food or not even food for human beings so if you wanna waste 30 dollars on some dog shit and flirt some Chinese international student then come to sichuanren
3088;Horrible!! I ordered the ma pao tofu rice and braised pork noodles soup. Both were covered in a very thick layer of oil and they both taste horrible.  I couldnt even feel my mouth after a few bite.  Will never come back!
3089;I ordered Pork and rice from the menu, it was a take away and when I got home to eat my meal found a disgusting pile of pure fat! No meat whatsoever to be found. This is misleading from their menu. I called the restaurant and I was told its indeed pork belly but its not specified in the menu.Totally a waste of money since I bought two meals. I also told them no egg and they added a fried egg to both of my meals. There is also a huge communication barrier.
3090;1.5 stars! I really wanted to give this place a chance as I really like braised beef noodle soup and since Asian Legend recently closed in the area, I have a limited number of choices for beef noodle soup.I called at around 5pm and a woman answered with "Hello?" so I requested to make a pick-up order. The girl on the other line immediately stated "This is not the Thai restaurant." I stated, "Yes, I know. It's Sichuan Ren." She then went on to say "We don't do delivery." I told her that it was okay because I planned to pick it up. I proceeded with my order of two braised beef noodle soups, setting aside the odd telephone manner. Two minutes later, I get a call back and the girl tells me that they are "out of beef noodle soup." Whaaa? Anyway, they told me that I'd have to wait 30 minutes for my order. I gave them a chance and agreed to it.Thirty minutes later, I went to the restaurant to pick up my order. Apparently, for takeout orders, they put the noodles and the soup in the same container! For those who 
3091;I went with my friend and ordered beef soup. It was way to salty that it literally was not meant for people to eat. I asked to remake the soup to be less salty so I can actually eat! (Im usually very good with salty and spicy food) the waitress came back with my food, and I took one sip of the soup and decided to leave bc it tasted like they added more water to the soup and it was still extremely salty. I have never been to a place where they serve food that people cant eat.. It was a horrible experience
3092;Complete disorganization behind the counter. I ordered the pepperoni slice and waited in line to pay. Once i paid, i had to stand off to the side and wait for them to take my slice out of the oven. When it finally came out the guy called out the pepperoni slice and i went to grab it, but he gave it to the woman paying who grabbed it before i could say anything and then the cashier looked up at me and asked me what slice i got. I told him Peppeoni, and he rung it into the cash register. I had to tell him that i had already paid and he had rung me thru about 2 minutes ago and the previous lady pretty much took my slice. After way too much time and hassle, i finally got my slice. I like the brand, but i will hesitate to visit this location again. This place needs much better management.
3093;Nazi Server won't let you sit and eat ten minutes before closing. Why?Listen, I'm a big guy and I can eat one scrawny slice in five flat. I don't linger. Telling me I can't stay when the big hand on the clock says the place is open for ten minutes is ludicrous. Saying this rudely without reason. And I'd already paid. And the pizza definitely wasn't good enough to be worth coming back, making this definitely the worst Pizzaiolo in Toronto for service if not for food as well.So let's forget this little sociopathic wannabe-dictator, and give this location a pass because it doesn't deserve our business.
3094;the old guy behind the counter is  extremely rude.  doesn't acknowledge when you are talking to him and when you repeat yourself acts like you have committed a grave sin.
3095;Will never go back. Rude service and only had 4 pizzas left to choose from. Felt like I was in line for food at a prison the way they were speaking to their customers.
3096;Pizza is good but the service is horrible. I mean you actually feel offended it is that rude.  I came here a year ago, the manager was rude then so I didn't return. After a year went back for a slice and yeah its the same rude service.  Never again.
3097;The cashier was pleasant - but the amount of beef I got with a Styrofoam container of bleached noodles was pathetic.  There was SO LITTLE meat that I made the mistake of going back to buy a separate order of chicken.BIG MISTAKE.10 hours after I ate their bland food - I woke with a feeling of lead in my stomach.  Then I spent much of the next hour on the toilet.I don't want to gross you out - but liquid was spewing out of me like a fire hose for many visits during a very unpleasant hour.I felt nauseous - but the explosion from where you shouldn't explode from was the worst.DON'T make the mistake I made of eating from this place.You've been warned.
3098;Yuck! Yuck! Yuck! *spew*Wow this place is awesome... at making their food look like it has the potential to actually be tasty. It is absolutely disgusting. I can't even describe it. I got some chicken dish and it was so overly sweet it wasn't even enjoyable.Discounting the fact that they fill 80% of your plate with plain white rice this place wouldn't be worth the money even if they loaded your plate up with whatever you actually ordered. I paid $11 for a terrible meal and a drink. The food was so bad I opted to toss it in the garbage rather than finish it for the sake of not wasting $11.In the end I was glad to have so much white rice, I pushed all the other food aside and ate the rice since it was more enjoyable then trying to stomach the other crap.Don't waste your money (or time) here.
3099;Just got my food from this place. It is inedible. Chicken not cooked. Vegetables not cut. It is like everyone there has given up on life. I would give it negative points if I could. -10000000
3100;This is my first yelp review as I am compelled to give one so either the restaurant was really good or really bad.I don't have any complaints about the service, it was okay.  The lady who had served me was pleasant but in a rush.I had the Orange chicken stired with vegetables and rice and it was terrible.  The rice was bland and the vegetables too oily.  The broccoli lost its color either because it was burnt or it was stale.  The chicken was way too sweet.  I am a guy who has a sweet tooth but this is something that I couldn't handle.  I can't believe I had to throw a chicken because it was too sweet.It was a waste of money and an assault on my taste buds.
3101;This place should be closed down by the Health Department as on Friday I came back from a trip and wanted to get something to eat before I went home. Went and placed an order and for some odd reason they decided to serve people before I got serve even though I was first in the line to place an order.I won't mention what I had but lets just say it was not 100% what I ordered. That was my first mistake and 2nd mistake was eating it cause after a while I felt like someone punched me in my stomach and it started making some noises. I went into the washroom and let it all out. They either placed something in my food as it was exactly what I ordered. I should've went back and told them its not what I ordered but I ate it anyway.I will not ever eat here and as you can see others are giving bad reviews and you should stay away from this place. You might even get so sick you may need to go to a Hospital.
3102;Can I give zero stars? I had to THROW my Pad Thai away - and I'm usually not picky with my food. Bland, colorless, a total disgrace. Only reason I didn't go back to yell at them is because it was absolutely packed and I was pretty sure they wouldnt pay me back anyways.The definitely ' Fusia'd' me over and they will 'Fusia' you over too...STAY AWAY!
3103;I rated this One Star, but I meant One NEGATIVE star!!I eat to the occasion, hence I am not picky when it is to fill my tummy but I've eaten a good restaurants as well.Yesterday I was running late and only had time to grab a quick bite.  Went down to the food court at Atrium-on-the-Bay and ordered their $5.99 special - General Tao Chicken on Fried Rice and a can of pop.Portion was huge (much more than I normally eat) but the quality was horrible.  The fried rice was simply soy sauce tinted rice without any flavours (as I have said, I am not picky ... so the mushy texture and the lack of "fried"ness was something I fully expect in a food court).  But one has to draw the line with flavours ... there were none other than the faint hint of soy sauce.The chicken bits were tiny shreded bits heavily battered and deep fried.  I suspect they just hewn away at some leftover chicken from the day before, battered it thick and fried it.  The meat was dry, chewy and fibrous with no taste.  The sauce was a dark swee
3104;I ordered the kebab laffa.  I have never known a restaurant who was able to suck all the flavour out of meat.  In addition, the laffa was really a large, stale pita.  I sent it back and then ordered the cigars.  They came hot (good), greasy (not good), on a bed of lettuce (why?) and the meat seemed mealy, although well flavored.   There were a few positives: the pickles they bring to start are nice (would have been nicer if they refilled it), and the service was quick and pleasant.
3105;Probably the most disgusting food I've literally ever had. My husband and I both ordered shawarma laffa, took two bites of the stale and cold torpedos, and spit out our food right away. I'm shocked this place is even still in business. I will NEVER eat here again.
3106;Horrible customer service...had to wait 10 minutes For someone to come to the front to greet me on a Wednesday night! Only to be offered the worst table in the most crowded section and when I objected, the waitress seemed upset to offer another one...Server wasn't attentive while taking orders....dessert I ordered wasn't available but I wasn't informed until he brought the other dessert orders with two tiramisu shots (instead of the cake which I originally ordered). I felt like being put on the spot! I agreed to the substitute but one of the shots seemed like it was sitting outside the fridge for a while! In short, won't go back!
3107;We were here for our sister's birthday a few months back and we arrived at around 6 pm. There were no line up at the door, when we arrived. Everything were ok at best until we were eating our entree, first of all, the servers didn't get our plate to the right person, so we have to play a round of roulette, then we noticed that the servers and hosts were cycling our table non stop, and as soon as we put down our fork, someone will rushed over and took the plates away, I don't even remember if I had finish my plate or not. The best part was the server asked couple of the guests if they need a take out container while they were still chewing their food. I thought there must be a long line up at the door, even so, this is not acceptable. Food were average, service were terrible, paid over $150 for 5 to feel being rushed. We left at 7:30 pm and no one were at the door. Sent a complaint to head office, never get any follow up. We will never go back to Pickle Barrel.
3108;Extremely poor service.I've visited this Pickle Barrel hoping that after many tries their customer service would improve but to my dismay, it hasn't. Regardless where I've been seated (patio, front of restaurant, back of restaurant, bar) the greeting and service has been poor. I've been left waiting about 15-20 minutes before a server arrives, introducing themselves and offering to get a drink. By this time, my friends and I usually order our food right off the hop due to the wait. Food comes out hot and tasty, nothing to complain about there. It's just the waiting at the beginning which really plays a huge part in making me want to return. Due to this same experience time after time, I will no longer be going to this location, period. I was hoping it was a hiccup in opening the business a few years back but the same crappy wait times have continued with no resolve. Thanks, but no thanks.
3109;Went there tonight with my boyfriend and it was terrible. Waited 25 minutes for a glass of wine then decided to leave obviously..went downtown to ground burger bar and had way better service. Our server was so aggressive and rude it made us so uncomfortable. He was fighting with the table in front of us. I was a server for many years I understand how hard it is but honesty this guy was the worst he was so mad and punished us for his bad day we honestly felt so uncomfortable we couldn't get out soon enough.
3110;Went once, never again. Service was not friendly. Service was extremely slow. Once we got our food, about half had to be sent back because it was stone cold. We had to constantly look for our server, or ask other servers, to find her, so we could get drinks. She walked right past us about 5 times as we tried to get her attention... If felt like she was purposely ignoring us. After dinner, we got sticker shock. Entire experience, was not anywhere near what the charged us on the bill. Wish I could give zero stars
3111;No stars! Very disappointing take out service. Not enough competent staff, beef was stringy, potatoes had onions tho I expressly requested none. Won't be back ever!
3112;What happened to this GREAT brand!? Such a shame..I remember a time when someone mentioned the Pickle Barrel and my mouth would water...now I think yuk!
3113;I was really unhappy with my recent experience at Pickle Barrel. It was my first time at the Newmarket location and I was left very disappointed. We came on a busy day for lunch and we were seated at a table with almost no space between us and the next table. This made it impossible to have a private conversation and made us very uncomfortable. Apparently there were no other tables available. The table was also right beside a busy walkway which was not preferable. So right away the seating was not a great start. Our waitress - let's call her Judy - was trying her best to be friendly and patient despite the busy lunch hour but it was clear her patience was wearing thin and she was rushed. We ordered our meals and when they finally arrived, they did not come how we had asked. My friend had requested no tomatoes on her sandwich and I received the wrong dressing. The service was taking longer than expected so we decided to eat what we were given and get on with our day. My friend had her 6 month old baby with her
3114;I've been to this Pickle Barrel three times trying to give it a chance. My mistake. Portions small and not carefully prepared and prices high. Service is better at a drive thru. On two occasions our server disappeared and we had to get another server to go look for her/him. Not impressed at all and will not go back.
3115;On Saturday December ,10,2016 I visited the pickle barrel  for the first time my breakfast that I ordered was really horrible the eggs were cold and The toast was not toasted and the bacon was only one strip of bacon I will not be back and I will tell all my friends I am so upset about the first time. I evencontacted the pickle bill on the Internet and they said that if I could have the receipt the copy of the receipt I don't have the receipt my friend paid for it  but I will not be back.
3116;The last few times we've come to the PB, we have continued to enjoy the food, but how awful the service has been. Deplorable comes to mind. Be careful not to get on the bad side of the woman bartender, she's been brutal our last three visits. Rude. Arrogant. Flippant. Intentionally removed and absent. Remarks under her breathe. This is our last time here. Wow...
3117;Was good a couple years ago, now the value for money is gone. The quality and amount of food served is pathetic, what once was a 6" tall sandwich is a 3" tiny thing and the prices have gone up across the entire menu. What was a thick juicy steak, is thin and helplessly bad. The staff are actually great, it's simply greedy ownership/shareholders trying to squeeze more profit out of every menu item. Want a nice juicy thick steak, go elsewhere. Want a serious meal that will leave you satisfied and looking forward to the next time you can come back, doesn't exist at the pickle barrel... Well, not anymore at least.I will never go back, ever.
3118;As a regular as this establishment, my father has been coming to this location since it opened several years ago. So it was a surprise for me to hear the following as I write my super negative review. If you want a nice peaceful meal without being verbally assaulted with false accusations by the wait staff, unfortunately this is no longer the place to come. Negative stars big time as I listen to the story of the crazy waitress verbally assault and make false accusations of my father. A waitress that he has never seen nor dealt with prior to this embarrassing assault in front of other patrons. She threatened police action if he were to go back, he one upped he and offered that the police come now. If they had anything substantial to back their crazy accusations, why didn't they call the police? Because they have just lost a regular patron due to a looney toon waitress. He has been a regular at this establishment since it opened without issue, and is friendly with the rest of the wait staff, unfortunately t
3119;I so want to like this place but it disappoints every time. The food is poor quality. I've been here several times and continue to be unimpressed. The kids like it - that's why I keep coming back - but I'd rather punch myself in the face than come back here again. Small portions. Crappy quality to the food. Service is terrible and slow. Always feel like we are bothering them. Our waiter actually complained that he wasn't supposed to be working today and was upset that he was. Awesome!  There are lots of decent options in aurora and Newmarket. You don't need this one.
3120;Realistically the management of this place needs to have a better handle on their employees. Tonight the server we had must have been either brand new or just plain lazy. Not until we asked for the table to be cleared was it, there was dirty plates and cups piling up. I actually had to start stacking them up to make room for or main course. The cutlery was, in my opinion deplorable, they all looked to be dirty but upon a more thorough inspection it was just heavily water marked. The food at best is mediocre, however, it was the best part of the evening. Being there for a birthday party you would assume a dessert on the house would be in order yet nothing was provided. I'm not saying its necessary but some acknowledgment would have been respectful. Finally, the server was anything but hygienic, the odor emitting from her was repulsive, I lost my appetite.
3121;Ordered online for delivery to my hotel and this Domino's was the "caretaker" since it was the closest at just under a km away. According to the tracker, the pizza was out for delivery at 9:11 and marked as "delivered" at 9:20. Unfortunately, I was in the lobby waiting at 9:20 and no pizza was there. By 9:30 I called the store to find out details on the delivery. Person on phone said it would be there in 10-15 minutes. It showed up 5 minutes later and was barely luke warm. No apologies from the driver. Further, no napkins or plates or plasticware were included even though they knew they were delivering to a hotel. Pizza fine other than being barely warm.
3122;Worst service. Pizza delivery took 2 hours. Was wrong. Took another hour to correct and send out. Pizza had no cheese. This location is the ultimate failure.
3123;I ordered a cheese pizza and This is what I was given and they blatantly told me it wasn't burnt. Please what do you call this? (See attached photo)
3124;Ordered an extra cheese. Pepperoni/ chicken pineapple pizza. Pizza arrived 15 minutes late. And not only that. There was so few toppings on it. Literally a few pieces of chicken and pineapple.  Never again ordering from here .
3125;This place is disappointing for a brand new franchise. You would think after investing all that money they would want to hit it out of the park. The quality of the ingredients is sub-par but worse than you would except from a Domino's. I ordered the thin crust pizza and it came out like a giant cracker. Possibly one of the worst pizzas I've ever had. Zero reason to return or order from here again.
3126;Ok so here was my order.1 large pizza three toppings1 cheesy bread with marinara dipping sauce2 garlic sauces Absolutely terrible service here! Pizza came cold. And was over cooked. Order was wrong not once but twice. They forgot the marinara. Best part was when I called in and told them the error they promised to have a new one out in a bit which was another hour. It came ice cold and once again they delivered to me (after I called in and numerous times explained why I need the marinara sauce) two garlic sauces. It's frustrating knowing the person they hired to take orders has no idea how to listen. Honestly will not ever order from this dominos again. Too hard to get what I want and there's zero quality control I guess.  Try calling another dominos if you need some good food.
3127;salty, greasy pizza with clueless staff. This desi lady told my friend the price of small pizza so he decided to order. While they were preparing, the lady kept looking at us the weird way. When my friend went to the counter to pay for it, he looked confused. We realized she misinformed him about the price. He told me if I wanted to share and I said "Heck no" because I could literally see the pizza sliding left and right inside the box because the bottom was drenched with oil. I told him the pizza looked trash and he said it's also too salty but my poor buddy had no choice but to put it in his mouth because he was starving. rip
3128;Absolutely pathetic behavior and food quality. Ordered home delivery via skipthedishes and after a wait of 1:30 hours got served stale meat and food. Had to discard almost 50$ worth food. Have officially filed a complained with the health and safety department. When i called in the owner he started yelling "do what you want". Do yourselves afavor and skip this restaurant at all costs.
3129;Skip this place.  Terrible customer service , terrible food and a messy restaurant.  Why would you go here?  Don't waste your money. Send a message by taking your dollars elsewhere.  Mom and Pop mentality does not work in the restaurant business.
3130;Worst service ever. The most bullshit desi restaurant ever. I will never advise anyone of you to waste your time here. The owner is disrespectful as well.
3131;Probably one of the most disgusting places I have ever been in Mississauga. Dirty, dirty, dirty. We could not even eat the food we ordered after we enter the to the washrooms and sit on one of the dining tables. Just disgusting. Even a rat would have problem eating here.
3132;**HORRIBLE** I placed an order through skip the dishes. 15min later while the driver is on his way, They called and said they are missing a roti and dont have the Daal Makhni. They will be give me some naan and some roti and also replace my order with Chanaa masala. I told them to at least keep it all naan and not mix and match and give me anything else (I will pay the difference). The conversation is pretty calm so far. Some older dude grabs the phone from the girl and starts yelling at me on the phone as If I owe him money. He is like "take what we have OR cancel the order" and "we have no other dishes in the whole resturant". I had already paid for the order and I'v waited 20 minutes by now. ** Extremely rude management and subpar food** DO NOT ORDER and TAKE YOUR MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE.
3133;We tried this restaurant seeing there was a management change.  Although the people seem genuine and helpful there is no customer service....no smiles...no thank you's.......the food was awful....it's almost as if they steeped everything with tea and let it go bitter.   Overloaded with spices there is a terrible aftertaste.   It's too bad because this restaurant could have a loyal following if it executed right in Quality, Service and Ambiance.   Sadly the ownership change has not resulted in a revamped operation.  Tables were not cleaned right away...no uniforms....this place shows desperation to a paying guest....I'm taking my food spend elsewhere.
3134;Where to start? Well my Fiancée, a friend an I arrived here on a quiet day at around 430pm. We were greeted by the manager of the establishment fairly promptly and he even took our drink orders, he told us that our waitress will be with us shortly. About 3 minutes later she approached our table and asked what we would like to drink, when we told her that the manager took care of the drink she seemed very shocked. We received our drinks fairly quickly but we were then left alone and ignored for about 25 minutes before we could even order. She took our orders down  and said she will be back shortly with our food. Well I guess everyone has a different version of shortly. 45 minutes go by and still no food in sight, we asked the waitress what is going on, very flustered she tells us it is coming out now. We asked her to have it to go in this case as we now do not have time to sit down and enjoy our meal. I also asked her if she can provide us with pop to go seeing as how we paid for them and since they it so we c
3135;I tried something new from Swiss Chalet the other day and it was great.  So, I ordered delivery from work and instead of a sandwich piled with beef I got one with a few crumbs of overcooked beef, and watered-down soup.  Past problems have included other examples of chintziness and hair in my food a couple of time in a rows.  The food quality here compared to other locations is night and day.  Unfortunately you can't choose your delivery locations, so I stupidly keep giving them another chance.  No more, which is unfortunate because I usually do like the food at Swiss Chalet.  Something is just terribly wrong with this location the past couple of months.  If you are craving something from Swiss, I would highly recommend trying a different location.  Avoid avoid avoid.
3136;Awful - will rethink Swiss Chalet as a whole after seeing how bad this location is. Serving old dry chicken to try to turn a profit.  This has happened on multiple occasions... If I could give this place 0 stars or negative I would
3137;Horrible. My pizza and wings were under cooked, the service from the employees was horrendous. And when I asked if i could get the pizza cooked a bit more, they were extremely rude telling me I was holding up the line. 10/10 would never go back again.
3138;This place is consistently terrible. I bought a medium pizza and breadstick yesterday and was disappointed once again. The breadsticks were squished in to a box and cut in to oblong pieces. Furthermore, the pizza and breadsticks were dry. This pizza hut location has been consistently terrible.
3139;Terrible customer service. They don't put enough toppings on their pizza which would have otherwise been forgivable abd something I'd let slide but I went there today and place my order of 3 pizzas and paid by 9:02 PM (receipt says so). At 9:30 my mom followed up with the people behind the counter to ask where our order was because at that point, others who walked in after we did already left with their food. They said 5 minutes and I told her to calm down because these people probably ordered online for pickup maybe. Finally, the only other people waiting for their order got their pizza already (and we saw and heard them place their order 5 to 10 minutes after we did). Approached the counter and asked them where ours was. Some guy (the cook?) approaches another guy who seems to be the boss and told him that the one coming out was part of our order. Saw two pizza boxes that have been sitting on the counter for more than 15 minutes to ask if those were part of our order and they said yes. We asked them but the
3140;Ordered delivery from here. Delivery driver was rude. Pizza was undercooked (still doughy).I will never eat here again. If you're a fan of Pizza Hut you'd be better off going to the birchmount and ellesmere location.
3141;Can anyone tell me why suddenly I keep getting Rene's Caesar dressing and Heinz marinara instead of the Pizza Hut Caesar and their tomato sauce. Gone way way way down hill since what seems like a franchise ownership change. Been a costumer here for 20 years and now I'd never eat here, shame.
3142;I ordered a single pizza for delivery on Friday night at 7:30pm. Waited an hour and nothing came. I decided to give them a call to see what's up. They didn't pick up their phone, so I was routed to the Pizza Hut call centre, where I found out it was going to be a 2 hour wait. Normally, I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and blame it on a busy Friday night, but this is the second time its happened. The first time, when the pizza finally arrived, it was burnt, tasteless, and hardly had any toppings!
3143;Just came from here. The entire experience was shockingly bad.Before I went I called to check how late their dining room was open. Was greeted "HithankyouforcallingPizzaHutpleasehold" in pretty much one word. I wait for about 4 minutes. Someone picks up again and it's "HithankyouforcallingPizzaHutpleasehold" before I can explain I've already been put on hold and have a simple question. I checked my phone and I had been on hold for 9 minutes before someone was actually able to speak with me. I should've taken that as a red flag and stayed clear.We arrive and stand at the empty hostess desk for just under 5 minutes before we're greeted by anyone. The restaurant seems very busy with everyone running around stressed. We're told we have to wait for them to clear a table which is fine. We wait just over 5 minutes when they take us to the one empty table that isn't full of crap from the last guests. Literally every other table desperately needed to be bussed. This was a table I'd seen from the door that was empt
3144;So dissappointed when i tried to substitute a garlic bread with cheese instead of bread sticks on the combo in restaurant, two items of equal value on the menu, and was just given an outright no. no reason offered, even when i brought up that they were the same price.Also, ordered extra cheese, didn't get it. And checked the bill, and the waitress didn't put it in right.Food was as expected, so so pizza, Yada Yada Yada.
3145;Worst experience for me and my family... When I wanted to order pizza they said I have to 1 and a half hour for just a pizza!!!Went to some other DesiPizza store better than tht !
3146;Horrible! Waited forever for our appetizer and forever again for our pizza which was ridiculously overcooked. It was supposed to be a cheese lovers pizza but had the least amount of cheese I have ever hat on pizza. It was cardboard. The waitress hung around in the kitchen the whole time. Another table of patrons actually got up to ask the kitchen if their food would be ready soon. All of the patrons including myself had to get up to go to the front of the restaurant to get our cheque. I will never go back. Vapid service and lazy execution!
3147;If it was possible to give minus one star I would give it 2 stars. Worst possible customer service experience in the history of customer service. We ordered wings as appetizer and the waitress came and left the wings on table. No plates, No forks or knives, no napkins no water. I called her to ask if we can get plates, she said oh sorry and brought us plates still no utensils. She didn't give ranch dipping sauce with wings for celery and carrots had to call her again for that. We ordered stuffed crust and she forgot about that. She charged us for stuffed crust even though a huge sign in front of store said "try stuffed crust free" . Then she brought someone else's salad and left at our table! We told her we didn't order salad. My daughter counted all the mistakes 11 altogether!!! We didn't get forks and knives till the end and we are pizza with hands and just left never to go back again!
3148;The "food" is awful and the service is even worse. Just trying to get a seat and be served is an arduous experience. Then you have to wait, and wait for the plates of cold, stodgy carbs, I gave it a second chance, and that was it...never again. Honestly, I can only conclude this is a way for organized crime to launder its ill gotten gains there is no other way to explain why it still exists.
3149;Not that I am racism but those Indian waitress there seem like don't understand English! I ordered ice coffee no sugar every time and they gave me ice coffee with sugar for four times! And you know what's funny? I have only been there for five times. BTW, the new desert strawberry shortcake muffin is good.
3150;Worst service ever. Prime reason I will not go to this place again. The drive thru and inside was full. Slowest service I have ever experienced. It took me 1 full hour (just ordered 2 veggie burgers) to leave and I went inside because the drive thru seemed long. They kept taking orders but people were waiting for the food. Some people who ordered after me got their food before me for some reason. Some people ahead of me were irritated because of that and asked for the managers contact information. The people assembling the burgers couldn't even put the toppings on right. I said no ice for the Pepsi I ordered yet I received one with ice so I told them. The guy then just dumped the ice and didn't put the lid on right which caused it to spill there. Bottom line: service is the worst, go to a different location instead.
3151;Visiting family here in Brampton from out of country, somebody mentioned Harvey's so we went there. Hands down one of the worst fast food experiences I've ever had to deal with. The tall lanky brown kid (who might've been the manager) had the worst demeanor and body language I've ever seen from any employee. Just yelling at employees and overall sh*t attitude. Each one of the employees looks like they hate their job, especially that brown kid. Food was below average, didn't finish it. Definitely won't ever go back.
3152;I was there on Nov.21 at 7:30pm to get a late take out dinner. I stood at the counter for 9 minutes waiting for someone to at least take my order! It took them another 10 minutes for them to get my order together! The restaurant was not busy, there were employees standing around doing NOTHING! I did not get to complain verbaly to them as I was ignored other than when they took my order and gave me my food. Worst Wendy's experience ever!
3153;Got a large piece of plastic in my Chili once. That was extremely creepy as hell biting into it. We only really come here for a cup of coffee and a Frosty.
3154;Worst Osmow's location! Do not go here whatever you do. Horrible customer service and the wraps here barely have any sauce in them even if you ask for extra.The best location is in Brampton at Chrystler Drive and Williams Pkwy.
3155;What kind of osmows does not offer pickles? Just because it's in a brampton locations where it's mostly brown people who don't fancy pickles doesn't mean that the entire rest of the population that lives here doesn't want that. Every osmows location has pickles, i demand pickles! Osmows should be consistent everywhere i don't want to look for their menu online before stepping out of my car, it's a hassle and inconvenient and they need to change that. I have 10 middle eastern friends who are all osmows fans and this location has definitely lost our business due to their no pickle policy.
3156;Extremely rude employees. Did not want to serve me. They were all talking huddled in a group. Unprofessional. I ask for tomato sauce and they told me to buy dipping sauce. That it was illegal to give me tomato sauce for my pizza??? What the heck!! The girl that works has such an attitude. The whole staff in this place unprofessional and extremely rude. Will not be returning and will not buy pizza pizza. I will not spend my money on poor managed franchise!
3157;One of the most terrible ordering experiences in my life. First off, I got a combo for a large pizza with 3 toppings and 3 drinks. When it came to choose the toppings, the older guy serving me kept telling me the meat toppings I picked needed extra charge, which is fine. But when I asked him then could you please tell me which toppings are free? He's like just look on the list it says on there. When I told him it didn't show it on the screen, he kept yelling at me saying just read the screen and walked away.  But it clearly did not show it on the screen, I wish I took a picture of it. He came back and I asked him to please list the ones that are free, and he just said rudely to read the screen and walked away again! Rude!Finally a younger server came over to help and this server patiently listed all the free meat ingredients which turned out to only be bacon and sausages.........  Which is weird since we used to order a lot from this Pizza Pizza and chicken/ steak were all included in the combo choices. A
3158;This is the closest Pizza Pizza to my hood so i tend to pop to get a slice or two for the kids.  Evertime i go there the slices they have on display look terrible.  Like the location doesnt give a eff about presentation.  I always ask them if they have any new slices being cooked but they always say NO because they want to get rid of their display stuff firat understandable but i dont think anybody is going to buy that stuff unless its free food. I have ordered online for pick up and its not bad  pizza but going there on for a quick bite i wouldnt even try again.  With that in mind i think i rather geg pizza at a different place or when i do order online pick up at another location.  This place isnt really appealing anymore i hope they get their act together soon.
3159;The place was empty except for our party of 12, but it was Super Bowl Sunday so I'll assume most restaurants are fairly empty on this day. I wouldn't be surprised if it was this empty all the time though, because this is essentially an overpriced tourist trap with crappy food. I guess its to be expected that the restaurants in Unionville are tourist traps, as Main St is a mini Niagara on the Lake wannabe. I ordered the $30 prix fixe course, with roasted portobello, chicken valdostana and tiramisu. First, the bread. The bread came out cold and tasted like a cheap baguette from No Frills. The garlic butter that it came with was nothing to write home about. I've had much yummier warm bread with delicious spreads from many Italian places, so this was a big disappointment.The portobello was a meh...a little bit dry, OK flavour, vegetables on the side  a bit overcooked. I've made much better portobello myself.The chicken was just nasty and unappetizing with some overly salty "wine sauce" that tasted like so
3160;ugh. Terrible. Worst restaurant in Markham and that's saying something. We  ate here FOUR times / gave them FOUR chances / and it got worse each time. Terrible food, terribly high prices, terrible asshole staff and owners. Avoid at all costs. How do I give zero stars - is that possible ?????
3161;The OWNER was so rude to is and our kids. We had made reservation on a Saturday night and the owner greeted us at the door. When we called to make this reservation, we requested to be seated on the patio, but it was busy and we understood that it may not happen. Once we were greeted by a less than inviting gentleman at the door, we saw that our table was set and ready inside. We mentioned that we had requested to be seated on the patio and the OWNER said to us "No you didn't". We then asked how long it would be to wait for a patio table? He said that there was not one available and just got even more flustered. We were ready to accept the table inside and just sit down for a lovely dinner when he started getting even more rude to us. I said to him that none of us were trying to give him a hard time and that's when he snapped. He said to us that we were just pushing him to give us a table outside and he was quite visibly without patience of any kind, not that we were after anything other than a nice meal from 
3162;I had dinner with my son, without hesitation come across this place , we were serve bread which is very dry and cold. We got the fixed meal of 29.99. The worst meal we ever had and overprice. I will never come back to this place again
3163;In total, i've been here 3 times..not including take out once.I've got to say...every time I go here, the food goes downhill. I was completely in love with this restaurant when i was first brought here. The deco was nice, music was beautiful, the food was EXCELLENT (I ordered the seafood pasta and the creme brule) , however...the service..OMG! It's always the same guy serving us. He was very polite to my company, since my company knows him, but he COMPLETELY IGNORED ME ALL THOSE TIMES, not ever looking in my direction AT ALL , other then taking my order and when he was taking my order, he was RUDE. I wanted to slap him!As I was saying...our experience after that was horrid. The same usual crappy rude service.Actually, the last time I went there, I got sick. The seafood pasta tasted very off and my creme brule....was COLD. The bottom was FROZEN actually. As soon as we left the restaurant, I had to run out to puke. I was disgusted...vowing to never go there again.
3164;This place tries, very hard, to be an upscale Italian restaurant, but fails, equally as hard, in doing so. The location for a restaurant like this cannot be better. You would think that the ownership who are paying thousands to have this location would capitalize on this but they don't. Food is below average. Came for a function. Will never be back.
3165;We went here on Mother's Day this year. Granted Mother's Day is insane no matter where you go, this restaurant was not a good experience in any way. We made reservations beforehand (because you needed to) and yet when we arrived no one talked to us and just kept running past us. When we finally stopped someone and said we had reservations he looked down at the table seating and pointed with his head where our table was. We weren't entirely sure and one of the other wait staff (a young girl) doubled checked to make sure. She apologized and was probably the only person who knew proper restaurant service and knew how to run the place. We were placed right in front of the patio door and squished between two other large groups.... Sorry but if we made reservations and so did the other people you should make sure you have enough floor space to seat all of these people. 2 people from my party of 5 had to stand up at least 8 times during our meal to let people pass because there was not enough room.The food was ju
3166;Ate there last summer.  What a huge disappointment.  The place is dusty and very dated.  The waitress screwed up our order, I ordered veal and received chicken.  For the price of the food, I swear it tasted like a michelina frozen entree.  Really for over $22.00, I should be getting fresh homemade pasta, not the crap I was served, it barely filled a soup cup.  Really bad place to eat.  Never been back, and never going back. Stay away.  By the way, comping a free pour drink doesn't impress when your food is crap.
3167;I would have given it a half star if such an option exists. Slow service, bad hygiene, crappy food, all the bad things you can think of. Stay away from this place when you are in unionville village.
3168;I wish I can give 0 stars. Super slow service! Mussels are not fresh! Can't think of one thing that is gd abt this place! Do not come!!!
3169;Never coming back here again!This place is atrocious, I would not recommend anyone dining here. First off, the place wasn't that busy but I still had to wait to be seated, secondly, the level of hygiene in this place was disgusting. The glass of water I was served had green particles of something floating in it, yuck! So I wasn't drinking out of that glass. My utensils the spoon had leftover particles on it as well so I wasn't using that.I ordered the gnocchi, you get a small portion and it's over-priced.The place is so dark inside too, bad lighting. Service was slow, they took so long to get my food to me that the waiter even came up to me and said "Don't worry we haven't forgotten about you sir!".I'm done!
3170;I came in here and ordered the 2 Cajun Poutines, one for myself and the other for my daughter. It was there special of the day, and with it ordered one spicy breast piece. The cashier said it would take 6 minutes, in which literally took 13 min and told her I'd wait. When receiving our order, we looked for a seat to sit down, which was not to difficult since we were the only patrons.... Hence the tables were not clean and had chicken crumbs    And other residue. I told the cashier in which she came by and wiped it down with a wet towel, not a Lysol wipe. My daughter took one bite of the poutine and said Ewee nasty, the fries were mushy and the cheese had a different look and texture, no cheese curds here. The cheese looked literally like toothpaste as the cheese was very white. What really annoyed me was the chicken burnt my mouth when I took my bite as the oil was juicing out if the chicken when I took the bite. I gave her my piece of my mind and all she said " oh I'm sooty it was suppose to cool down. Bel
3171;I'll never understand "fast" food restaurants that don't have enough food prepared at a rush time like dinner time. Why as a customer should I have to wait 15 minutes or accept alternates like smaller pieces or spicy when I want mild unless being encouraged to do so by way of a discount. Managers should have a better handle of the flow and be ready. Rant over. Going somewhere else.
3172;The special sauce tastes terrible. Mashed potatoes are mediocre. The chicken isn't cooked properly and it was dry. Enough said. Do not waste your time and money.
3173;I should of followed my gut and walked out when I was saw at least 7 tables uncleared from the previous customers while we were being seated, but I thought I would give them the benefit of doubt.  To me, multiple tables with uncleared plates from previous customers screams bad management , which likely leads to bad service and food. After being seated i waited to see just how long it took from the tables to be cleared. It wasn't until a manager came in yelling At a bus boy and forcing him to goTo the tables did they finally get cleared. A few minutes later our waitress came up and took our order, which was a smooth process.  Drinks were served timely and from there everything seemed ok. That is until the food came...Orders were delivered for several people at our table with the explanation that they were "out of dark meat" (chicken) and that they would give them white meat (chicken) at no charge. At no time did the restaurant  even consider the customer may not have wanted white meat and they just as
3174;First, let me say, I LOVE SWISS CHALET in general.  I frequent many locations but...I have tried this Swiss Chalet at least 3 times and every single time, THEY FAIL.  The chicken wrap is gross, smells weird and has undercooked bacon in it.  The fries have been awful everytime.  Other Swiss Chalet locations are good but trust me, AVOID THIS ONE!!
3175;Not very friendly service, they don't speak or understand English very well. Food was very oily and  not very tasty. I asked for raita about ten times and was assured five times it would be in there then it wasn't. If you're looking for a decent meal is drive right by this place
3176;Horrible place! The service is terrible and the servers are very rude. The food is always overly salted and the meat is over cooked and chewy. Don't waste your money on this restaurant.
3177;Rude man taking orders, rolled my eyes at me a couple of times because I was unsure what to order and could not understand him. I love south Asian food, but I don't know all their names. If you decide to go, park far away from everyone else because the patrons will dent your car door. Never again.
3178;I ordered sweet and sour chicken balls with rice for take out. The chicken balls were very stale, dry and hard. You can't even slice it with a knife nor chew it. I ended up throwing it in the trash. It was chicken balls possibly cooked the day before and just heated up for my order the next day. LEFTOVERS!!! The funny thing too was, it's an order that comes with 12 pieces of chicken balls with rice. My order was missing a chicken ball. Seriously?! I paid for old, stale left overs and a missing chicken ball! Smh!!
3179;Disgusting restaurant. Smells terrible, terrible customer service and dirty place. NEVER going back. I asked for spicy buffalo wings to go. Since I was starving and did not want to eat there, thought I would go home n eat. Guess what? I emphasized on how spicy I wanted it but when I went home and opened the box, no sauce, not Buffalo, forget spicy..it was the worst fried chicken wings I have tried. I threw it out.
3180;Restaurant look disgusting smell weird . The food i order i did not like the quality for the money i pay . Chicken was uncooked rice was hard . For sure i did not  going back again.
3181;This was probably one of the worst restaurant experiences I have had in a very long time.  My husband and I ordered the Parmesan fries to start.  I doubt they were tossed in garlic butter as described and barely had a trace of Parmesan cheese.  No taste and dry. I ordered the Chicken Piccata which was supposed to have a sauce on it with capers and pancetta.  The chicken came dry with no sign of a caper or pancetta. I asked the server if I had gotten the right dish and she replied yes, and that the sauce is only just brushed on so you can't see it. Really?  Anyhow, it was served over undercooked bland white rice, with vegetables that had a strange seasoning on them, almost curry-like.  They were terrible.  My husband had the pork schnitzel which he could only describe as "edible".  It came with German potato salad that was so dry I could barely get it down with my drink.  When the server came back to clear the dishes and saw that I didn't eat much, I told her how terrible everything was.  She did not apo
3182;I am rewriting this review. I said it's always fast and reliable previously.. not so much. I like how this one is 24/7 but hate the fact that the later it gets, the more they run out of absolutely everything- including their staff. That's not the issue. Bf wanted food here today and I already knew that they probably have zero to maybe 1-2 vegetarian choices (usually I take those and make it vegan), we went through the drive thru and I asked them to take out all the dairy products in the mediterrean veggie wrap. The girl took out most of the ingredients.. feta cheese, the sauce.. even the hummus? Last time I checked, hummus was vegan but whatever. I didn't want to delay her so I just pleaded to make sure there's absolutely no dairy in it. She ensured me that it would all be taken out and she had gone through all the ingredients.Later at home, after a few bites into it while watching a movie, I looked down and saw little white chunks.. unsure if they were crunchy bits or something else, I licked it and inde
3183;Slow service, seats are uncomfortable, wifi ok but no power outlets. Much better options out there.
3184;Went in on thursday feb 23, 2017 at 12:10am (technically feb 24).Ordered a big mac with extra mac sauce.One of the patties was shrunk and burnt, very little mac sauce, and the big mac had no pickles.   Tasted nothing like a big mac.  I mean who is working in the back, who doesn't put pickles in a big mac? and why give me a charcoal burnt patty?That wasn't a normal burger, it was a "disgruntled employee burger". I have eaten many big macs something like this has never happened before.For the owner, i gave you exact time i was there.  You and I both know what you have to do.  Someone in the back is costing you money.
3185;Avoid it if you can, burgers are under cooked, same with any bacon they cook. Plus items are more expensive here than downtown Toronto or In the West End of Toronto.
3186;How can classic fast food rate higher than a one star?If you're into crowded and slow service fast food places this is one to visit else you'll do yourself a favor by going somewhere else.
3187;This one has to be the one with worse customer service, speed and quality out if all McDonald's. I came here to grab a free coffee during their promotion period. Saw the line for the drive thru wasn't too long so I decided to pull thru. I asked for 2 small coffees, one for me and my friend which is waiting in the parking lot. Makes no sense to idle 2 cars thru drive thru for coffee. The employee asks if there was 2 people in my car or else I can't get 2 coffees. I told her my friend is in the parking lot plus there's no restrictions on the promo anyways. She hesitated, giving me attitude then she's like fine, second window. She didn't ask if I wanted anything else, whatsoever. When I drove pass the 1st window, she gave me a face with unsatisfied attitude, and wave her hand to keep me moving. NEVER EVER COME TO THIS LOCATION!!!!
3188;This McDonald's service is all over the place. Either you get someone really nice, or someone who just wants an empty restaurant. For today though, the service was awful. I am not the type to rate restaurants (if you can even call this place a restaurant) but this is an exception. This manager saw me and a friend walk in with bags of groceries and of course, we want to put some stuff down (because it's heavy) before we order food. We did have an open bag of snacks walking in but thats because my friend has diabetes and needs some food or she will faint. The manager approached us as the moment we sat down and immediately told us to leave if we eat the food inside or he'll throw the food away and kick us out. We told him that we just needed to put our groceries down, my friend has diabetes, and that we were going to order as soon as we can. But he said the same thing, left, and continued to eye us. It became too uncomfortable for us to even continue our stay, the embarrassment alone was unbearable because he vo
3189;I've drove thru here many times and a lot of times they forget to pack a straw, or fork, or forget to give me a hash Brown, or forget to give me my drink. Today was that. I don't usually give bad reviews, but that was the final straw
3190;There are not that many choices for food in Terminal 3. I would avoid this place if you can though. Staff is very slow and hard to comprehend. The lady in front of me had a tough time paying for her purchase. It took nearly 10 minutes for the two of them to conclude a $2.00 transaction. The traveler wanted to use U.S. currency to pay and the cashier couldn't decide what exchange rate to charge. The sign posted at the register had an outdated rate listed and the cashier kept mumbling a number that the customer (or I for that fact) couldn't understand. My total time in line was 15 minutes to obtain a bagel and orange juice. And I was the second person in the line. I should have just walked away...
3191;Lazy and unmotivated staff. Two workers chat while 8 empty tables wait for much needed wipe. When i suggested one worker do so she slowly moved around wiping with a dirty cloth, then returned to chat With coworker and snack on cafe food. Salad fine and soup quite good so owner should act now before others avoid.
3192;I have previously written a review about Planet Pizza, and my terribly negative experience with them. Unfortunately, that review was filtered for reasons that I am unaware of. To view my prior review about Planet Pizza and their terrible customer service, click on the (filtered) button at the bottom left. I took a great deal of time to write a lengthy and detailed review of my experiences with the Planet Pizza staff, but that was obviously disregarded. According to Yelp's policy statement, they filter reviews that are "unreliable". I do not know how they came to that conclusion, but my review was obviously not fake, as I actually named employees from the restaurant. I thought Yelp was a consumer based site that was intended to help consumers make conscious decisions about where to eat. Clearly they are catering to businesses as an advertising venue instead. Let's see how long it is until this gets filtered too. Dont make the same mistake I did. Do NOT eat at or order from Planet Pizza. They have no se
3193;Terrible. If I could give this place zero stars I would.After a night of drinks with my girls, we decided to grab some pizza at this place. We ordered and paid for our pizza and then the clerk said something to the other employee in their own language, and then started laughing. Luckily one of the girls with us spoke that language and she immediately confronted him. Apparently they were talking shit about us (calling us names that I will not repeat on here). I couldn't believe this, thinking that we were valued customers. Our friend demanded they give us a refund after they denied saying what they did (of course), but gave us a refund without hesitation, probably because they knew what they did was wrong.The people working at Planet Pizza are the scum of the earth and have no respect for women, probably because of their culture/religion/background. Do not waste a DIME on these people, because they will only talk crap about you behind your back and probably spit in your pizza while they're at it.
3194;Distinctly poor pizza. Worse customer service. Would thoroughly recommend you try elsewhere if you like pizza. Tbh I'm surprised it manages to stay open because I can imagine they don't get many repeat customers. After I went here I told my friends and they said they had similar experiences and now stay well away. Enough said
3195;Plenty of deals, reasonable valuePizza is mediocre at best, subar to be honest, nor are the wings goodDidnt receive expected garlic breadWebsite interface lacks all the offers, had to chat with online helper to get phone number - no phone number to order from on websiteBest thing is that this place is open until 2am (and sometimes 4am)
3196;Bad experience, the delivery took an hour an a half, the pizza was ok, the wings were horrible and they forgot the garlic bread that we ordered. Won't be ordering from them again.
3197;I used to love coming here after the bar for a slice, or ordering in for a fast cheap decent pizza. (It was still only a 3 at best) In the past year or so both the service and the quality has gone waayy down hill.The last time I ordered a pizza, the sun dried tomatoes were black and tasted horrible, and the "Italian sausage" was more like sliced hot dogs. The dipping sauce was wrong, I got Pepsi instead of Coke, and the delivery guy (was nice buuuttt) had only 20's on him so we couldn't make change for a tip.I called to complain that they had gotten our order wrong, and the guy argued with me that the Italian sausage was just not the spicy kind...and they didn't have hot dogs on their menu (although the menu clearly states they have: Italian sausage, spicy Italian sausage AND frankfurter sausage.) He blamed the other problems on the delivery man and asked if I'd like him to come back to give me the right kind of dipping sauce to which I said yes, but the driver never came. This pretty much ruined my night.
3198;1* for being open super late1* for being different 1* for being dirt cheap-6* for getting a stomachache from eating bad pizza.What more is there to say?
3199;I've been here twice. Once drunk, and once sober. Neither time did the food satisfy. The pizza is not good. It's not even the average Toronto slice. It's bland and in my experience not fresh. When I went sober they had pizzas in the warmer stacked on top of each other. Obviously if there were any kind of freshness involved they would be stuck together by melted cheese and quite a mess. Sadly there was no mess. The bigger annoyance, though, was how I asked for one slice of pizza and the worker presented me with two and told me to grab a drink as well. I told him I wanted one slice, no drink (this was just an afternoon snack after all). Apparently that's not an option. So I paid upward of $4 for two slices of nasty pizza. When I picked it up he reminded me to grab a drink. When I sat at the table he reminded me to get a drink. Each time I told him politely I didn't want the drink. When I was done the first slice he told me to grab a drink. I might have yelled at him at that point that I don't want the damn drin
3200;Simply terrible!  A violation of my taste buds! Had the small naked (no shell) chicken the first time. I wanted to try a different burrito joint in the area and was truly sorry I came here. I will stick with Burrito Boyz a few buildings down. Burrito Boyz make THE BEST burrito hands down. Back to my review of Fat Bastards... Nothing fat about it. In fact the portion size is very lean on this tiny shallow tray where the portion size was about half of B Boyz, and cost more too!  Taste wise the chicken was horrible. It was mushy and way over cooked like boiled and unseasoned shredded chicken thrown on the toppings. The rest of the toppings were also mushy too like it was a meal cooked for seniors.  Please do your wallet and gut a big favour and avoid his place no matter how tempted you are.
3201;DIARRHEA. How's that for a start? Ordered two "roasted steak" burritos through Foodora. Delivery service was fine but the food?-mushy-watery-bland-asked for extra spicy, and what we received wouldnt even classify as mild because it was flavorless Both of us has stomach problems and diarrhea as a result. Can't speak for other locations, but this one is an absolute embarrassment.
3202;UGH sad, my friends talked up Fat Bastard so much this weekend that I decided to try it out instead of my usual place in the Grange. WHAT A MISTAKE. They had it ready when I got there (used ritual) so that was good but that is where the good ends. I got the sweet and spicy tofu with beans, rice, cheese, cilantro, Guac, sour cream, Bastard Sauce and Crunchies. All I could taste was sauce, cheese and  rice for half of it. Then I got to the worst tofu I have ever had! I actually picked it out!!! I have never done that before. It tasted stale, just awful. There were no crunchies, the whole thing was soggy and extremely bland even with all that sauce. By far the worst burrito I have ever had, and I am mad at my friends for making me waste 10.00! Though it does seem like people are saying it is this location, it was so bad that I will not be trying any of their other ones.
3203;They truly live up to the second word in their namesake. What a fucking joke - ordered a steak burrito with medium heat and received a mild pulled pork. When I confronted the cook about the error, he insisted that what I had was steak. Yeah, what a load of shit. I pointed out that the burrito I had wasn't spicy (a further indication that they mixed up orders) and he just tossed me a cup of spicy sauce.The burrito itself was a massive letdown, even for someone who usually enjoys pulled pork. Watery, mushy, lukewarm.
3204;AWFUL RIP OFF! We ordered a bean and cheese burrito and a stir fried veggie burrito. They were expensive and BOTH were 90% rice!!! When I called the restaurant to complain they told me to order and pay for another one. NEVER BUY FROM HERE!!! There are tons of great burrito places in Toronto including Burrito Boyz. Don't waste your money or aggravation with this awful place.
3205;Food was by far the worst tasting Mexican 'food' I've ever had. The chips and salsa were flavorless and my burrito had noodles in it! Topped off by the fact that I immediately got sick after eating the vegetarian burrito.  I would not recommend this establishment. I can't believe they're still open for business.
3206;@bastardburrito @foodora_ca #BASTARDBURRITO #BURRITO #HURRIER I should've read the reviews of this particular location before I placed an order on Hurrier, now Foodora. I ordered a large burrito, and sure enough it was a good size. However, the burrito was soggy and unappetizing. Didn't taste the lime or the guacamole. I was going to blame it on the delivery service first, but it's clearly this location. I would love to try an actual fat bastard burrito from another location and maybe I'll have a few comparisons to make.
3207;I'm normally a fan of Fat Bastard Burrito but this is the WORST location I've been to and I think it ruins the good brand that it has. The burrito itself was also terrible. I ordered a large baha chicken which looked like a small one. I'm usually not one to complain but I've eaten so many of these burritos that I can tell when I've been short changed and this is the one instance. They said they wrapped it really tight. While watching them make it, there may have been a sliver of guac that was put on whereas if you went to a competitor (Chipotle, Burrito Boyz, Quesada) they would have put on at least 3 times as much guac.I would not recommend going to this location and I think if they keep this out, they'll continue to be empty. I don't normally have bad experiences that are worth noting but this is definitely the worse. I will not be coming back here as my money is better spent somewhere else and not wasted here.
3208;Why on earth did I not check reviews of this place before I ordered.First of all, delivery took almost an hour inside downtown. The burrito was meh and as I was finishing the burrito I noticed it had lots of noodles in it. NOODLES! Since when have the Mexicans started putting Chinese noodles in burritos? I guess a cheap way to fill people up. I ordered 'roasted steak' but it looked like pork to me. I guess another way to make the burrito cheaper.Then the fun started. Both me and my wife had upset stomachs all night. My stomach was upset the next day as well.How the city allows this germ hole to stay open with multiple reports of people getting sick is beyond me. I would not eat their burritos for free.
3209;This is the WORST burrito I have ever had. It basically tasted like mush. I got the fried tequila lime chicken burrito and the chicken was dry. I believe I actually ate the fried batter. Do not waste your money on this place.
3210;Brought my kids to this hero burger and was greatly disappointed!  Though on the menu it advertises a kids menu, when I asked, the manager said that there isn't.  Forced to order from adult menu, which is significantly more expensive.  Then I had a coupon for a free sundae (for every combo purchased), again I was told no and oh that the sundae machine is broken anyway.  How convenient!! First and LAST time at hero burger. Never again!!!
3211;Worst experience ever!!!! They spit in my food...can u imagine? DO NOT TRUST!The old guy in combination is lethal! I don't know if he's the owner, but very unfriendly and revenge oriented...
3212;Food is always burnt (even when asking for lightly toasted) rude service. They constantly give attitude and never get orders right. The hash browns also taste like complete crap! Would never recommend this place. If you like rude and ignorant workers come, if you don't go somewhere else. Trust me
3213;I would give 0 stars if possible. This Tim Hortons is very slow, and every time i have been here there has been some problem. Their hash browns always taste bad and the employees are very rude. If you have a complaint about your order or they forget something they get angry with you, even though they are the ones that screwed up.   Everyone i know now avoids this tims because it is not worth the time or effort. Definitely avoid this timmies.
3214;$10 for 2 slices is not $ and the pizza was old and bitter obviously re-heated multiple times! That's all
3215;We ordered two pizzas via their website almost 2 hours ago. We were patient and waited just over an hour before calling to see what the issue was. I even asked my boyfriend to check the confirmation and he showed me the email.When I called the store, the man who answered simply said that he did not have my order. I confirmed the number of the store and the address and told him that I had a confirmation email. He said it was not his fault, but he would send out the pizzas.Starving, after waiting for 2 hours already, I asked him how long it would take. He said right away. I asked how long he estimated that I would have to wait, but he could not confirm.I asked if there would be a discount, seeing as how I was patient and still willing to pay for the pizzas. He told me "No". He said he could not determine if it was my fault or his fault, maybe just the internet. I reminded him that I was a paying customer who had a confirmation for my order and that I'm thus case it would be good business to give a discoun
3216;I don't where to start really. Came into town for a conference and ordered a pizza at a nearby Mammas, only a couple blocks away. Ordered a simple 2 topping pizza for delivery to my hotel (Hyatt) Pizza arrived 1 hour 25 minutes later, cold and undercooked. The meat on top didn't even look like it was safe to eat to be honest. Clearly no care was taken in the making of my order. Unbelievably disappointing. Will never order again from any Mammas location.
3217;Absolutely disgusting. Pizza was cool when it was delivered (I live two blocks away) so the cheese was already rubbery. It was a pallid shade of grey, and may have actually been rubber. The crust was the same texture. Disturbing. Only twice in my life have I had a pizza so bad I needed to throw most of it out. This was one of those times.(FYI the other was at Adriatic Restaurant in Manhattan.)
3218;Horrible Pizza - very oily, literally drips. Wings smelt terrible, it was obviously reheated. Will never go again.
3219;I had better pizza in Asia. With our pickup the bread was soggy and the pepperoni was colourless. Weirdly my boyfriends stomach hurt very bad after attempting a slice making us wonder if the meat was even good. This pizza was anything but fresh and easily the worst pizza I have ever had for such crap prices.
3220;Unless you're absolutely dying for a Timmie's fix, avoid this place.....the regular Tim Horton rules don't apply.  (That or the staff is all under the influence of something).  Slow as molasses in January and certainly wearing ear plugs.  Cannot take an order correctly to save their lives.  It's like they've never been trained.....the only way you know that you're at a Tim Horton's is the sign out front and the food (when you finally get it) is the same as you'd get at a location that actually WANTS to serve you.  There are two other locations in the area:  Queen East in the Beach and the other at Leslie and Lakeshore. Go there, they actually want your business.
3221;Wow. The service here is horrendous! The employees behave like they have no training, no accountability, and no manager. They forgot to actually put the donuts in a bag and give them to us. Then they informed the customers outside at the tables that they had to leave 12 minutes before closing, right after we got our food and sat down. Then they turned the lights off on everyone 10 minutes before close to let their customers know they were not wanted. This store desperately needs a leader present to set a proper tone.
3222;Horrible customer service. Came in as a group around 7AM and the person who took our order was super rude. I couldn't get her name since she covered her name tag (she was cross eyed). I ordered a small iced coffee with 4 sugar and she said, in a snarky rude way, that the sugar will catch up to me in old age and that I do not need that much sugar. On top of that she didn't let my friend order with me despite the fact that we came together. She made him go back to the line and wait his turn when he literally came in with us.
3223;This place is inside Walmart, and since there are no seats anywhere near Walmart it is always packed.Last week we tried to get Gingerfrost Milkshakes, but the ice cream machine was broken.We returned this weekend, and ordered the same thing, it was nasty, the person making them had no idea how to, the shake tasted mostly like vanilla, but there were tastes of strawberry, chocolate (pretty much any leftovers they had).Certainly not like the Gingerfrost shake we had at another McDonalds.If you can find a seat, it's a decent place for a coffee.
3224;Hit or miss. Sometimes the food is great but sometimes it's well below average. I wouldn't recommend this BP to anyone. How can they mess up something as simple as a cookie with ice cream???? They have me about a 1/4 scoop of ice cream and when asked to correct their mistake I noticed they had charged me extra. Sometimes I go their and I get a proper serving other times I get a spoonful. Extremely disappointing given the price of their food. Will not be returning.
3225;Came to this location with my School and I am unsatisfied with the service that I received. We received 2 pizzas in 20 minutes. Thumbs down.
3226;If I could give this place less than one than I would. They served me rottening coleslaw. It smelled so bad I thought that I was going to be sick. I will never eat here again.
3227;HORRIBLY slow and rude service.Team came in for lunch around 1pm after two early morning Sunday games, kids were hungry.   We were seated immediately (the restaurant only had a few customers).  Came to get drink orders after about 20 minutes.  Drink orders CAME almost an HOUR after (now 1:20 minutes had passed).  It was another 20 minutes AFTER that they we were even given menus to look at (1:40)!!!!  Kids orders were taken shortly after that (2 hours).  And that was just the kids!! Adult orders were taken just before the kids food came out!!  After all was said and done they even forgot to ring in the 15% discount the team was supposed to receive.  We were just happy to get out of there.Waitress was rude, although clearly they were understaffed and she was overwhelmed.  No help from other staff or manager. The manager did manage to come by after 2 hours had passed.. We were told repeatedly they were not expecting us?!?!  What???  The restaurant was not even full... which seem to mean that they were not e
3228;Everything is expensive for no reason. The food is incredibly mediocre with high prices. I could feed my entire family with the cost it takes to eat here once alone. There are definitely better pizza places.
3229;2nd time in a row bad Boston Pizza experience. Lost orders, wrong bill, slow service. Should know better to go here by now. Mr Treliving's book was on display though.  Lately BP has gone downhill, last two experiences haven't been good. Usually a decent enough place if on the road and need something unchallenging.  (Nov 2012)
3230;What a Hair Day!Boston pizza! What a great place to bring the family / but not this day I went..I had dinner with the family at this location and found hair in my dinner.. Not just once? Not twice but 3 times!! So this is my dinner when I got in.So 2 drinks to start and meat bites : so the server came with the starter now my wife didn't tell me there was an eyelash on the dish " because it was on the side of the dish" ok now the server came with our 2 main orders / me "the smoke meat" wife "the shrimp tacos" so now guess what? I found an eyelash in the pickle : told the server she got another dish / in the mean time we had the shrimp taco : half way done she picked up the last taco and another hair under the thing.. "Maybe eyebrow hair it was small.." Ok the server took the plate away / and that's when the wife finally told guess what I didn't want to say anything but the first dish had a small hair lol / ppl check your food!!!I was just charged the chicken bites and drinks : I didn't Have pay the 2 
3231;The menu is changed new items looks good but tasted awful! I ordered pizzaburgers the meat was raw it was really gross! I hope i dont get sick from it!  The service was slower than usual! This place sux fo real
3232;I have had the misfortune of eating here on too many occasions because its near my friends house. The food on the images look good but they taste bad. To sum up their food I would just say they simply try to add flavor by adding tons of either sugar, fat, or salt.Pizza- oily(not in the good way) and doesnt taste good. I really dont know what else to talk about, the food just taste bad. Pasta- it tasted like they simply added milk and some pepper, and it cost like 17 dollars, sighCustomer service is bad - one time I called and the lady seem surprised that I was ordering, then she lied to me about a flavor, I asked if it was a little sweet and I basically got a lollipop on a bone -_-I could go on but why waste your time  Price -  this is an expensive place but the food does not match the price
3233;We ordered for takeout and purchased a large Caesar salad and a spinach dip. The Caesar salads portion was great but it didn't come assembled. 7 different compartments to open and add to make the salad. The spinach dip was awful, lacked spinach, was very watery and overall visually unappealing. The container it came in was also only a quarter full so the portion was horrible. The chips were extremely stale but the pita was good. Overall, we will not be coming back.
3234;The Swiss chalet on west drive is crap. Every experience we have had there is terrible. I love Swiss chalet but the servers here at this location are rude and mean. I always go to the Bovaird or Airport road locations when I want Swiss Chalet. Don't go to this one service is 0 and food maybe a 1 out of 10.
3235;First off, let me say that I love Swiss Chalet as a restaurant. It's actually my favourite place to eat because I grew up eating there (at the old Brampton location, over the bridge from this location - which was WAY cooler because it had all that wood work decor) but I now live in the States, so I only get to eat here once or twice a year.This review is solely about this location.Yesterday (Jan 2016) my family visited this location and sat down to have a weekend lunch time meal. There was a small crowd when we arrived (less than 50 people in the restaurant). We requested a table for 5 adults and one baby (high chair). We were asked if we wanted a booth with a high chair - to which my party asked if 5 adults would fit in a booth. They quickly changed their plans ("oh, 5 adults?") and showed us to a table set for 5 adults and a kids menu. No problem. I held my 2 year old daughter and waited for the high chair to arrive. After about 2 minutes of standing and waiting, my mother decided she would just go 
3236;Used to like Swiss Chalet. This place is a travesty. It took ages to get seated, they mixed up our orders, and the food was stone cold when it finally arrived.  Our waitress was an older lady who told us to our face that she couldn't wait for her Christmas break from the restaurant. I can understood how she felt, but I'm not sure a server should be telling customers she can't wait to get out of the place. To her credit, when we pointed out the fries were stone cold, she brought out new ones, but she must have known how long they'd been sitting under the lamps, surely? All in all, the entire place felt like a person who dislikes what they're doing for a living, and is just going through the motions. Maybe it's just this location, but if the issues are widespread, this Canadian institution is heading in the wrong direction.
3237;I'm not surprised this location has such poor reviews. It is literally the worst Swiss Chalet I have ever been to. The worst!Let's go through the deficiencies:1. Poor service - We waited about ten minutes at the front for a host to seat us. It was not busy. The problem was no one was checking the front. It took about 15 minutes for our server to take our drink orders (by that time we were ready to order so we did that at the same time). It took about 45 minutes to get our food. Again, they were not busy! Our server never checked in to see how things were. And it took about 20 minutes of us sitting in front of empty plates for our server to finally come over and ask whether we wanted dessert or the cheque. 2. Burnt ribs - The photo of the burnt rib from one of the other reviewers is spot-on. That's what my ribs looked like. Meat? Nope. Charcoal more like. Ribs should not be dry, desiccated and crispy with overall blackened surfaces. WTF are you guys doing to these ribs? Stop it!3. Crappy wings - We tri
3238;My luck for restaurants suck lately! Burnt ribs, dry chicken, gross fries! I am not impressed anymore :( maybe my standards for spending $50 is high but really? Not impressed they are serving dried chicken and this is what Swiss Chalet is known for!! Embarrassed for you!  I tried talking to the manager but he was a useless tit if I'm allowed to write tit lol
3239;Fries were great, as usual. I had a craving for their delicious, fall off the bone ribs so I paid the big bucks and had the quarter chicken & half rack of back ribs combo. The ribs were overcooked and tough while the chicken was tiny. My wife's chicken parmesan and daughters chicken strips were also overcooked. Our order was taken promptly but we waited forever for the food. Arrived at the restaurant at 6:15 and barely made it to an 8:00 show at the theater 10 minutes away. I've had takeout from here and never had issues. Probably won't dine in again.
3240;It was my first time here, and the staff was not helpful at all. In all honesty, they seemed miserable at their job. I'm not even sure what I ordered, but the portions were small and the rice and curry were watery. Never again!
3241;Atrocious on almost all levels. Complete apathy of service, almost borderline rude. Food was sub par, my usual favorite dish of Matar Paneer was almost inedible I threw most of it away. I would mention pricing but honestly if the food was good I wouldn't be too upset but $20+ for a terrible meal isn't good value. Change your attitudes and your chefs.
3242;HATE IT. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID. I got the curry bowl (butter chicken and rice) for $9 in a small container. What was even more ridiculous was a piece of naan costed $2.75. I cancelled the naan and ended up paying 10 bucks for just a small container of food. I should have gone to subway and easily enjoyed a combo for $9. Nevermind all of that, the employee on cash was giving me attitude for asking why a piece of naan was so expensive. He was on his phone while I paid and did not acknowledge me after that. Horrible customer service.  My mom cooks better indian food than this. Even the Indian food on Gerrard st is cheaper and tastier than this place. If anyone rates this place more than two stars, they do not know real Indian food! NEVER GOING BACK. Complete waste of money!!!!!!!!
3243;I should have avoided this place given all the poor reviews, but I was given a free $20 Wagjag voucher for this place, so I decided why not give it a chance?  Big mistake.So the voucher said this on it (I still have the electronic copy so this is verbatim):- Limit 1 voucher per visit- Valid only at the location selected (Yorkdale Mall: 3401 Dufferin Street)- Not valid with other promotions- Must print voucher and present at time of visit. Electronic vouchers are not accepted- Does not include tax or gratuity. No cash value. No cash backI always read the fine print and nowhere did it say that you must order from the dinner menu and that you cannot order from the lunch menu.So I was there at lunch time with my parents.  So I ordered from the lunch menu.  We ordered an order of Butter Chicken, an order of Masala Lime Lamb, and an order of Amaya Prawns.  When I went to pay (we were doing takeout so it was shortly after ordering), the cashier charged me the dinner prices which were $4 more for each plat
3244;Worst place to eat. Staff is extremely rude. I don't know what the owner is doing with this place. They should shut down and teach their staff some manners first.
3245;I hate the guys who are working there, before I never miss to have something to eat on Amaya in Eton centre, I like there , and I like there service, but I don't like Amaya on Yorkdale mall, the guys are rude, they don't talk polite and they show costumers attitude, I don't wish to go there anymore, and I advice to my friends don't try Amaya on Yorkdale
3246;Terrible and Inconsistent.  Been there 3 times.  I tried to like this place and gave it a chance.  The 1st time was ok.  The 2nd time the service was terrible with the hard sell to buy the more expensive options on the menu.  The 3rd time they tried to rip me off!!  Unbelievable, in this day and age, especially at Yorkdale mall.   $8.50 for a roti is a fair price but when the server only gave me a single teaspoon of topping on a huge bread roti that's when I said stop.  Serious rip off.  Complained and walked out... so did the couple behind me after witnessing what had happened. The servers looked stunned but what did they expect.  These people need to learn customer service Canadian style.  I would avoid them for a few months until they get their act together.
3247;Wouldnt give the mall discount to me (despite working at the office building) when literally every other food court restaurant that offered the discount would. Chicken Madras was extremely salty and dry even though it was drenched in sauce. No wonder this place is empty most of the time.
3248;I read the reviews before trying, and the reviews are accurate. Weird, rude, unhelpful workers. Over priced. My naan bread was burnt so I only ate 80% of it.  I got naan instead of rice and I asked it was an extra charge, worker just shrugged their shoulders. Samosas were cold but flavourful. Butter chicken was ok but the chicken was overcooked.
3249;The guy is so weird and disrespectful, I ordered a single plate of Samomsa which comes with 2 samosa's and than gave me 2 plates and he kept saying no you ordered 2 plates and you have to pay for it.
3250;This place is worst in customer service. My bread was cold and I asked the server to replace it. He gave me a cold look and told me that this is how it's supposed to be and was very rude to me. I had an argument with him that he cannot talk with me like that and instead he threatened me to call security. When I asked to refund my order as I didn'twant to eat now with that mood, he told me that cannot happen and I do whatever I can.I would strongly suggest anyone to stay out of Amaya. There are far better Indian restaurants who knows how treat their customers.By the way, I got back there again to ask the person's name (I think his name is Sohal- manager of that franchise). This person was again super rude and it looked as he would physically hurt me.I think this person has some serious issues. Please go to this franchise at your own risk.
3251;I wish I had seen these reviews before choosing to  eat Amaya Express.Service: AWFUL. The people working at Amaya were very rude. The man I ordered from was impatient and curt, and the cashier was rude - I paid with an AMEX card (which didn't tap when we both tried, leading her to tell me to insert it into the machine), and once it went through, she waved a little sign placed at the side of the cash register saying that they don't accept AMEX. Um, I didn't see it, AND she even held my card and tried to tap it giving her the opportunity to see it was an AMEX. Food: Okay. As others have said, nothing special. Avoid this place altogether.
3252;Flavourless, not fresh, buffet style food. I wish I saw the reviews on here because I just wasted $15 on what was a 4 veg option that you would usually get at any restaurant for under $10 and at least it's fresh. They charged me extra for not taking the Chana masala which made no sense. Plus the naan isn't real Indian naan. Prices should be 1/2 the price for what they are dishing out.
3253;When I pointed out that they had given me the wrong dish, they tried to force me to take it instead of correcting the order. Incredibly rude service and the manager bizarrely made no attempt to correct his employee's error or try to make it right. As it turned out, the food is quite poor (even though it looks very tasty) and it is best to avoid this place if you want to avoid a disappointing dining experience.
3254;I had been to Amaya the Indian Room on Bayview Ave and was really impressed by the food there. Foolishly thought that, despite the mall setting, an established restaurant like that would want to preserve its reputation by serving at least half-decent fare. I ordered the Masala Lime Lamb curry bowl and at first bite, immediately regretted spending my hard-earned cash on Amaya instead of, say, the KFC located in the same food court. Bland as hell and totally devoid of even a hint of spiciness. I wasn't expecting flagship restaurant standards but c'mon! I've had much better food from shady-looking Indian buffet places on Gerrard St. The lack of customers in an otherwise very busy food court should've tipped me off. If you're a fan of Indian food, avoid this place like a plague.
3255;Apparently they are no longer open for dinner. Haven't updated website. Don't answer the phone. Don't advise you they're not open, even if you make a reservation. Circling the drain, if they're not already completely closed down.
3256;Not even worth a star...Even with 50% off the food was not worth more than a dollar. Are you intentionally trying to make bad food? I ordered your pasta and it came raw. The actual pasta was completely raw, almost like you left in like warm water and gave up. The pizza or sloppy toppings on a pita bread was 20$.. delisso pizza looks gourmet next to this cold garbage you served me. Stop serving food, read your reviews and realize you need to either close or change ur "cook". Brutal.
3257;Place was dead....sat night and noone was in there.  Maybe 15 ppl?! Music was live until ppl showed up, then the dj strted playing sleepy r&b music. Drinks are $9 each. Extremely overpriced! Would never go again!
3258;We had a travelzoo voucher. The server did not show up until 6PM so the cook was trying his best to take our order. The restaurants was dark and full of flies, including one that ended up in my wine. The food wasn't great. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
3259;You get what you paid for, and in this case even less.Ordered from Just-eat, Stori was offering half price on their menu items.  I was intrigued to try the place because it just such a deal.  What a complete disappointment the entire night became.  The order was delivered timely, however incorrect.  They send 2 pizzas when I had ordered 1 pizza and 1 salad.  Okay that happens, I get it.  We quickly called the restaurant and the lady addressed us saying they would make the salad and send the driver to deliver it in a few minutes.  Also she said, don't eat the pizza, the driver will take it back.  Okay, sure that works for me, though you delivered something wrong and tell me not to eat it, what you plan to do with a cold pizza that someone possibly touched, I have no idea.We waited and an hour  passes, nothing. We call 3 times over the next half hour and they're intentionally not picking up.  We finally call just-eat which calls Stori and they tell us the restaurant will make our salad and deliver it righ
3260;this place lacks integrity.  not only is it sly but i would never come back.  lef me paint a picture... my group of friends come and they say its 15 dollars at the door but they only take cash so we hoto the bank and came back 5mins latrr they say its 30$so we zaid forget it..then they change theif mind again and say its 15.  i give the girl 20 and she doesnt even give me change back and i ask hed its 15 wheres my change and she snickers.what the hell kind of bullshit con scheme is this? then we go in and no ones in the damn place its already 1230.  no wonder they try and charge extta trying to treat us like fools.you get inside i order a run and coke and vodka soda.  so watered down i do t even taste any alcohol.  guess how much..18$ not including tip.two shots 20$ are u fucking kidding me.evedyghing ab this place is aweful.i give zero stars.  no integrity
3261;Very small. Rude staff. Not busy. Off the path location. We went on a Saturday night and were held in the line up past the time of free cover so the photographer could take photos to make the place look busy although nobody was inside and we had guest list.Would not recommend and definitely will not return.
3262;This place is downright awful. We had a reservation at 830 and they made us wait half an hour for our table - we did get a complimentary drink which was nice though.  Once we did get seated we got a rude waitress that looked like she just rolled out of bed and was not dressed the part. And from 8:30 - 11PM all we got served was our appetizer !! Not acceptable. And of course during that time they were turning the place into a "club" and cranking up the music so we couldn't even hear eachother. Plus the place is so dark so if you have poor vision you're out of luck. We said we just wanted to leave and to forget about our entree but she said it would be ready within 10 minutes. 30 minutes later we had it and it was cold and not very good at all. And the poor couple beside us was there for their 2 year wedding anniversary and they were just told to leave because they were converting the place to a club! Bottom line don't waste your time - this place will be closed down within no time.
3263;This place has dishonorable people running the show. They delivered my food an hour and fifteen minutes late (total time 2h15m after ordering) and after calling back and forth five times, I was told that I would get a refund for the cold and late food and received an apology. I ordered it through Just-eat.ca. I called Just-eat back 2 business days later (placed the order Saturday 12am) on Wednesday afternoon and the just-eat rep patched me through to the restaurant.  The guy representing Stori was rude, obnoxious and lacked a basic understanding of customer service. He refused to provide a refund, his justification was that I was calling back on Wednesday despite ordering on a Saturday and that because I didn't have the name of the restaurant rep who promised the refund, he wasn't going to issue it. Besides losing his temper and telling me how the restaurant business is run (clearly he had no idea as seen from his ape like mannerisms) he cut the phone on me. The just-eat rep who was on the line for the entire
3264;Worst restaurant experience ever!! Don't go there for brunch at least!! We went there for a Sunday brunch, the place is nice great location and cute decoration but the service is really bad and terrible food, when we arrived, there were a total of 6 people in the whole restaurant, the waitress was running like a chicken with the head cut off, but accomplishing nothing, not to be mean but I had stand up and ask for everything starting for menus, witch they didn't have menus, we never got what we asked for, and they basically brought a "sample" of everything they had, including frozen eggos sold as "waffles" so long story short, it's not a buffet brunch, it's a we'll bring you whatever we have left over in the kitchen bunch...
3265;If i could give this place 0 stars I would. I went here with my best friend last night and I will NEVER be back. They charge a $20 cover on a monday night and the staff are extremely rude and act like theyre better than everyone. If you are white dont bother coming here because they will treat you worse than the dirt on the ground. We werent allowed to hold our jackets, they made us pay for coat check. We didnt even get to dance to one single song because everyone kept yelling at us for no reason. telling us where we could and couldnt stand. hell if you even so much as breathe they have an issue. we tried to dance to a song we liked and the staff gave us an eye like we were doing something wrong and then the one bouncer shakes his head at us. right after that some prick tells me to get a grip on my friend... what shes having too much fun for you bro? all she was doing was dancing and not harming anyone. Then some girls boyfriend yelled at us because i guess we were dancing too close to him (his girlfriend was
3266;Totally useless business. Was on a trip to Toronto city and found this place. I was so excited to try sugarcane juice after a long time but had horrible experience. I Went inside to pay and by the time came out the juice was given to me in a cup. It felt impossible to make one glass juice in less than a minute. I asked the girl outside if the juice was fresh and she said that she just squeezed it.  Well it didn't taste fresh. Went back and returned the juice. The owner had courage to say that it was fresh (he was sitting inside) and didn't even offer any apology or courtesy to change it. Just trashed the juice in front of him and walked away. Too bad..I would not even give 1 star to this place
3267;This place gave me paancreatic cancer. It took forever for the guy to prepare the tea. It  doesn't taste like tea for the record. Do not visit!
3268;So just got ripped off.  Took my American money at par, gives me change in Canadian. What the @?*#:#. He even had the oddacity to tell me smugly that is what he always does. Time to learn how to do business in Canada!
3269;They have updated the place since I last visited which is plus. On the negative side, the food preparation was slow and they gave me the wrong order. Considering I did not visit during the lunch/dinner rush, this should not be the case. It took them almost 15-20 minutes to prepare the original order. Which, IMO, is not fast food. The worst thing about this location was the fact that there are beggars (yes!) that roam freely and the management does nothing about it. I have rarely seen a beggar in Toronto or Canada and yet they found a way to make it here. Not acceptable!I will go here for convenience and take out as the worst case scenario. Otherwise, me thinks not!
3270;Yes, it's burger king, what's worse is the smell that never seems to leave the area where you pick up your food and where you get your drinks. For years it has smelled like someone threw up.
3271;Aside from being sketchy, they ran out of all dipping sauces...That level of poor planning is unacceptable at the best of times, but when you know a promotion is coming, come on.  That's amateur.People don't come here for the charming atmosphere, they come here to have it their way, right away.One star!
3272;The staff here must hate their job.   Edna the general manager appears lost and over whelmed with the duties.  The shop is dirty and they do not provide napkins with meals.  This will be short and sweet. Stay away and not worth your hassels here. P
3273;Sorry, Burger King at 243 Yonge Street near the Eaton Centre, but you are just not trying hard enough.  Maybe your staff are too bored to take pride in their work.  I don't know.Lineups are long and move slowly.  As usual in fast food places, there are lots of empty tables, none of which have been wiped.I have been in here a few times and it is the same every time:First, a filthy guy comes in from the street to my table and asks me for money "for food".  When I refuse, he becomes angry and goes to the next table.  They refuse and he curses at them and continues.I didn't get a chance to tell him that that he can go to any one of several charities like the Salvation Army and get home made food three times a day every day of the week.  Better food than I can afford.  But he knows that already.  BK staff are wandering around but pretend they don't see him.Next, a supposedly deaf person comes in from the street and throws a card down on my table (which I consider my personal space during the time I am ea
3274;Obviously you cannot expect much from a Burger King - it is what it is. But this location hits ALL the bad points on anyone's list.The food is not fresh, some of the customers are sketchy (to say the least) and it is filthy.The Good:1. Location. It's centrally located downtown across from the Eaton Centre - since there is no BK in the EC.The Bad:1. Filthy. Nothing is more of a turn off than a dirty resto - no matter what price you're paying for the food.2. Food. The food here has most definitely been sitting out for far too long.3. Clientele. Being that it is so central, there is a lot of unsavory individuals dining/using the washroom here.Recommendation: stay away!
3275;I end up going to this location once in a while because of where it is.  In the last week I have been here twice and I will never go back.Both times I was served by the same woman.  Each time she was polite to me.  But rude to every customer of colour.Next, the washroom is never available when I am there.
3276;So I'm starting my review while I wait in line for a fast food restaurant. You would think that if you have a line of more than a dozen customers you would open up more than 1 cash register. It only took 15 minutes and another dozen to show up before they decide to open up the 2nd register. Not to mention a homeless women decides to cut through the whole line and the staff seemed to be fine that it happened. The staff were unable to handle the situation as the homeless women decided to be messing around in the condiments area. Management was kinda unprofessional on how she was speaking to the homeless women. The nuggets that I ordered were kinda dry and small. I was not too impressed. Although they did have all selections of dipping sauces that another Burger King did not have as they were running out. Only thing that kept me coming back was the 10 nuggets for $1.79 deal. Jimstar Out!
3277;This review is for wing machine, and since there are no separate reviews for it, and ginos pizza is affiliated with it, sorry but I am never coming here again. I ordered a pound wings and wedges on the side. My whole order was wrong!!! The guy probably misheard me and gave me veggies instead... and I asked for some sauce put on the wings, and well... I got no sauce. Just plain buffalo wings. Like if you are confused or don't remember the order, just ask! And it's my fault for not realizing it until I got home because I was in a rush... the wing machine at yonge and eglinton is way better but I don't work around that area anymore :/
3278;The taste of the pizza may have been tainted by the rudeness of the delivery driver who was so rude there was no way I could enjoy my pizza after that experience.  After almost knocking me over while handing me my pizza he grumbled under his breath when I asked for change, dropped some of my change on the front step, and walked way without saying a word.  It was so weird... would not order again because the pizza was also pretty tasteless.
3279;Sam (the phone operator) has provided the worst customer service because he is discriminating against me because I am not from Canada & do not have a Canadian phone number.  He refused to take my order. NEVER ORDER FROM THIS ESTABLISHMENT and DO NOT Support Discrimination.
3280;Stopped by on my way home, you know the drill, had a few drinks, looking for a slice to soak up the suds. I had their spinach pizza, with sundried tomatoes and feta. I used to think the benchmark of poor was Pizza Pizza, especially since we have so many other options in TO. That said Pizza PIzza was way better than this. My Gino's slice was literally like cardboard. Would not go back again.
3281;HORRIBLE HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! Forgot part of our order and when we asked for it to be delivered they confirmed and after waiting for almost 2 hours they tell us that no they won't deliver it anyone. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER
3282;When i was a kid i used to come here and it was my favorite pizza place to go to. Prices were decent and I was pretty much their first customer when they first opened back in early 2000s. Recently i had a chance of stopping by this location and I was disappointed. What happened?! I ordered a Hawaiian Slice and it tasted... not as I had 4 years back. The crust tasted really old and overall it was REALLY BAD! Customer Service was horrible too. The minute i walked in the employee was talking on the phone and her clearly saw me come in and I waited I had to wait 5 minutes for him to take my order. Never coming here again! Childhood ruined forever. Bad Pizza, horrible service.
3283;Poor customer service.  Staff are rude / display attitude / have poor tone with customers. When paying, the staff member tried to put in an amount directly into the debit machine without ringing it on the register.  When I asked "how much?" and looked at the screen to indicate I was waiting for him to properly ring it in (the amount he put into the debit machine was wrong sure enough), he (had glasses on) acted as if I was the problem and then passed me onto another cashier, who I then needed to remind that my order was to go and ask for a bag 3 times before she'd give me one.
3284;If you're going to be /that/ rude, forget it. I didn't even go through with a purchase. F that noise.
3285;I wish I could give this place a negative rating. The customer service here is awful! They treat their customers like garbage. In all honesty, their food is not that great either. Their poor service extends to all locations. I've seen men working there heckle at females as they walk by. Most of the people working there have accents so when you ask them to repeat what they said, they start yelling at you! I've never encountered poorer customer service. Just awful!
3286;The customer service is absolutely ridiculous. I agree with the person below who gave a low rating. The short, old man mumbles and pretty much whispers when he speaks. He also got frustrated when I asked him to repeat himself literally at least 3-5x for every sentence he said. It's not my fault you don't know how to speak up. They also gave me a very crappy portion of meat (half a serving) and the idiot gave me plain lettuce as coleslaw. I said it's not coleslaw... It's plain lettuce and he insisted it is. He also did it to the customer behind me and she gave me a "wtf" look. $11 for shitty service and 10 lbs of salt on the potatoes and meat, a tiny drop of sauce and lettuce for plain "coleslaw" is not worth the $11. Go somewhere else to get shawarma. You are saving your money this way smfh. I gave them the benefit of the doubt for the constant absence of customers assuming it was due to the prices, but now I understand why. STAY AWAY FROM HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY OR BE SERVED BY PEOPLE WHO DO
3287;Higher prices, smaller portions, less salad choices than the very excellent 7 King E. location. Staff gets ruder as you go down the line, it's as if they stop caring once you're fully hooked into paying. Didn't offer dressing on salad or the free pita that comes with the plate - one of those 'you snooze you lose' type places.Last but not least, saw an employee scrape the uneaten portion of his rice back into the rice tray. Fucking Gross.
3288;Getting a salad is the same price as elsewhere but you can only get 2 toppings -- whereas most other places you get 4-6. 2 vegetables on a plate is not a meal or filling. The tabbouli had very little flavor too -- more like just parsley then the refreshing, lemony dish you normally get. For the quality of food you get, turns out to be overpriced. Don't eat here. There are much better options right next to it.
3289;Terrible customer service and sub par food. The men behind the counter mumbles when speaking to you and make it obvious that they don't want to be there (all of them wear a frown). They don't wait for you reply even though they asked and just start filling your plate with stuff you don't want. The food taste the worse compared to all the other villa madinas that I have visited. Not tasty and flavorful at all. They are also so stingy with the garlic sauce. They don't give it to you unless you ask and then it's just a dollop of it in the size of a dime. Won't be coming back to this awful place. The one star is for the girl next to the cash area.  She was nice.
3290;I have ordered kefta (kinda like meatball) it was one of the worst meatball i ate. I dont consider myself as a picky person. I rarely leave food on the plate but this was really bad i didnt even took a second bite. Then i realise this is the reason they ask to put tahini and hot sauce on the meat since meat itself has no taste at all. Girlfriend ordered chicken, it was relatively better than mine but it was dry. I'll never eat from this place again...
3291;I thru up every time I eat from Villa Madina. And I once got a food poisoning from the one that's at 7 King St E
3292;Average food, but the employees are scam-artists.  It's a hit and miss with this restaurant. If you order to go, you will get scammed. Me and my colleagues decided to order to go one time and when we opened the food up, we knew we had been scammed. it was 80% potatoes and rice, 10% meat and 10% veggies. Very unsatisfying that we had to find something else to eat. I would not recommend eating at the Eaton center Urban eatery branch to any one as there are much better authentic, honest Middle eastern restaurants within the vicinity.
3293;I usually come to this place when in the Eaton Centre but I was so put off the last time there by their rudeness I will never go back.  I decided to try out the place next door but they had run out of the generic glasses every food establishment in the food court uses (they are not specific to each establishment).  I asked Villa Medina if I could use one of theirs and the tall guy working there was SO rude about it I was shocked!  I told him I was a regular customer but wouldn't eat there again due to his attitude and he literally said "I don't care, go".  All over a plastic cup that EACH establishment has the same!!!  They're not even branded!  This was such HORRIBLE customer service I couldn't believe it.  If you don't want to give out a cup for whatever reason, fine but you're still representing your company so don't be rude and belligerent while declining the person.  Completely unprofessional.
3294;Ordered Blizzards for the family, I noticed they did not turn them upside down. I advised them that it's advertised that if it's not done, they should be free. Was brazenly told that's not applicable in Canada. I showed them the ad from Dairy Queen Canada and the writing on the actual Blizzard cup....still No! With no manager to speak to it just fell on deaf ears. I will avoid ordering at this location until they get with the program.
3295;I very much regret coming to the DQ to satisfy my late night craving for some sugary dessert........Came on Saturday night and the place was pretty much empty, should have taken it as the sign to leave because the food was absolutely awful. We ordered a Cookie Dough Blizzard, Chocolate Dipped Cone, and Fudge Stuffed Chocolate Chip Cookie. Well let me tell you, with the exception of the Cone, the other items did not look appetizing at all and greatly deviated from the advertised picture on the menu. The Blizzard looked like a pile of goo and didn't taste was good as McDonald's McFlurry, which is what I usually get, and I think it's pricier as well. However, the Cookie with Ice Cream took the cake being most nasty dessert I've had in a while. At a price point of $5.99 I was expecting something like a restaurant grade dessert, or at least it should stay true to the picture. But nope, what was handed to me was a plate of abomination. I watched as the guy was preparing the cookie. It was pretty much reheated
3296;They prefer white people, everytime they get the white people's food quick and fast and point out where the condiments are, when a coloured person goes there they make sure they take extra long and get the order wrong, some long haired dude making the food along with the staff are friendly to every patron when leaving except the coloured people who are watched like they are going to steal, avoid if your not white
3297;I would've given no stars if I had the choice.  It was my kid's birthday and just so happens we received a coupon for $3 off their ice cream cakes over $35.  I opened up the coupon from the email from my phone to see what the coupon was about but then after I opened it once it gave a message to tell me that it's no longer available because I've printed it.  I went to the store to explain the situation but they would not care at all.  They inquired with the manager at the back and the manager, Linda, did not even bother to come out to speak to me.  It's not about the $3, I couldn't care less.  It is the principle.  If your system is set up to allow customers to only be able to open the coupon once then first of all give a warning.  Secondly, the email did not even mention what the coupon was about so one has to open the coupon to see what it is.  Will go baskin robins for my ice cream cake instead.
3298;We ordered 2 piece french toast, the vegetable omelette and 3 eggs with no meat. It took about 10 minutes before the food came. The server checked on us once. I discovered pieces of ham in my vegetable omelette, and I informed the server. She took it to her manager , and came back with 'We will not do anything about it. There is no way we would put ham in it.'  No empathy or sorry, no basic customer service was demonstrated. If you have a food restriction due to dietary or religious beliefs. Be cautious!!
3299;This Sunset Grill opened recently at a good location for me. I have been to other Sunset Grill restaurants throughout Toronto, so I know what to expect from it. Although the Sunset Grill franchises are in general an "all right" place to go to, you have to even further lower the expectations on this one. Food is not what I'm used to (except for the bacon, I find their bacon has always lacked in quality, and it was the same on this restaurant), the service was non-familiar and waiters walked around with a blank face like they are serving jail time instead of working at a family breakfast place, and they tried to rush us out, plus the overall standard quality I have experienced in other franchises was totally missing here. I double checked the door sign upon exiting, to make sure we were on an actual Sunset Grill, instead of a horribly bad developed knock-off. Will not come back, I can find much better places to enjoy my weekend brunch.
3300;This is the worst experience I have ever had. We waited over two hours for food and it never came. Tables all around were leaving. The hostess never told anyone the kitchen was backed up when they were seating people nor did the servers before people ordered. We heard the waitresses all talking about lying to customers over how long food would be. We asked our server 3 times for an update on our food which was only an appetizer and each time she said she would check and never came back! They call them selves an Irish pub yet you can only get small glasses of Guiness. We asked to speak to the manager and then watched our server go chat with her colleagues instead of getting him. Customers were all agreeing with each other that the palace was terrible! We left after 2 hours and our app never came
3301;So...I feel bad. I had intended to review the food at lucky clover, except that after sitting there for almost 2 hours, my food had still not arrived. It was somewhat perplexing as the booths all around me were empty, and I had also quite simply ordered an appetizer to start with. On paper the prices are fairly average for food, with an initial interesting offering in terms of meal choices, along with your typical burgers, pasta, and steaks. I had intended on ordering the corned beef and cabbage but never got the chance due to the backlog with the appetizer. They offer small and large draft beers, along with pitchers, except the large beer size is only 16oz. $8.25 for Guinness.You will likely appreciate the decor a great deal as it's clear a lot of effort was put into the place it is also quite clear that they have desperately rushed their opening, which was disappointing. Plenty of staff around and yet insufficient attention given to the tables, with a kitchen that can't handle a basic load. I'm not sur
3302;Went here at 6:30 on a Thursday. Sat down, asked staff twice for a waiter/waitress to come over and left at 7 without someone even  coming to take our drink order.
3303;Wow.  Incredibly bad food, poor ambiance (set by weird music and a belligerent guest whom the bartenders were oblivious to), average to high prices...subpar would be an understatement.Had to send dinner back.  Waitresses were friendly (oddly dressed).  The decor was the one amazing thing.  Ornate, glossy marble floors and warm wood booths... good luck eating it though!
3304;The one star is for the decor, it really is a pity star.We just left from a dinner service and we less than impressed. No hot water in the bathroom! Cold air in the air dryer! Insane.Had fish and chips which we thought would be safe but it wasn't, shit fries. The creme brûlée was terrible as well, tasted and had the consistency of a snack pack pudding.Place needs to do some work and management needs to take a hard look at themselves to save this dive. Bet is closed next October.
3305;While I can understand being busy after a jays game you should still be able to provide good service. We had two identical sandwiches ordered at our table, One came out properly the second came without most of the fixings.  The answer we got was I can't do anything about it now and they were both billed fully at the end.   During the meal one of our guests finished their pop and was never offered another.  We had to flag down the server and tell them that we wanted one even though they can to the table many times. Overall service can be slow, mistakes can happen,  how you deal with it speak volumes on your location.
3306;Wow so funny I'm visiting Toronto from Miami and thought wow this place opened in Toronto that was in brickle downtown Miami what a joke not even close meanwhile I was told it's the owner of HOOPS which also was in Miami who failed terribly was sued by his landlord and ran back to Toronto what a joke the guy steals the name from a bar in Miami and tries to open it in Toronto good luck with that everyone will see True person behind it all which is just a failure
3307;Might be one of the worst pubs in the area.... nope, wait, Hoops is right around the corner! Soooo, am I surprised it's the same owners? Not so much. Food is terrible and they don't serve pints.... sorry, that's a lie as the waitress politely explained that they are American pints. I looked at her like she's an idiot. She smiled back at me, oblivious to how dumb the explanation was. Anyway, their US pints are the same cost that every other bar in the area charges for an actual big person beer. Don't bother with this place.  There's way more options around.
3308;The Lucky Clover is like getting to the end of the rainbow and finding out the pot of gold got replaced with burnt meat and overcooked eggs.The restaurant clearly took a lot of time with their decor, and have hired a large serving staff- although the music was pretty odd for the venue, and the mens bathroom had no toilet paper...We were a group of 5 heading in for breakfast/ early lunch. The restaurant was empty, yet food still took roughly 40 minutes to come out.We ordered the "irish Skillet" , soup of the day, brunch burger , spinach and goat cheese salad, and the lamb irish stew.Irish Skillet: over cooked eggs, sitting on top of completely cremated potatoes/ bacon/ sausages. If you like charcoal this is the dish for youSoup of the day: This was not even hot, it was room temperature , how do you mess up the soup of the day which probably is pre made in a large basin in the back..Brunch Burger: We sent the first one back because much like the sausage and bacon in the skillet, this one was cremated
3309;We were looking to try a new place out in the heart of downtown Toronto and we landed on Lucky Clover. I usually don't write reviews but I felt like I needed to warn others.We called in to see if they had availabilities and they said come on in we have tables. Really nice setup they had at the entrance but once we got there, we waited twenty minutes! That was probably the least of my concerns of the night.After we sat down, our server didn't even come back for at least another 20 minutes so we had to flag the hostess down again. Poor girl. We ordered wings with fries and pasta. My wife asked if she can have her pasta spicy and the server said no, but we can give you hot sauce on the side. And guess what, she never brought it out. Wings were unbelievably crispy. I felt like they forgot to take it out of the fryer. Worst part was my sister caught a mouse run through the restaurant. How disgusting. Their card machines weren't working. I had to use my visa on 3 different machines before they found one m
3310;Came in, was seated at a dirty table by two girls that looked like dominatrixes then waited 20+ minutes and nobody came by so we left. What a waste of time and reading the other reviews here it actually makes sense.
3311;While the food is decent, everything else about this restaurant is horrible. The service is lacklustre at best and the servers don't know what they're doing or how to give good customer service. Management is greedy and offer horrific service. It's understandable considering the place is so gaudy and ostentatious that they need to get money to afford it. The layout is stupid for a sports bar as you can hardly see the tv screens if you're in a booth. For a place that is rarely busy, you'd think service or food would be amazing because they have nothing but time. I fully expect this place to shut down and go out of business. They don't retain customers and I'd rather go somewhere further or pricier just to avoid them. Sad considering I live in the building. Highly do not recommend especially in the area. There are many other better places. I doubt I'll be returning.
3312;Ordered an extra-large gluten-free pizza through JustEat. Gino's sent us a 'normal' crust (I tested it by taking a little bite).So, we phoned Gino's, and the guy who answered said that they only make gluten-free crusts in medium, so he deliberately went ahead and made an extra-large normal pizza... which my guest couldn't eat. I mean, why else would we ever order gluten-free, right? Incredibly, this Gino's employee aggressively and repeatedly insisted on the phone that "this is your fault, not mine," declining to refund our $24.54. (He did phone earlier, you see, and even let it ring a few times, but didn't leave voice mail - the obvious next step being, send a gluten-crust to someone who specifically asked for the opposite). Anyway, now we're talking with JustEat, who are being much nicer than the angry guy who knowingly chose to make us the wrong pizza. JustEat says we're getting our money back after all. And Gino's is sending their driver to take their pizza back...
3313;We ordered veggie pizza for dinner tonight and the pizza tasted very bad. I really wanted to like the pizza but unfortunately the quality was so not fresh and tasted bad. The guy who picked up the phone knew nothing about the pizza deals they offer and we ended up paying more money. I asked for whole wheat pizza which they didn't have either. Only good thing was fast Delivery. Never ordering from here again. I would not recommend this pizza to anyone.
3314;I came in on a Tuesday during the extreme tasty Tuesday specials. The small is $5 the regular was 7 which is $0.50 off the regular price of $7.49. When I ask for the vegetables to put in my pita the clerk informed me that vegetables are extra charges.  That's crazy...  I go to pita place to avoid eating a burger,  but if you want a healthy vegetable, it's $0.50 cents extra.   In the end,  I paid over $9.00 with tax for just the pita...  No drink.The store is not at fault...  It's the corporate policy that is just stupidity when I can go to any other restaurant for equal or less money,  WITHOUT GETTING NICKEL AND DIMED.  Corporate... Learn something..
3315;Tried the Limited Edition Jerk Chicken Pita and it was one of the worst wraps I've had in my life.The staff was friendly--no problems there!But whoever gave the "ok" to sell this horrid wrap needs a Taste Testing asap.There is a reason why Jerk Sauce is COOKED/GRILLED or BAKED on chicken or pork. It's not the kind of sauce you dip or drizzle on food. The sauce was super spicy which I would normally love but absolutely no flavor other than bitterness. The thyme in the sauce was so potent it over powered the whole wrap.  It was literally grilled chicken and veggies with cold jerk sauce poured on top of it. Save your money! This is NOT a winner!
3316;Hmm 2nd visit wasn't so good.  I ordered the salmon bibimbap on quinoa.  First off, they didn't have any quinoa so had I order rice. I should also mention I came right at lunch opening so it's not that they had ran out, they just didn't have any although it's listed on their menu.  Secondly, the rice was cold and crusty. Lastly, the salmon was dry and rubbery.  Suffice to say I didn't enjoy it at all.    I am willing to give them another chance, as they say third time is the charm but perhaps I will steer clear of the bibimbap and try the bulgogi cheeseburger, solely for novelty purposes.
3317;Fine food? Really? I think NOT! Gave it 1 star based on the atmosphere but don't let the decor fool you. As it may look clean and new, the food here is definitely not fine. We ordered the chicken and beef. Both were served cold, in dry pitas with barely 2oz of chicken in one and maybe 3oz in the beef. What a ripoff! Never again. Terrible first impression on a grand opening. Save your money and take your appetite down the street to Liberty Schawarma.
3318;Got build your own bowl and it was TINY. Shape of the container is shallow and flat and not a bowl by any definition. There are very few toppings to choose from. My friend got a chicken shwarma and didn't want any of the toppings and asked if he could have rice instead. They said no. So he was given a flimsy tiny chicken shwarma for $8.50. And they were rude about it too. Would not recommend based on the people/service as well as poor value for portion sizes.
3319;Terrible service and flavourless. I keep trying to like Paramount as I am a big fan of how they run their business but the food and service is terrible. This is the second location that I've had a really awful experience with.I really want to like this company but I just don't think I can keep giving it chances.
3320;This is my 3rd time getting food from this location and let me tell you it is very different than other Paramount locations. I am extremely disappointed at their customer service, food and pace. Customer Service:The sales associates they have working there are really awkward, they just stare and some seem like they have no mannerisms. Today, the cashier forgot to charge me for chicken.. the manager came back and made him charge me $1.00 on my debit after i was about to leave to pay for the chicken. Where is the customer service in all of this? YOU forgot, I left and you had me come back :S What?!Food:I got the fatoush salad about 3 times since opening, today they forgot the pita chips AND the dressing. How the eff, do you forget the pita chips? Thats the main part of the salad. On top of that they serve the salad in a shallow plate - not even a bowl - literally 10 bites. Pace: They are not trained to work fast. When there is a rush hour, they work very slowly. After 1 PM - all 10 of them are just s
3321;LOVE Paramount - HATE this location! No saj wraps, limited meat selection. Nothing more frusterating than looking at their menu above, but didnt sell both of the items I wanted, with an explanation of "those didnt sell well here" If the menu was accurate I would return. skip this location!
3322;Very underwhelming. Chicken shawarma wrap was okay, mostly just tasted the pickles. Tabouli just tasted like a bowl of wet parsley, no flavour aside from plain parsley and water. Too bad.
3323;The food here is pretty good. But the portions are really small and the service was terrible. There was a manager/owner and employee behind the counter. The employee just did not seem happy to be there. Was pissed off the whole time he was taking and preparing the order. Unimpressed with the overall experience. Waste of prime Toronto real estate
3324;This was my first time in Paramount and this location. It wasn't as good as I expected from Lebanese food. I went there with my MealPal application subscription for lunch during day. Atmosphere is pleasant, style is right but I found the portions really small.. What surprised me was with Meal Pal we are supposed the get the same size portions but it wasn't so... especially the meat part, my beef shawarma was like half of what the regular customers got, so was very disappointed with the quantity... Taste was ok, although beef part looked kind of dry and there was just very little sauce. I wouldn't go there with my MealPal account for sure, if this restaurant wants to keep serving MealPal gals it should reconsider the amount they are preparing for them...
3325;Terrible value. Tiny portions and bland food make this place not worth the price. I miss the old middle eastern place at this location.
3326;Tiny portions, tastes horrible, and I was sick afterwards. Skip this place and go directly to Pamier Kabob a little south.
3327;I wish I could give them zero stars! Extremely bad service - went to get a beef shawarma so instead of giving the fresh and hot beef, they gave the beef from the tin cans they had previously cut and kept - when asked to be served the fresh beef they made a ridiculously big deal of it and involved other staff members who were equally rude and unaccommodating. The shawarma by the way tasted awful and just the two bites I had before leaving the rest made me feel queasy most of the afternoon
3328;What a waste of prime real estate. This is a failed attempt to make paramount a fast food place. It's only been open a week and already the food looks sad and the employees sadder. With pamier kebob not too far away and although their location isn't as fancy their food makes up for it. Couldn't recommend this place nor will I go back. This place could easily be the reason for upset stomach in the near future. Totally agree with other reviews talking about food from tins with brine. Nothing fine about this paramount location.
3329;I told the employee 3 times I want tahini and garlic, he put a shit load of hot sauce on my plate. I told him that was not what I want, he just walked away! Portion was tiny as well! What is wrong with this place!!!
3330;I'm a HUGE fan of the Paramount near the Eaton Centre, so when this place opened up near work, I was super excited.It's very disappointing.The bowls and plates are not generous. At the Yonge location, you can order way more than you can eat for so cheap. Here, not so much. Everything is very carefully measured out. Tt seems much more expensive.When they announced that they were opening here, I figured they'd be selling me lunch 4 or 5 times per work week, no question instead, I went twice and then never again. :-/
3331;Came on Saturday night this place was only only 1/5 seated. Waited for 10 min didn't even get the menu.
3332;Worst service ever! Waitress was very rude- she clearly didn't want to be there.. It took her 40 mins just to come near us so we could ask for a drink- and the place only had 2 other customers! Wings were OK, but not great, which took forever to come and they weren't even the right order when they finally came.. Will never visit this location again!
3333;This place is horrible. Went with a friend but wasn't very hungry so just ordered the mozzarella sticks. There were 4 tiny sticks and the price was $8.50!!! At more than $2 per mozzarella stick, they weren't even good! The service was terrible too...the waiter didn't come by once to check on us even though there were only three other tables there. When we finally asked for our bill, she took so long we just went up to pay. I wasn't going to give her more than a 10% tip, however, their machine does not allow you to select a tip amount less than 15%! So you are basically forced to pay 15% unless you pay cash! I didn't want to make a scene and just selected the 15% and left (which is exactly what they are trying to coerce you to do). I definitely won't be back, which is kind of disappointing since it is pretty much across the street from me. I have been here a few times and its always been a bit of a disappointment but this recent experience really sealed the deal. Hopefully a better restaurant replaces it.
3334;If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Everyone beware, we ordered take out for a party and when we opened the package at home only 2/3rds of the amount of wings we ordered were there. This place is an absolute joke. The wings they give you are tiny and they cheat you on order size. Even after calling the store to complain the owner got on the phone and rudely told us we were wrong and he was right.  We paid over $120 dollars and got 50 wings when we should of received 80. Save your hard earned money and get your wings from duffs or all star. Do not be scammed by this wild wings and the dishonest owner/management.
3335;Took 40 minutes to get our order of wings.  Only one waitress on Thursday night. Go to the other locations in the gta. This one is not worth the wait.
3336;Where's the chicken!If you enjoy deep fried bread, this is the place for you!  If you enjoy some form of meat on the chicken wings you order, this is not...
3337;SO. NOT. WORTH. IT. Omg. I was trying to decide whether or not this was gonna get 1 star, and ultimately decided to go for it. I don't even give 1 stars usually.First off, the place was rather quiet for a Wednesday night, but didn't really get much service. The server seated us, asked us for a beverage, and that was pretty much it. Other than coming back to take our order when waved down, she didn't do much. Second, the wings were tiny. I mean, TINY! I go for wings almost once a week, and have gotten used to the average size of a chicken wing. These wings they gave us were so small, they couldn't possibly be counted as 1 wing. Unfortunately, Wild Wing doesn't charge by weight, but by the number of wings. A single order is 9 wings at $12.99. With at least half of those wings being tiny, you definitely don't get your money's worth.I was even hungry after eating here! I have NEVER been hungry after going for wings! Sadly, the fries they served with their wings were crap, so I didn't even want to eat thos
3338;Every other Wild Wing I have been to has been 5 stars, but not this place. The wings had the bare minimum of sauce, when other locations have been soaked in sauce. They also almost forgot the veggies and dip and didn't even offer them over the phone (take out). I know it's not a big deal but we also got the cheap wipes with our food when I have always gotten the Wild Wing brand thick wet wipes from every other location. And last but not least, the staff wasn't very friendly - when I called the lady went "You know were the location next to dollarama right?"... Obviously I know which location I am calling.  Not much else to say about this location, except for the fact that I will not be returning.
3339;Overcookef and bland. Fries were soggy , service was slow and uncaring. Manager couldn't care less about what his customers thought. Never going again.
3340;Sucks to be the owner of this place. Sorry whoever you are!! So the staff here are completely rude!! Food isn't up to par either. This review is based on 4 visits not just one!!Too bad, I love wild wings but won't eat here ever again.
3341;Avoid this Filipino restaurant. I ordered sizzling sisig that was served cold and not freshly cooked. The food ruined my stomach. The menu must have been on the tray for hours and the heating system was below the right sustaining temperature. Thus, if you don't want to ruin your stomach...avoid this fastfood store...they serve crappy food!!!!
3342;We ordered an 80lb Lechon not cut but the day we picked it up the lechon felt like it was 30lbs. When we arrived at our party we cut the Lechon and realized that  there was barely any meat in the belly section of the Lechon which caused it to cave in. We were told at check out that even though it felt lighter it was because of the organs they took out. That was definitely not the only thing that was missing because all the meat was gone! I would definitely not recommend Bella's Lechon to anyone. I'm very disappointed.
3343;We ordered sisig and they told us it would be ready at 12:30. It was let ready till almost 2 pm and we needed it for a birthday party. The lady at cash didn't even care or apologize and was rude. I'll never go back there
3344;I agree with the other yelper:  Lechon is a hit and miss.  I had it today for lunch (Lechon platter) and it had the "malansa" taste.Also ordered the tocilog.  It looked and tasted not fresh.  It did not have the tocino taste at all.   The garlic fried rice needs more garlic oil.It is too bad that the food I had today sucked.  The service was attentive though.
3345;my friend ordered Bella's lechon for his daughter's bday. it was a big disappointment, hit and miss kind of thing. i wasnt around the time my friend ordered one so i havent mention him about my(-) experience with Bella's lechon. i could have sent him to one of the chinese bbq specialty restaurant. they ordered it and have it cut with extra charge....its better to order the whole lechon and not have it cut bec. you can see by the looks of the lechon if it is cook or not. the taste of the lechon is so "piggy"(me amoy)....in short, not recommended.
3346;Thought I would change it up from domino's. .. not sure why ordered online, got an email confirmation and no pizza never order from this location save your self the HANGER
3347;It took a full 90mins from the time I ordered until I had my pizza delivered, which was cold when it arrived. The driver left out part of my order and I spent 20mins on the phone trying to reach customer service to have him come back. I will never, ever, ever order from Pizza Hut again.
3348;Despite the reviews I thought to try myself because as a kid I always loved Pizza Hut pizza. Unfortunately both of the times I've ordered from this location I've been disappointed. The first time it was 30 minutes Late. This most recent time was worse. I ordered a basic pepperoni pizza, thin and crispy as they promote it. However, it was thin and soggy. The entire bottom slid my pizza was drenched in oil. It was not crispy, it was floppy and extremely soggy to the point all I could taste was oil. I took a pic to share. You'd think with all these bad reviews they would correct their errors.
3349;AWFUL! My delivery was 25 mins late. On top of that the driver refused to get out of his car  and deliver the pizza because he was afraid of getting a ticket. My friend and I walked around for 15 mins looking for him because he said he was waiting in the lobby, meanwhile he was sitting in his car.The pizza itself was cold and burnt. I couldn't believe how small the sizing is scaled - the large could feed maybe two people. Who aren't that hungry.I get that it's a new location but come on! The manager I called could barely speak English and kept repeating the same thing over and over until I finally hung up.Wow. Seriously. WOW.
3350;This pizza hut is just horrible because they always burn my toppings on the pizza which I don't understand why? so, I decided to order pasta instead but found a hair inside my pizza which is disgusting. I am not ordering from this location again.....
3351;Ordered the pizza online.Email confirmation on the price was $29.92 and when the food was delivered found that my card was charged $32.92. So the driver decided to steal an extra $3.00 from me. Tried to call the store and inform them of what happened but the store clerk put me on hold until I hung up (well over 9 mins). Tried calling head office but they directed me to call the store as every store handles their own customer service. LOL...Do yourself a favour next time you find yourself ordering from this store...don't.Sincerely Disappointed
3352;Done with you Pizza Hut. I order from this location somewhat regularly and I'm now just beyond over it. More often than not, delivery take 1-2 hours (if not more), and you can guarantee when it does, it will be cold. No discounts, apologies, free pizzas - zero f*cks given by this store. And if you call their location, you'll just get transferred to their general 1-800 number, where you'll sit on hold for 20 mins then get transferred back to the store, where they won't pick up. Pathetic. Done with you, your terrible service and your mediocre pizza. Would much rather give my money to any of the other 5769049202 pizza places in this city. Do yourself a favour and go anywhere else.
3353;Just close this one down. It is actually terrible. I have never made a yelp review before or even had an account. But i felt it was my responsibility as a fellow Toronto resident to warn all others.... 2 Hours+ waiting for deliver. No one picks up the phone. Main pizzahut line tried to transfer us to the store 4 times, no answer each time. Even the main customer service hotline said it was ridiculous. Apparently this specific branch handles its own customer service, which is apparently none, since they don't pick up. This isn't even the first time they've been late. Never ordering from this store again. Do yourself a favor and NEVER order from this specific store.Edit: So it finally arrived 130 minutes after the initial order. Customer service pizzahut told us it should be free, but the delivery man refused and said no free food. Just keeps getting better.
3354;Online order came 40 min later than told, pizza was cold. Their credit card machine wasn't working either...worst experience ever.
3355;Every time we order at this location something happens.  Usually orders are  (20-30min late) late, missing food...
3356;If I could give this location 0 Stars I would. Every time we order from this location something goes wrong. Either the order takes 2-3 hours for delivery or something is missing or its cold and gross. Don't even think about calling this location back and possibly cancelling or changing an order, they never pick up their phone!! I have requested to speak to the manager on several occasions and have never heard back.  This location is the absolute worst. Never order from them!
3357;I can't even with this place. I've actually given them multiple chances considering how close I live to their location. The first time we tried this franchise they took our order down wrong. I don't just mean that we called in. We walked over and repeated our order to the clerk 4 times. She still recorded it incorrectly. Needless to say, we were disappointed. In that same experience a gentleman came up to the counter to tell the clerk he just received his pizza and it was "100% raw". I saw the pizza and can confirm that it was raw. I don't know why, but we went back. This time we just flat out received the wrong order. Tonight I was walking home from work and thought "maybe they've had training. Maybe they'll be better". This time we were just flat out ignored. The clerk just kept sweeping while we stood there waiting for help. Guys, never go here. It's outrageously horrible.
3358;Do not come at 10:30 pm. I went on a Friday night and they close at 11.The store will already be packed up and the person there will scold you for not coming earlier. When I got to the Subway it was 10:35... 2 other people were in front of me. The attendant had already packed everything away before we had gotten there because he was pulling it all out to serve the people in front of me. When he got to me, he told me I should have come earlier if I wanted 3 subs.I told him I thought he closed at 11 and I was there at 10:35. He then replied that he packs up early... if he didn't want to serve any one else he should have turned off his sign. Very rude service.
3359;Went into this Subway today with my children.  Everything was fine until the attendant behind the counter gave attitude. He was not interested in serving us at all. Will never go back..
3360;I would say this is one of the worse locations I have visited. It was super quiet with no customers in line and only 2-3 sitting at the tables. The cashiers don't smile or greet you, and when I placed m order, which was a earl grey tea, double sugar n cream in a medium size, they looked super confused. She didn't understand how tea can be ordered double double. She stood there looking at me for a good 10secs, then walked away.No one really takes a sip of their drink before leaving the restaurant because we believe and trust that the employees have made us what we ordered and paid for. Also, because it's too hot to taste and we have places to go. After leaving, I took a sip of my tea, after it has cooled down a bit and it was TOTALLY not what I have ordered, there was no sugar in there at all! I wasn't going to put in the effort to travel all the way back to get them to switch my coffee.Maybe there's a reason why other Tim Hortons locations are full and not this one.
3361;Follow up visit today.  Ordered a very simple thing: small coffee, 2 cream.  Because I like waiting for it to cool a bit, I didn't check if the order was right until a while after leaving.  It's only a coffee - they couldn't have screwed that up, right?  Wrong.  Got a small black with 2 sugar.  Gross.  Come on guys, if you can't get a simple coffee right, how am I ever going to trust you with something more complicated, like a timbit, or heaven forbid - a sandwich with a customization like no tomatoes?  Yeah - strike one Timmies on this location.  I'll probably be back, but wasn't impressed today..
3362;If I wasn't addicted to caffeine and it wasn't the only Timmies drive through on my way to work I would pass it everyday. Worst service ever. Slow slow slow. And they always miss items you order so double check your order. Hope that corporate sees this and makes the owner smarten up. Looks so bad on Tim Hortons.
3363;I don't know what I can say other than that the service has declined to the point where I simply don't come here anymore. Slow to come to the counter, slow to fill the order, and frequent mistakes. Food quality wasn't as good either.It's a shame, as I liked coming in for lunch once in a while, but it's simply not worth the aggravation anymore.
3364;I was so excited when this place opened in my first semester of grad school.  And then I tried it.  And it was bad.  Bad.Toronto is a void for good mexican food, so it's not like the place had strong competition (this was also the pre-Chipotle days, and while I would never eat Chipotle in California, it's the best Toronto has).  Still, it was perhaps the worst Mexican food I had in the city.  The rice was cooked with canned veggies, the salsa might as well have come out of a can (it probably did), and none of the flavors in a simple veggie burrito meshed well.  On top of that, it was pricey for what you got.For a place called Burrito Fresh, it's really not that fresh.  Or good.
3365;It's funny how you can have a national chain, yet have no consistency from location to location. This Boston Pizza location is the worst of the worst! Food was cold, pasta was disgusting, and the pizza we ordered had something sitting on the bottom of the plate. Couple that with poor service and high prices and you have one terrible restaurant. Unfortunately, BP can continue to live in this town because there isn't much choice. Save some money and order takeout somewhere else
3366;45 minutes to get a drink ... And we made prior reservations. More than 2 hours to get our meals. Avoid this location like the plague!
3367;Poor food quality.  I doubt any actual cooking takes place in the kitchen - the kitchen staff reheats from frozen or deep fries and serves.  As previous reviewer has mentioned - your money is much better spent elsewhere.
3368;Terrible. Went for breakfast. Eggs and bacon burnt horridly. Inedible. Advised when paying bill it was awful and inedible. They tried to charge me full price for that meal and when I complained further they offered to take half that meal off bill claiming that I ate half of that garbage. I barely touched it.Was excessively rude and confrontational. Said I should have sent it back to be re-cooked. Um... the waitress never even came around to see if everything was ok. Accused me of just coming in to get free meal and told to leave and never come back. No problem there. Terrible food  and even worse customer service. Perfect place to go if you want bad food and to be verbally berated by staff.
3369;Sad I can't give it zero stars. Every time I drive by the place is empty and now I know why.  The fish was the tail end and filleted even thinner,  think sushi fish and chips. The batter was rock hard to the point the knife couldn't cut it so I had to pick it up like a pizza slice. Everything was hmmm? On par with the fish. I left it and paid $15 for nothing.  Tantamount to theft
3370;Accidentally went to this place! Said that we would get a big discount for the pizza slices if we order pre-made slices! And we got a DISCOUNT of $1!! .  I would have gone with that, but it's the attitude of the  cashier/server that threw me off!. He dealt with us as if he was paying us to eat his burnt/dry pizza!!! Never going back to this place and dear friends please stay away!!
3371;I ordered x large deluxe pizza with EXTRA GARLIC, EXTRA GINGER, EXTRA HOT CHILLIES AND EXTRA SAUCE.  I received pepperoni pizza with NO EXTRAS AT ALL !!!!!!!!!I called the place and the man had audacity to tell me that he did put those extras in my pizza and I could drive back with what I received to show it to him !!! Outrageous !!!
3372;Worst place ever Worst experience Being their regular customer, got very disappointed tdy with their service The person who took my order sounds really rude on the phn and when u called back after 45 minutes they said we have no order under your name and number. That sounds really bull shit. U freaking guys are not only one making pizzas in Ontario Really bulshit service Don't even know how to talk with customer and how to take order on the phones. U guys don't even deserve one star
3373;About wings: small, dry, tasteless, taste like they've been frozen for monthsAbout my experience:Called to complain about the wings, said I wanted a credit for next time or something else.Not possible. Agent says I'm either getting replacement wings or nothing.I get replacement wings. Same horrible quality. Driver comes to pick up the previous wings, opens the box in front of me, counts them. Of course they're all there. Never seen such bad manners in my life.Called back, said I still hate the wings, you can have them back. Agent says that was all they can do. No credit. No refund. Attitude of "now they're your wings, your problem"Threw out the wings. Attached is a pic of them in the garbage, where they belong.
3374;I will preface this by saying that this store used to be good.  Unfortunately it appears that something has drastically changed with them.  We attempted to order online for delivery at 8 pm on a Thursday night.  We got an error saying the store was closed (even though the hours showed it open until 11pm).  We called customer service and were told that the store itself was open but was not delivering due to inclement weather.  We accepted it as there was a snow storm going on and wound up not ordering.  The next night (tonight - Friday) we thought we would try again, this time we got the same error (It said delivery should be open until 12 and we were ordering at 11:15).  So we called customer service again, and were told that the store was open and delivering but they just forgot to change some setting on their side so we could order through them.  We needed a couple of minutes to get our order together so they said to call back.  We did and got a hold of Nitish who said that Double Double had changed the del
3375;I wouldn't be surprised if this place started charging customers for every mushroom piece they put on a pizza. Horrible service. Horrible food. I'm ashamed to say I've had food from here.Believe me when I say a 1 star rating is very generous of me.
3376;this place doesnt deserve a star , i found a cockroach baked on my pizza , reported to toronto health.
3377;Though I have not tried their Pizza or Wings, this review is only based on their Shawarma Wraps:I was running short on time as I was heading to work... I saw a sign which offered a 2 shawarma wraps for $7.99. As I went inside, one of the first things I noticed was that the store was empty (no customers)... and veggies seemed stale, and meat seemed dry...though I crossed my fingers hoping it would turn out okay... The gentlemen who was making my shawarma had zero (no/nadaaaa/not even a bit) of a clue on how to fill in or wrap the shawarma... the thing was coming apart as he was making it...Another gentlemen behind him was cleaning the counters with a piece of cloth and instantly came this way, opened up the fridge beneath the veggies and opened up an old container... stuck his bare hands in and grabbed a bunch of lettuce and threw it onto the salad table... disgusted. Shawarma wraps are advertised as 2 for $7.99... but was charged about $10, I asked why and to my surprise he said 'chicken only special'
3378;What a dirty filthy place. I will never go there again. Only 3 of the fountain pop worked, my feet stuck to the floor, all tables were dirty, all garbage was over flowing and garbage on the floor in front of garbage cans. Poor service. My hands were stinky from just touching items in that cesspool. No way never again.
3379;Wow, this was my go to Harvey's but the quality has gone downhill. Cara should check the quality of there restaurants when they give someone a franchise. Horrible food which includes salty fries and a poor excuse for a milkshake. I guess if I paid another $1.99 I might have gotten the other half of the shake. I only gave it 1 star and that is for the wonderful cashier that works there.
3380;I made an order online and they managed to still messed up my order. Looking at the fact that its all written right in front of them. Worst part is they wouldn't admit it that they made a error and was just being a total jerk. Worst customer service experience ever.
3381;There was only one person working here. The wait time was ridiculous because of that. They either need to hire more people or put more staff on... don't treat your staff like slaves.
3382;If I could I would give this place 0 out of 5 for never having enough servers. They told us to wait for 30 min for a table even though they had empty tables. The reason was because they did not have enough servers and this is the second time this has happened. Never going there again until they hire more staff.
3383;I promise that in my honest opinion this pizza hut is a horrible joke. Once, employess walked by my for 15 minutes before i approached someone and asked for service. Another time they said they cant serve me because they rant out of dough, on a subsequent visit they couldnt take customers because they ran out of cheese. My order here has gotta made incorrectly here a few times. I ordered pizza from here once and it took 3 hours to come. One day while at the pizza hut on sandalwood and kennedy area, the pizza hut lost electrical power and we couldnt see in the dark during eat so had to evacuate. Pizza huts in America are amazing! In Brampton Ontario Canada they are nightmares! I swear i think that everytime God has protected me from getting fat.
3384;Terrible service twice now, 2 Saturdays in a row we walked out of this restaurant having not been seated for over 10 minutes, then when getting seated not being approached for over 15 minutes no water or any attention from the wait staff
3385;Ordered 2 pizzas for delivery both were cold ordered Saturday night . Called the store and a supervisor lady was very rude didn't know how to talk to customers ,would never recommend this branch to anybody
3386;Horrible. Waited 15 minutes cuz the staff was too lazy to clean tables. There were plenty if empty tables but they were all dirty and had dishes stacked on them.Waitress messed up BOTH of r simple pizza orders. When the correct ones finally arrived they were awful. All crust and very little toppings. We watched a server drop a take out container on the floor then proceed to fill it with someone's leftovers. Same server then filled another container on top of a pile of dirty plates. Will never return to another Pizza Hut again.
3387;Horrible.  Perhaps Canadian Pizza Huts are different?Took over an hour to deliver pizza to my hotel room located 200 yards away.  When it arrived it was cold.Went in a few days later to order carryout and it took forever.  A couple came in to order a pizza, nobody came out to help them, they waited about ten minutes then left.
3388;Terrible service! Walked in, stood at the take out desk for exactly 7 minutes, before I had to make a call (pretending to be a take out customer) so someone could come to the desk to serve me. The staff let my food wait on the desk for about 5 minutes before letting me know, and once they alerted me, they greeted me with "hey buddy, don't you want you p'zone." Yes I do, now if I'm there for take out, why not bring it out to me.Avoid this place at all costs.
3389;We walked in on a Thursday night at 9 PM, an hour from closing. There were no customers inside and 3 employees - one was sitting at a table and 2 behind the counter cleaning up. We stood at the counter waiting to be acknowledged to no avail. The one employee at the counter got up and went to the back and the other two continued to do what they were doing completely ignoring us. It's one thing if they were busy serving other customers but seriously, to not even acknowledge us? We walked right out. There are numerous other burger chains in the area where our money was better spent.
3390;Burger was dry and over priced. Clear that employees or management really don't care about their food quality.
3391;SMALL!CRAMPED!HARD TO NAVIGATE!Just went here for lunch - will never go back again.  The staff were rude, it was not "buys" in there at all.  They messed up my order by putting on the wrong sauce and then got mad when I asked for it to be fixed....it wasn't a big fix - just pull off the suff that I didn't want.....The bread was not fresh - even though it looked like it came out of a fresh tray.  I didn't have it toasted, but it sure tasted like I did.I'd skip this location.....
3392;Subway restaurants are always smaller then say McDonald's or the rest of their competition for that matter because... actually ,I have no know why. Do they think their customers are so healthy conscious they will only drop by to pick a quick sub mid-marathon and thus making tables and chairs in the locales superfluous?This place is however 'tiny' even by Subway restaurant standards. Whenever I went into most Subway sandwich locations I feel as if I am channeling Jonah as I tried to find my way through the nooks and spaces you would think you will find stomach-deep inside a whale.You go into this place and you feel as if you have been swallowed by a perch. The staff seems to realize this and are generally equally unhappy or pretty silent. Also I do not think they have the foot traffic outside perhaps lunch hours to keep their bread fresh enough.As such, in my experience their sandwiches come out more as carb and protein filler than an actual sandwich made by a Sandwich Artist (An artist? Really? Wtf?
3393;Food was okay but it too way too long.   Also passed me off that they force you to pay 15% tip on terrible service.   Tip is also calculated after taxes so end up paying 20%
3394;I recently went with locks to order a fettucine Alfredo with my aunt her food was OK but they messed my order up it said that the fettucine Alfredo contain no onions but when it got to me I found onions in it and that was horrible now I personally hate onions so I sent it back when the manager came and her that I was sending it back he yells at the cook saying that he was supposed to put no onions in it so they bring me another one and it still has onions so we end up leaving and going to Popeyes I don't know if I've ever had a worse experience thanks Whitlock's
3395;A caricature of the typical Beach restaurant, cementing the neighbourhood's reputation for incredibly bland, boring, blasé food.  Came here by accident, really, drawn in by the nice patio. And, umm, that's the only good thing I can say about it. Burgers were overcooked and boring, served on an undesirable and somewhat stale bun. Veggie burgers were a bit less boring, but still boring and still not good. Crab cakes were a far more noteworthy but only because they were a frickin' train wreck of flavourless pulp!  Yeesh - I may have nightmares about them!Prices were very low for a restaurant with such a nice setting and patio, but still not worth the price.
3396;Came here for dinner on a Sunday night. The staff did not acknowledge us for a good 10 minutes while we were waiting at the door. On top of that, once we were seated, our server didn't bother taking our orders or giving us cutlery until we had asked 3 times. The food was great but because of the craptastic service I would never come here again.
3397;One Star is too generous!! What a waste of space! We returned here after 5 years and wish we had not! My husband got sick after two bites of the burger and my child's nuggets were in fact chicken sausage!!! My advice is STAY AWAY!!! If you go, expect these:1) Dirty restaurant, filthy tables and cutleries 2) Terrible and unsanitary food3) warm beer 4) grumpy and rude serversClose it down and make room for someone to open a decent place please!
3398;Came in to this spot to have lunch before heading out to the beach, the waitress sat us down on the patio at a dirty table, it had something spilled all over it... so I gave her the benifit of a doubt thought she would come back and wipe it down, well she comes back about 10min later with menus and puts them down right on the nasty wet table, and just walks away. That was all I needed, didn't even bother eating here so can't say anything about their  food, but I'm sure when the staff can sit customers at a funky table the rest of the place is just as dirty... we wound up going next door  and had great meal.Skip this place and go elsewhere
3399;A definite new low.We booked a babysitter and descended on what used to be a one of our places to hit nearby for brunch. When we got there I was surprised by 2 things: it was the "grand new opening" of new owners and the place was just about empty.We soon found out why.The potatoe salad had grown a skin and when scooped up, revealed a paler white colour (I decided against it).  The bread was all precut and hard as a rock.  The butter was placed on the fireplace (and liquid).  The one lonely egg benny left had a yellow goo on it, dried and separated (and never refilled), the sausage cold, overdone and rubbery.  There were mussels, that looked like raisins.  The tomato sauce was so cooled down and it looked like a sticky jam.  The potatoes (although cold) were tasty.Brings me to the staff...  When I overheard patrons (regulars, knowing the prior owner by name) inquire about the new owners, they replied "some guys" had bought it.  They were short, unmotivated and incredibly rude. I was clearly not eating
3400;Went to Whitlock's for a late brunch on a Saturday morning. Our table of 4 was seated right away. There were 3 other tables with customers, some of which were just finishing up their meals.Coffee/teas and waters were brought over quickly. We ordered 2 classic breakfasts, one breakfast burrito, and one breakfast skillet.  It took so long for us to get our meals, that we were wondering if they were harvesting the wheat for our toast?!When the food arrived, my toast and eggs were cold, alongside my soggy bacon. How disappointing. We finished what we could however, getting our bill took a long time as well.It seemed confusing to me....only 4 other tables inside the restaurant however, time management from the server was really lacking.Although the complimentary banana bread was tasty and a nice touch, I'm not sure I would return to Whitlock's. How could good service for a full restaurant or delicious food during a buffet actually exist here?
3401;The service here was atrocious . The "gentleman" serving us was rude, dismissive and intimidating. Food took over an hour, then came out wrong . Didn't dare send it back we never would have made it out of there by midnight. Food mediocre . Never going back
3402;It is 6:15 pm on a Sunday night .. I got here At 4:50 thinking I would beat the rush .. dining by myself .. the staff was quick to refill my water .. got 3 glasses .. enjoyed my Caesar salad  and mussels .. waited 15 minutes .. was handed my bill with no question as to whether I wanted coffee or dessert .. not happy with service .I could understand if they were busy .. but they were not & had 2 waitresses !  I complained when someone finally came .. I ordered desert and coffee .. the dessert was explained to be on the house ..
3403;Arrived around 6 pm Nov 26. One server. Salmon was gross - overcooked and smothered in cream and overdosed with Dill, dill dill. Caesar salad was also smothered in dressing. Seems all the items on the menu are cream sauces - everything fattening. Salad was limp and tasteless. Service spotty.Worst thing was - the white wine was definitely watered down. I asked for a different white wine and it was even more watered down - the waitress(owner?) was definitelty adding water to the $10 glass of white - she feigned shock when I mentioned it - will never go back - try the Green Eggplant nearby - great food, prices and warm service.
3404;I've been to Whitlocks many times over the years and generally the service and food were fantastic. I wanted my boyfriend to try it and it's so cozy in there with the fireplace so we gave it a shot. We arrived at 7:30 on a Wednesday night. There were 2 tables of two including us and a party at the back (around 8-10ppl). There was one server who was working her butt off and a manager (I am guessing) that was COMPLETELY USELESS. We watched him watch the waitress do all the work as we waited 25 minutes for our drinks. It was an hour+ before our order was taken for our entree. My questions are:1. where is the old wait staff who were awesome?2. why is there one server on a wednesday night?3. why are you a restaurant manager if you can't help in a restaurant?? 4. why did it take 2 people almost 3 hours to eat dinner?I will not be returning. I will also be telling my family and friends who visit not to return!I was embarrassed for making the recommendation. This place now SUCKS.
3405;Four meals ranged from mediocre to poor, by any standard. The prices and decor promise better. Service was acceptable, but we were the only customers for much of our visit. The mushroom ravioli: "pretty terrible" and "made my stomach hurt". The butter chicken: lots of fatty dark leg meat, soaking in a thin bed of oil. Chicken parmesan: "tasted fine, but a little crunchy around the edges" (as voted by somebody who never offers a negative comment). Hamburger: "disappointing fries were good". A very small glass of the house white wine sells for $6. $90 for four meals, two drinks, and no appetizers or desserts.Don't sit beside the patio windows on a cold night. A brisk breeze blows through. We should have switched to another table. At least I had a candle to warm my hand, and a thick cloth napkin to cover my leg.
3406;Terrible experience. I am a regular at green eggplant and wanted to try a new place. There was no line up however, I was asked to wait as they prepared our table for 20 minutes. The table is blocked with 2 other tables so everyone you get up or even move you have to say excuse me. The server was extremely rude. Forget about being greeted just for asking to options of bread, she laughed at me. The food is alright. I had burger. Nothing special. Would not recommend this place to anyone, let alone be back. To like this place you have to have a taste for rude behavior, slow service, and sarcasm. One of the worse places I have ever been.
3407;All I can say is big show, no results. I've been here for their brunch and happy hour snacks, which you would think they can't screw up. Well, let me tell you that it is actually kinda gross. The brunch buffet is awkward, messy and really nothing special other than gut fill. Happy hour apps were all deep fried from frozen and really greasy. As much as I want to like this place for its location and (potential for great) atmosphere, it misses the mark in a big way.
3408;We decided to make a return visit to Whitlock's after a relatively disappointing experience earlier this year. Sad to say, this visit has permanently moved this restaurant to the "do not visit ever again" category. What a complete disappointment, through and through.We were seated quickly enough, but it took some time for our waitress to check in and take our drink order. When she came, she couldn't remember the three drinks we ordered, and had to repeat them back to us. She got one of them wrong. This was just the beginning of the poor service.She came back quite some time later to take our food order, and again, repeating everything back to us, making mistakes, and us correcting her. I ordered a side house salad. She brought a side caesar instead, even after confirming back to me. I ordered the pad thai. What an awful dish. Over-sauced, over-sweet, and over-done chicken and shrimp. My wife had the salmon. It was over-broiled and under-flavoured. My daughter had chicken on a bun, which was also over-co
3409;Had lunch for 2 - spent $50 and it felt worth $10.  The fries are garbage and the food was mediocre at best.  Service was pleasant - so no problems there - but definitely did not get value for the money.  Would not recommend.
3410;One should NEVER mistake avocado for roast beef.After years of hearing about how amazing Whitlock's was, I took two friends from out-of-town here for a late lunch on Sunday afternoon. I ordered the club sandwich and was a little surprised to see a slice of roast beef tucked in amongst the chicken, bacon and tomato.Horrified, I realized it was greyish-brown avocado. There was no way in hell this was sliced any time in the previous 12 hours, but I was a little hungover and just couldnt be bothered to send it back. I should have, as the sandwich got worse from there: the ciabatta bun was doughy, the chicken cold, the bacon HARD and cold. The only redeeming feature of this meal was the chipotle mayonaise which was actually quite delicious.I really shouldnt have paid a cent for it, but again, I just didnt want the hassle. I wont be back.
3411;I had a pretty bad experience. The food was decent.. But the service was bad and the staff were not helpful towards the situation that occurred during the night. Which made the overall experience very unpleasant. I was with a few friends and we were rushed off the patio at 11 pm because the patio was being shut down. So we moved inside. When we moved, I realized that I had left my new iphone4 outside, when I went to look for it.. it was gone. When I called it about 5 minutes later.. it was already off! We were the last ones on the patio so there was no way a customer could have taken it. ..Still no sign from the restaurant about my phone. It's unfortunate.
3412;I brought my family who was visiting from out of town for a birthday dinner here. The appetizer had a hair in it, which apparently was not a big deal to the server. We asked to speak to the manager, who was the owner, and he would not come to our table to speak to us. Unacceptable. We finished our drinks and left for another sub-par restaurant in the Beach. Of what we did have was mediocre at best. This was a very disappointing experience and I will not recommend or go back. The dining situation in the Beach is dreadful. I don't understand how such an affluent neighbourhood can tolerate such boring, uninspired, and just plain bad food service. I'm embarrassed to live in the area now.
3413;whitlock's restaurant, they should be ashamed for holding title of this name. I just got back from dinner and can not believe what I just ate. Any food that involved preparation was NOT done as it should of been it was absolutely disgusting and I do NOT RECOMMEND eating here.
3414;The other reviews here seem to say that this place is okay for brunch, but terrible for main meals. We went here for supper on a Friday evening and guess what? Yup, it was poor.The crab cakes were all right, but nothing special. The panko-crusted chicken was fine, but a tad overwhelmed by the sun-dried tomatoes. The bruschetta was, as noted here by another reviewer, oddly served with tomato on the side of the garlic bread, instead of atop.But most annoying to me was the disappointment x 3 in the jambalya. First off, within a few bites, I bit into a small black stone. It was probably in the rice (I hope), but I set it on the side of the plate and didn't want to make a big deal of it. Then I bit into a bone in my supposedly boneless chicken. Again, I set it aside, and didn't say anything--it happens. But what was most disturbing was the taste of the sausages in this dish. It had the off taste of meat that has gone past its expiry date. I tried a second piece, thinking that maybe the first was a fluke. Nope.
3415;Terrible service, if you want to see the team o servers fighting between each other this is the perfect place! I should have left the place as soon as the server was rude to answer my question! Don't go to this place! I'll never go back and don't recommend at all!
3416;Whitlocks certainly has a following, and I think it probably does provide a good Sunday brunch.However, my experience with my daughter and her family, looking for an early dinner on a Thursday, was a bit of a disaster.My grandson had a birthday and this was just the family. When I got there they had ordered, and as it was a hot day, and it was early, I decided to wait and see what their food looked like.Everything was awful, sorry. Even the spring rolls were greasy. My daughter had ordered the blackened trout, which was dried out, served with with bok choy, wilted and lacking flavour. The portobello veggie burger, served on a cold white bun, with sad looking greens, fell apart when my grand-daughter attempted to eat it. Both children ate little but the fries.At around $20.00 for a main course, I think one could expect something a little better.Perhaps 5:30 is too early for the kitchen, and they are geared for a later crowd.Their problem, not our's.I agree with Will A. The Beaches have never had goo
3417;The only way this could have been more of a disappointment is if we left hungry. We booked well ahead for Christmas dinner and were looking forward to a festive treat. Upon arrival, the restaurant only had a few tables occupied, yet the one we had reserved was not available. We weren't seated promptly but left awkwardly at the door. We had to ask for our drinks, because the server didn't bring them to the table. The meal arrived cold, tasteless and very disappointingly, with no stuffing. We weren't offered additional beverages or coffee/tea with dessert. We overheard our waiter saying he wanted to get out of there. The time together for my daughter and I was more important than the meal, but there was almost no effort to make this a good experience so we didn't leave a tip. This restaurant has been a favourite for nearly 20 years, but I will not be going back.
3418;We stopped here for lunch on a Wednesday without knowing a thing about it - just liked the look of the place and the menu.  It turns out that one woman was in charge of making the drinks as well as running the food.  We waited 25 minutes for our drinks, and it went downhill from there.  Service was outrageously slow, and the food was barely mediocre.  French onion soup was half a bowl, caesar salad was fully of slimy and browning lettuce leaves, and the pulled pork on a bun was lukewarm.  We will NEVER eat here again.
3419;Terrible food! $19 for a plate of watery undercooked ravioli! After sending it back, it just doesnt look very appetizing at all! The only good thing to comment on was their bread, it came with two types of dip! Don't even bother with the salad, the tuna salad was basically a few spoonfuls of canned tuna & mixed greens! Not only are the food terrible, they charge highness prices! Doubt this place will last very long!Best to go elsewhere!
3420;Served by clumsy lady in yoga pants. Service was slow. Menus were dirty. One of our menus had 2 of the same page. We were not told about specials or offered the Prix Fixe menu advertised in the window.The bread was served in a plastic basket.Sangria consisted of Red Wine and a scoop of  random melon, and nothing else.The 12oz New York Striploin was actually a 6oz grilling steak reheated in a microwave, and necessarily overcooked. The "demi-glaze" was actually gravy from a package. The "Chef's Daily Vegetables" consisted of mostly stalks. Finally, the mashed potatoes were scooped like ice cream and microwaved on a plate.While they did replace the overcooked "New York Striploin" with a filet mignon, the mignon was then undercooked. The combination of poor service, dirty menus, and mislabeled and poorly cooked food results in a rating of 1 out 5. Would not Recommend.
3421;Understaff, 1 waitress for the whole restaurant on a Saturday noon. Foods came so late and they were all tasteless. The servant was nice and acknowledged the problem though.  Not going back.
3422;We moved to the Beach a couple of years ago and we'd often pass this restaurant while walking on Queen St. It has a great patio and always seems busy so we were excited to finally try it this past Mother's Day for brunch. What a total disappointment! First of all, they weren't making lattes or cappuccinos even though they had an espresso machine. Second, no chocolate milk for the kids. That's how brunch began and it went downhill from there.The omelette station was okay however they had the oddest non-brunch-like items at the buffet - like cooked peas and fish. And not smoked fish, like dinner style fish. It seemed like they just carted out the buffet from the night before. The eggs benedict were dry too. The dessert station had a couple of Sara Lee cakes and some jello. Pitiful. The only thing that was good was our server. The buffet didn't have bacon (who doesn't have bacon?) so she brought my son some from the kitchen.Will not be back.
3423;Stopped by for lunch and ordered the Bun Bo Hue since I figured it should be their specialty. The soup wasn't spicy enough and was bland, probably because they're trying to cater to Westerners. Also, the "large" size wasn't very big.There was a table of two young Chinese guys beside me and they both ordered the green tea bubble tea. Both took one sip of their drinks and didn't finish the rest. I'm assuming the drinks didn't taste very good.The thing that bothered me most was that the older lady (who I assume is/was the manager) was berating her workers in front of the customers. She was giving out orders on what to do and how to do it. It's fine if you have to instruct your workers but don't do it in the front dining area where all the guests can see. All of the wait staff at Hue Kitchen were visibly frazzled and stressed. They weren't communicating with each other and orders were missed or filled multiple times.All in all it was not a pleasant dining experience. Look for an another place if you're crav
3424;The flyer was left in my mailbox, so I decided to give it a try. Considering that there is a GOOD Pho place (Pho Asia 24) four doors down from Hue's, one would think that they would try a little bit harder to compete. Pho is supposed to come with sprouts and sauces - Hue's didn't.  The Pho was bland, and not very good at all. The vegetable rolls were ok... but were dripping in oil. I understand that they are supposed to be oily, but this was over the top. They also sell a confusing mix of Indian food, which if they want to be a Vietnamese restaurant, the Pho should be priority #1The exterior to the restaurant is beautiful, and it really cleans up this area of King St. W, but if you are looking for Pho, I would suggest eating elsewhere.
3425;The place is, indeed, dingy. The owner is somewhat kind but for a $9 lunch special, all I get is 80% rice with 2 piece of tiny chicken curry and a bit of lentils. The food is pre-cooked and left without any heat to keep it warm. He offered to heat it up but he was going to put the styrofoam container into the microwave! That releases toxic chemicals!! I immediately said 'no thank you' and left.The food tastes like re-heated frozen food. Bland, not much flavour. Will not be returning.
3426;First off the restaurant is a sort of convenience store selling cigarettes and candy etc.  Its has a dingy and drab atmosphere inside, not even a fresh smell of cooked food. The chicken kabab I had was dry and tasteless, the man preparing my kabab wrap was not wearing gloves and actually licked his fingers to taste the hot sauce I asked for as im guessing he did not even know what was inside those bottles, he then proceeded to place his licked hand under running water for maybe 2 seconds to "wash" it, didnt bother to use soap OR dry his hand and with that wet hand continued to roll my wrap. If the food was amazing I MIGHT have considered forgiving that but the whole experience was disgusting. This place is dirty, the food is dirty, and you will definitely not ever return unless you need a 5 hour energy drink or cigarettes.
3427;@TOFoodInspector #YELPTOI am unlikely to ever use my "Elite" status on Yelp, but I am hoping my review is the first one to pop up here. This review is really just a warning. DO NOT EAT HERE. Yelp wasn't bringing many results for "Biryani" near my place. This was one of them. It was a cold night. I had a few friends over. And the pizza concept was getting old. So I thought, why not order some biryani! We all excitedly agreed over this idea. Having lived in GTA, a biryani craving is legit mouth-watering when you know what to expect. The biryani arrived looking like nothing that we expect. It was soggy, bright yellow in color, with some bright green pieces of rice as well. In other words, unappetizing. Then, we started eating it. And the whole thing was stale. 4 boxes of it. STALE. I called the place to complain. Obviously, nobody cares when things have been paid and done for. But I had to complain because this was absolutely unacceptable. The guy over the phone informed that the biryani was cooked 11am 
3428;Ordered a pretzel pizza from here and asked for a lesser amount of salt then the pizza usually comes with... Low and behold my pizza had no salt on the pretzel crust at all, was slightly burnt and the actual topping didn't start until it was halfway through the slice....the customer service 1-800 number had an automated message stating they were closed, so I attempted to call the location and I spoke with the same kid that made the pizza... Ryan I think his name was... He didn't care to help me with the situation and he assumed we wouldn't drive that far out for a replacement pizza now.... He was very rude and inexperienced with making these pizzas. I will never come to this location again!
3429;Was here to see if they had the bacon wrapped deep dish pizza, looks like its only available in the US. I did not like the smell in the place, found it had an old sock smell rather than a sweet pizza odor. Looked over a few already made pizza's, they did not all look the same, settled on a deep deep dish meat pizza, not good at all compare to other choices in Vaughan, but I can see the kids liking this over the frozen supermarket stuff ....maybe?
3430;I went here on their opening night. It was 15 bucks all you can eat sushi/sashimi buffet. It even included a pop! The food however was horrible and I wanted to order 10 pops just so I can make up for my 15 bucks. Fried tofu, sushi, sashimi, everything!!! I'm not picky at all, but this restaurant has to change their chef or something before they run out of business. :S
3431;I was in this place twice. What can I say, the first time was very good. The sushi, tampura, everything I tried was very good. The service was average minus [I asked for glass of water and never received it]. The décor was not very inviting, black and red very heavy and depressing. The second time I went there it was a total disaster, it was late at night one hour before closing time and you could feel that the staff just waited to close the place. But the major problem occurred when I ordered 6 pieces of salmon sashimi from all you can eat menu and received around 16 pieces. I was surprised but did not say anything, I thought because this was the end of the day the chef wanted to make us feel good. Indeed I was surprised when after several minutes came the chef and apologized that he made a mistake and gave us too many pieces. He also asked if he can take part of them back. Astonished, I of course said yes, next was total DISASTER he came to my plate, stick both of his hands in to my plate and took most o
3432;I have been there a total of 5 times. The first three times were brilliant. Friendly, attentive staff and beautifully prepared food. I raved about it to everyone.    Then comes the fourth visit. I brought an entourage to show off my new find. Mistake. Food-wise it was average. Not everything arrived as it should, what did arrive was ok at best and the service was about the worst I have ever experienced.  I could go on and on about how terrible it was, but you get the idea.    I am a trooper. I really believed in this place and ventured to go there one more time. Surely the prior visit was just an off night. Not so much. It started with us having to wipe down the table ourselves...and it was all down hill. so sad. Back to Masa.
3433;I have been to this location twice in the past two weeks.The first time the too cool for school teenager serving us looked at me blankly when I asked if the cheese was real.The second time the server said "yes" when I asked if the cheese was real. LIES! There is a sticker on the sneeze shield that says "NATURAL CHEDDAR" with a tiny astrix leading to a line at the bottom that reads "this is a processed product". Subway you will feel the full wrath of my ire because I'm tired of misleading advertising.Subway you may have succeeded in marketing your wares to the masses with your friendly boy-next-door actor "Jared" but you don't fool me. I'm done with you and your preservative laden, faux 'healthy' fast food.
3434;Food- Tried the new panini. It made everyone's jaws and heads ache just from chewing the bread. Service - Not acceptable. I wanted coffee/tea, the employee said they don't sell it, even though it was listed on the menu. I then said ok, I'll get a fountain drink (thinking I wanted the smaller version one 16oz). I was charged and given a 21oz fountain drink. When I asked for the 16oz, the employee said I can't get it because it needs to be made as a special request. I asked if I can add some extra veggies on my Panini since the veggies was less than my usual encounters with subway, the employee said no because it will make my sandwich soggy. Overall experience - One bad egg really should the bunch sometimes. I've had better Subway experiences, but this younger gentlemen really ruined it.
3435;I should have checked out the reviews before ordering pizza from these guys.  It takes almost 50 minutes for the pizza to arrive from the time the order is placed, which I would not have had a problem with if the pizzas were warm. Once the pizza arrived they were cold and soggy. I called the location again to simply ask the breakdown of the total bill the guy who took the call, possibly the owner, gave me a lots of attitude and informed me that he invested $150,0000 into his system. This is when I stopped being nice and raised my voice telling him I did not care about his investments and that all bills must be itemized.  I told him having a single line item showing the total charge on the receipt is not helpful.  For a guy who is pretty gruff on the phone and quick to talk over his customers he went on to tell me to calm down and that's when I lost it it. The only 'nice' thing about this situation was the delivery guy since he was polite.  The person handling phone orders can learn his delivery guy.
3436;Pizza is greasy. Pizza slices are stale. Sometimes they serve you yesterday's left-overs. I like the thin crust though.When I went there today the worker collected my money and then without washing his hands he put his hand in the mozzerella cheese and sprinkled it on my manicotti.   My manicotti was still cold inside when served to me, so I had to give it back to him to put back in the oven again.  The manicotti was low quality.The garlic bread was stale and cold too.  So I gave it back to him.  He put it back in the oven after I had taken a bite out of it.  They grossed me out.  I will never go back there again.
3437;This place is not sanitary. One of the guys behind the counter making the pizza was coughing.  So he covered his  mouth with his hand and then went back to kneading  the dough.  Perhaps other cooties are included for free.
3438;Decided to try this place out and so I placed an order online. I was called to say they have no gluten-free dough for our pizza bases and would I like to change my order. Not off to a good start.
3439;Went after reading the reviews and the article on Globe and Mail. Highly disappointed, since I  went there on my birthday. Biryani is my favourite food and it's so integral part of our cuisine. First of all, what this restaurant serves is not Biryani at all. It's some sort of spicy rice. It's an insult to call these spicy rice Biryani.  I'm giving it one star since it's such a misrepresentation of Biryani. You can get 100x better Biryani with 2x quantity both rice and meat from any decent south Asian food joint. Save your money and disappointment
3440;I was looking forward to this place. Was extremely hungry. My friend and I drove 45 to get to this place to try their biriyani. When I walked in to the place, it did not please me. It was messy and looked filthy. Old carpets and dirt everywhere.  I went to order and was told the biriyani was sold out! It was 3pm. The women in the front told us that she had not expected customers that day but they did and the food ran out. I was told to come back at 5pm when it will be ready again. WTF! What kind of a restaurant are you guys running. They didn't have anything available except pop. My friend and I decided to go to Silvers poon and buy us food there.
3441;The worst biryani I have ever had! A few months ago after hearing some reviews from people I know stating that this is the best South Indian biryani, I drove to Scarborough from Etobicoke to try this place. I lived in South India so I know my South Indian food. This was the WORST biryani I have ever had. I have never made biryani but I am pretty sure that I can make better biryani. It was so bland. I will never go back.
3442;I decided to try out this place last week - HORRIBLE. - I ordered a Chicken Clubhouse sandwich & the Wife ordered pasta in tomato sauce. I never thought a Clubhouse could be made this bad, but they managed to do it - the chicken was dry as shoe leather, the bread stale & burnt & the cheese on it, was well beyond it's prime. My wife's pasta, was 7 steps beneath canned. We won't be going back - EVER. - We couldn't Get away fast enough, or far enough.
3443;I always hate eating here with my family. Service always takes forever. I think they do this because they want you to go back to the casino while you're waiting for the food. I usually have to wait a bit of time to be seated when there are servers that are on the floor that see me waiting. I don't know why they just don't seat me? Also sometimes servers can have a bit of attitude. I hate coming here but I only come because of the food vouchers.
3444;Is there anyone here to serve us? Hello! Anyone??? I'm thirsty and I'd love a cold beer! I think I'm actually being ignored on purpose.Maybe the worst service I've ever had. Wings were good, but they don't make up for the lack of service.I can walk here from home, and I was so hoping I was going to enjoy this place.
3445;Luckily my mother in-law answered and paid because I would have sent the entire order back. Tey told me 50 mins on the phone and literally 1 1/2 hours later it arrived just as I was makinh some oter food for my kid cause he was starving....then to top it off they gave us the wrong order. Last time I order from this restaurant. Oh and when I oredered I was put on hold for 5 mins until I had to hang up and re call them. Wtf???
3446;Pizza of crap!!! Called this restaurant while I was staying in the Marriott on business. Mind you I haven't ordered from Pizza Hut in years but decided due to a long business day, I would go ahead and order some pizza. Well when I called and placed the order through the reservation line, the lady told me it would be approximately 30 minutes. After 45 minutes I called the local restaurant the manager told me that the driver would be leaving shortly and said that the people in customer service did not know what they were talking about because his drivers were busy and they should have told me 45 minutes to hour. When the pizza arrived, not only did the Driver put the bag with the pizza in it on the ground while he had me sign the credit card document. Then of course to my surprise opening the box the pizza was completely cold. Mind you this pizza was not cheap... Full price thin pepperoni pizza for $25. When I called the manager and explain to him that this pizza was cold and he proceeded to tell me "the pi
3447;TURN BACK. RUN. SAVE YOUR MONEY. I have been a long time customer of pizza Hut so I know the standard for pizza Hut pizzas. The pizza that I recieved was absolutely unnaceptable. There was extremely little toppings, sauce, and there were holes in the pizza. I know I got the sale items, so a little deviation from the gold standard will be expected but the pizza I recieved was so lacking, that it bordered what can only be felt like a scam.I felt scammed out of my money.
3448;Wrong order then SICK!So we ordered from this Pizza Hut because it is the only one that would deliver to us. They show up with two pizzas. One of them was the wrong pizza and the other pepperoni pizza barely had any cheese on it.  Calling the store about the order, the guy pretends that he doesn't understand what I am talking about, until finally he understands when I practically scream, You. Brought. The. Wrong. PIZZA! Okay he says, and he says he will send out the right pizza, and another pepperoni pizza with the right amount of cheese, after making me look online to make sure I had placed the right order. He let us keep the wrong pizza, but we had to return the pepperoni so he could show the cooks. 30 minutes later. Yeah, I know, 30 minutes later, and the store is literally 5 minutes away, the pizza shows up.  The next day, my wife had diarrhea all day, I kept going to the washroom, my 5 year old son had a stomach ache and went to the washroom multiple times, and my 3 year old daughter,  who only at
3449;I would give this franchise a zero if possible. We ordered to watch the game with the family, and we were already making ourselves other food by the time this palce delivered. Delivery was late (it took us 45 minutes to get one order of pizza, 8bites. And cinnaparts), food was stone cold, and i had to call them once in between. I asked where my order was, they said "delivery guy is on the way", and hung up. My house is a five minute drive from their store, and the guy shows up 15 minutes later. Not one single "sorry about the wait", from the manager nor the delivery guy. Ridiculous customer service, i have no idea why they are still open. NEVER order here.
3450;This place has officially the worse pizza ever! On top of that they have bad service as they would not bring me a new pizza even though it was WAY undercooked and suggested that I could speak to the manager until Monday. Please don't bother going to this location
3451;Terrible pizza. Im not sure how Pizza Hut came to be known as a "great pizza place", but this place is terrible. Over priced, no flavor, and small.I honestly think a frozen pizza would have had the same quality, if not better than a Pizza Hut pizzaNever again.
3452;Service here was just terrible. I ordered 3 whoppers. 1 as a combo and the cashier made a mistake of punching in as 3 combos. He then rolled his eyes and talked to his manager. Not once have I felt so offended just to order at bk. He then felt the need to lecture me about the proper way of ordering my food. Don't get mad at the customers just because you punched the bill wrong.
3453;OBLIVIOUS service. Absolutely terrible. since my family is a little on the larger side, we tend to Want to sit in the booths. we asked the black lady if we could sit at the booths but she said " no sit here" in a loud disgusting tone.Firstly, the whole restaurant is practically empty and I think we have the right to sit where we want. Fuck this bitch.My fam got so pissed we left the restaurant and went to symposium.  I'm checking out.
3454;I don't know why I bother to keep giving this location a chance?  I'm on maternity leave with a new baby which means TIME is valuable, from everywhere I go, everything I eat drink, every restaurant I go is now limited. We chose to come here because it's more baby friendly and quiet during the weekdays. We were greeted and seated very promptly but everything went downhill after.  Our server took 10 minutes to just come to our table and take our orders.  It gets worse and worse: our food arrived surprisingly at a decent time opposed to other reviews I've read.  We ordered nachos and the chips were stale and chewy, my mom ordered the Spanish paella and the chicken was rubber and dry, sausage tasted rotten, I ordered the lobster grilled cheese sandwich where the portion of the lobster was mainly only on the center of the sandwich and worst was it tasted so fishy and unfresh. I ate half of it and didn't bother with the other half. The absolute worst was when we asked for the bill we waited 15 minutes before we
3455;That whole place needs to get a new manager and all-new staff. Everyone from the hosts to the waitress seemed to be completely overwhelmed and unable to handle more than 1 thing at a time. Took forever to get seated, water took 10 minutes, my coffee took 15 minutes and was cold (and gross). My eggs were overcooked and my toast was cold. The whole thing was a disappointment.
3456;I have been there regretfully twice and everyone that lives in Markham knows this is the place you would stay away from if you want good food and good value. Food is bad. Mine friend's salmon turns out to be overcooked and the fish and chips she got tasted stale. The side salad that I got was very very wet turning it into a soggy mess... Thankfully, we didn't spend too much money cause the food we got was on promotion but I really don't how the restaurant would charge so much on such bad food. The servers and decoration was however really nice and the location is very convenient after a day of shopping but I prefer to go to the mall's food court then eating here again.
3457;I normally don't give 1 star. But this place service is TERRIBLE. Sat down for 15 min before someone even acknowledge us. We actually had to flag them down for someone to give us water. The food is meh. I would never come back here again. And I would not recommend anyone to come here. You don't get service and the food is really not that great. Save your money and go somewhere else. We end up leaving because we never saw our server.
3458;The service was okay. The fries were yikes. We had a un uniform waiter who tried to service us. The chicken was dry. Plus, we went in on a non busy day and service was still problematic. The water, they left out our lemon wedges. The lemonade juice was terrible, tasted like powder, too sugary.
3459;Disappointing.  Been here several times and the service is seriously lacking. We were seated and given menus.  Then it seemed like we were forgotten for a good 20 minutes.  We proceeded to enter our orders in.  Once again forgotten. The food took forever to come. To give u an idea. The raptors game didn't start yet when we ordered. And when the food came out it was beginning of third quarter.  Chicken in the salad was dry.  Fries were cold and rather greasy since it's put in a steel cup with no holes.   By the way the prices have gone up rather steeply since I came here last. About 2-3 dollars for everything.  Which is fine. But I expected more with the increase.    The worse part was a sense of attitude from the waitress after we paid.  The waitress told my grandma to pass her plate over to her to take away.  She then proceeds to order us to pass her the plates.  That's unacceptable. My grandma can barely lift the plate.   If they can't grab everything they should wait till we leave or reach over. I have
3460;I really don't suggest anyone to give pickle barrel markville a chance. After shopping, my friend and I decided to go despite terrible reviews.  I can honestly say, I've never written ill of a restuarant but this is totally ridiculous.  We walked in and was seated promptly. The server came and ask if we wanted to start off with a drink. We said we need a couple of minutes to decide. The waitress came back in about 15 minute. She finally took our orders, I ordered a beet salad and I had one adjustment to the salad I wanted to order. I asked if I could have it with salmon rather than chicken.  She said she would have to ask the manager first, that was another 15 mins. We came back and said the adjustment was possible but onky $3 extra. Surely, she would come out with a salad looking like this.... Lettuce were huge and not cut and there were still skin on the beets. To whom this may concern, if you fail at making salad, you may need to consider other profession.
3461;Saturday morning was my first time at the pickle barrel in years. I remember coming here and loving the atmosphere. I wish my experience was better. The food was average. The service is what made the experience truly awful. The waitress Katherine gave attitude when my guest asked questions about the food. She took forever to take orders and rarely checked on us. The restaurant was empty and we should have been seen to or taken care of. We had to ask her for water refills. When we were presented the bill, we needed it split in half even though we tried to get her attention, she walked by our table multiple times, not caring. Finally my friend went to her station to ask for separate cheques. She put her finger to my friend's face and said "I'm busy hold on." She then made my friend wait 5 minutes before leaving her behind and heading straight to our table with separate bills. In my opinion tips should be worked for, not expected. I refused to give her a tip. This waitress was the WORST waitress and complete
3462;Absolute garbage experience tonight. Two of the entrees were overcooked, have you ever had Spanish piellea with absolutely no sauce and clumpy rice?They gave out horrid tables and said all the booths were reserved. The whole time we were there from start to finish the booths were empty. The front staff seemed to want to drive business away since they all seem over worked. Surprising since the amount of work being done seems non existent. No one came by mid meal to check up on refills/drinks. When we complained about the way overly dry entrees the server asked the mgr to remove them from the bill. But there was no formal apology or remorse for the huge screw up. All night long we saw other tables sending stuff back. Seems like the line cooks were rebelling or too untrained to turn out a good meal.
3463;This location is just bad, the food is terrible and service is average at best. Was promptly seated at a table and it all went downhill afterwards. Order the burger and fries, hard to screw that up right? Fries was stale and the burger was oily as hell.
3464;Use to come here all the time. My last visit will be just that.. My last visit. This place has unfortunately gone down hill. By that I literally mean it's gone down hill, through a fence, into a cess pool of disgusting water and drowned. It's really sad to see a place that use to be so great become what this place now is. I feel like the only way this place can be what it once was would be new management? Maybe change up kitchen staff? Who knows. Sad sad sad. Won't be returning. Wouldn't suggest it to anyone.
3465;Do not go here.I used to love going here but recently the service and food quality has gone down the drain. The last time I came here with my girlfriend, she got a plate of soggy wet calamari. Absolutely awful and gross, it looked like it was left out overnight to dry and tasted morbid. After she told the waiter, he just shrugged his shoulders. He was also socially awkward af. (How did he even get the job as a waiter? Wtf?) This time, the hostess looked like she hated her life. When she seated us, we asked if we could move to somewhere else and she grabbed the menus and moved us (she seemed to have a bad attitude). After we were seated, it took me more than 5 minutes to get someone to notice my hand was raised. I had to get their attention by saying 'excuse me' really loud. There was no apology for the wait, just 'what can i get you'.This place does not even make you feel welcomed and the food quality is definitely not worth the price.I even made an account just to post this. Thats how bad it is.
3466;Horrible service. Waited for so long for the server to come to our table to introduce herself and offer drinks/appetizer. Then took another 15-20mins to send us our drinks. Then another 30mins to order and got our meals. My husband's meal was cold so he requested for his meal to be reheated, took so long to come back to him only to find out that our server forgot about it. The manager came to our table and asked my husband if he still "wants his meal?" Or does he want to order another meal? Any good manager will just give the client a meal right away without even asking as a courtesy. My husband was so upset and left the restaurant with no meal because he has lost his appetite. Our server ended up packing his meal to go as a complimentary meal. This whole situation I found is very unacceptable. Never will come back here.
3467;Super disappointing. I actually used to enjoy coming to this Pickle Barrel location however the food has gone from bad to terrible over my last few visits (I come back because I live nearby but this may be my last time) Calamari 1.5/5 : Soggy and small portion. Wasn't crispy at all and was poorly plated.PB Nachos 1/5 : Covered in raw lettuce which I found weird, cheese was uneven and the guacamole which we had to pay extra for was actually gross. I expected something freshly made to be honest.Sweet potatoes fries 3/5 : Only thing I found acceptable Service was acceptable but the crappy food means I won't be coming back.
3468;Working in the mall where this Pickle Barrel is located, this was often my go-to lunch destination. Not just for myself, but most of my coworkers as well. That has now changed for good! 3 of my Co workers went there to grab brunch a couple weeks back and brought it back to our store to eat. They ordered the waffles and fruit. When they opened the container they noticed little baby MAGGOTS crawling out of the fruit on top of their waffles!! We have never been so disgusted. I'm no expert, but maggots usually means rotting food. I don't know how often they clean their fridges, but after that experience, I'm guessing it's not often enough.Please, for your own health and safety....do not eat at this location. I know I never will again.
3469;Bad service. I Sat down with a table of 5 and no server came to see us until I specifically asked for drinks.  Once the drinks arrived, the server finally asked if we are ready to order. We ordered a salad (requested dressing on the side), kabob,  Spanish pella, and butter chicken.  When the food came,  the salad dressjng was on the salad, and the server asked if that was ok although it's a mistake. We were straving and took it anyway.. but there was no compensation given. The rice on the butter chicken was horrible! Packed and thick. The sausage on the pella was over fried, and the rice on the chicken kabob was rock hard. I addressed these issues to the store manager and she told me she will reflect them to the kitchen. She did not provide any follow up after that. The server came and told us there's a small discount given to us due to the quality of the food..  she gave us a whooping 5$ off from an 80$ bill. Not to mention that our drinks were not refilled and the bill took forever to come. I will not go ba
3470;The 1 star is for the state of the restaurant and the food quality, NOT for the waitress, Gayethiry who was extremely friendly and really deserves 5 stars.We should have turned around and walked out the moment we saw just how bad the carpet was, crumbs, chunks of food, pieces of paper napkins, just a FILTHY floor.We went with the ribs and wings combo which was being advertised and looked good in the picture.  Unfortunately we were so disappointed - dry and HARD, like, hit someone over the head with them and knock them out HARD. Nowhere near fall off the bone.Thanks to Gayethiry for brining us extra sauces which we used to try to moisten the ribs and wings but that didn't work either.Markville has really become an upscale mall and this restaurant is only bringing it down.
3471;Worst service ever! We came for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Had to wait 15 mins for a table even though the restaurant was half empty. When we finally got seated, waited another 15 mins for someone to approach our table. The guy told us that our actual server, Mike, was busy and he'd be helping out. Fine. We placed our orders and got our appetizer in a relatively decent amount of time. We waited another HALF AN HOUR for our entrees. When they finally arrived, I asked for the bill and a couple of take out boxes since we had had enough and just wanted to leave. I had to ask three times for a take out box after that because they kept forgetting or just not caring. When I was finally brought one, it was too small and I had to ask again. Overall, the impression was that the staff just didn't care that we weren't being served or getting our food. Manager on duty was ridiculous and kept giggling through her apology at the table next to us who had suffered like we had ("I am never coming here again!" Is what I heard
3472;Bad service and food.  My friend was served and I sat there and was not served until past he was finished eating.  The excuse was a mix up with the computer.  After complaining the manager came over and offered a free dessert.  I asked the waitress what type of cheesecake they offer. She named a few including red velvet. When she brought it, it was red velvet cake not red velvet cheesecake. Maybe they should train their staff to know what is cheesecake.  It was also the worst red velvet cake I've ever had with the icing being a gel consistency rather than creamy and no flavour to the cake.  As well the fish I had ordered was completely bland.  Would not go back to this location.
3473;Terrible service. Inattentive waitstaff, slow kitchen. Prices are reasonable.  Food is edible.
3474;I've been here for an hour and a half and the food has not arrived. Service sucks! The portions are on the small side and the food Is just ok. I will never come back here.
3475;Worst place ever in the world. No server at all. nobody care the customer. won't go anymore.
3476;Came in and sat at the bar to watch a little of the Olympics on a Sunday afternoon at 3pm so not a very busy period...service from the bartender was a little slow...no acknowledgement...ordered a drink and no mention of menu if I wanted one...I grabbed one myself over the counter...he noticed I wanted a menu and he asked if I wanted to eat, I said maybe depending on what's on the menu...I finished my drink and he never asked if I wanted to order some food so I just asked for the bill...total damage = $7 for the beer...no tip req'd so not bad a deal (sarcasm)...I saved on tips...life goes on and I'm not coming back that's for sure...didn't even get a chance to enjoy the Olympics...I thought standard service was always usual but I guess not.
3477;Slimy restaurant! This location does not deserve the Pickle Barrel name!!! Waiter was overly friendly until there was a problem- then totally could have cared less! Food was overcooked and dry! Waiter substituted an item - then when asked if it contained nuts - said no...turns out it had macadamia nuts in it - had someone allergic to nuts at table - no customer care at all!!!!
3478;If I could have given my visit today a zero rating I would.  We went here for lunch and it wasn't particularly busy and we had dined before so wasn't too worried.  Upon wishing to be seated it took a while and I should have sent that as a sign of things to come.  Our waitress took our drink orders and appetizer request.  About a half hour into waiting we asked if it would be out soon, she gave us a grunt like "ya ya shut up it's coming".  When we finally got our appetizer after 45 minutes my friend commented that it better be very good for how long it took.  No apologies were offered.  The nachos were thrown onto the plate with some cheese and shredded up lettuce what a disappointment that was.  I regret not having taken a picture of the sad sight.  We were approached and asked if everything tastes all right and we said other than the 45 minute wait for an appetizer it was fine.  The lady than went on to question us with an attitude of really did it take that long and we were like yes it did.  Again no apol
3479;I can honestly say I have been ROYALY disappointed every time I go here for lunch...or breakfast for that matter.  Let's start with breakfast, apparently Dijon and honey mustard "are the same"...ahhh nooo they are not. I didn't even realize they decided on this 'fact" until I bit into my sandwich which ended up in the garbage.  Now onto lunch, the sandwiches (veal) are soggy and gross their fries are tasteless and today was the icing on top of the cake where I got a Greek salad.  They asked me if I wanted olives..well yea I do it's a Greek salad but thanks for asking. Then they start pouring balsamic dressing on the salad..BALSAMIC!!  so I ask "what is that?" and I the reply I get is "this is popular, you can try it".  No, I really don't want to try it.  I didn't ask for a garden salad, i asked for a Greek salad. I then learned they don't even carry Greek dressing. Not too many things in life upset me this much but messing with my food does. Mark my words this is the last time I will step into Pesto Cafe. I
3480;Unfortunately, it looks like Pesto has been pounded out of existence. The shop's been closed since the new year. Rumour has it a Starbucks is soon to follow. One can only dream...
3481;Not impressed with the quality of the food. We had ordered the sizzling fajitas, grilled salmon and a kids meal. Not appetizing, didn't seem fresh and tasted all right a bit disappointed. The ambiance is just about all right, service was friendly, bu don't think will visit again.
3482;The McDonald's located at the Queen & Church intersection is like a casting call for A&E's intervention. This location seems to attract an oddball customer base, the kind of customer base that freebases in the back alley behind the restaurant. If you're looking for a decent McDonald's make the extra 5 minute walk down Queen St, inside the Eaton's Centre.
3483;Being McDonalds and selling pseudo food is bad enough, but the service and clientele make it that much worse.In many ways I am glad the locations closest to home are the worst - easier to avoid the temptation of grabbing a quick snack!If you love their breakfast sammiches like my hubby does, go to the Front Street location, a little further but better service and no sketchy clientele.
3484;You have to ask the cashier for access to the bathroom. And they buzz you in. Toilet not flushed. There was no toilet paper. The cashier had to go in and refill (No access to the men's washroom). The toilet seat not really secured to the toilet. The seat was all wet. The toilet also did not seem secured to the floor as it was twisted and there was markings on the floor where the toilet should have been. The floor was wet and sticky. Smelled strange.  Disgusting bathroom. There was a Person who asked if I could buy them a meal.
3485;Horrible customer service. I was there to try out the new poutine. I ordered one thing and it took them 10 minutes to make it. It wasn't busy at all, around 4 people ordering and some people that ordered after us got theirs first. The location is really sketchy. Not a place you would sit down and eat.When I saw them making my poutine, they put in whatever fries was left. They gave me a small layer of fries (so little that you can see the bottom of the container). I went to ask them is it suppose to be this small? I paid $4 for less than an amount of a small fries... They say its suppose to be a small fries except when I searched online, its actually suppose to be between the size of small and medium.Ripping me off and lying to me. I'm never going to this mcdonalds again.
3486;I'll start off with the good of this place.It's just a block away from my place, so it's very convenient and 24-hours which is a plus when you want something gross at 3am, lol.There is a manager here that I really like, unfourtunately I've never gotten his name. But I think he's Indian? Don't quote me on that. The staff that work in the morning for breakfast are fantastic. It seems though, that they put all their good full time workers on in the morning and shove all the poor part-time students on in the evening and late-night. I do not envy the junk that those guys have to deal with at this location.Now, on to the REAL reasons I'm writing this review.As previous posters have said, this place becomes a crack den at certain times of the late evening/night. You get harassed for money coming into the restaurant, harassed for money and food while inside, and harassed once again when leaving. You might even get asked two or three times by two or three different people while in line. The staff do nothing 
3487;Yo for real what is the deal with this location I get the bacon egg bagels for the sauce and they never sauce it up it's like they don't know how to sauce every other mcdonalds I've gotten the number 6 from , abundantly sauced the sauce on those things  can bring zombies back from the dead everybody working up in there are a bunch of sauce haters bring back the sauce!- stay saucy San Diego
3488;This McDonalds is among the worst.  Now that they've gone to the self checkout it's worse then ever.  I ordered a simple meal for myself and two boys.  The meal took 15 minutes from Payment to receiving the food.  I talked to the manager, showed her the time of purchase and the time on my watch when we received the food.  All she offered was to refund the price of French fries.   What a joke.  This isn't fast food.  Unless you go through the drive thru you aren't a priority at this MCD.   TIP to Mcd.   Reward the people who aren't lazy and idling their cars in a drive thru.  So pi$$ed off!!Food was stone cold too.   Thanks for nothing Ajax mcd.
3489;Let me start of by saying looking at the menu it looked extremely satisfying... But I was wrong. I ordered a few things to go and I ended up waiting a half an hour, in these kind of circumstances it would be understandable if the resto was busy, but it was dead. My expectations got even higher considering the fact that it took forever to make my salad, potato skin and wings. Once I got my food I was eager to eat it. As soon as I opened my salad my appetite was gone. My salad had no dressing on it, the cheese and olives didn't taste like cheese and olives, my chicken was tasteless, my salad was old. Overall it just looked like they soaked my salad in water. As for my wings they turned out soggy. And last but not least the potato skin was plain, I had to add salt to add some sort of flavour to it. Overall it was a bad experience.... I really hope they make changes because it was not worth my money and the waiting.
3490;I'm not sure if it's a chain thing, but every Wild Wings i've been to, every visit is the same.Mediocre bland food, lousy service, empty restaurants. This visit was no different.Our group of 7 walked in on a Wednesday night, 4 of us got food, 3 only got drinks.3 of us asked for drinks that weren't available, including cider which was very surprising.I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The taste was eh... Mediocre, not enough sauce. My salad was actually quite delicious but it is hard to screw up salad.My only big concern was that my food was served on a plate you'd see in your own kitchen, not a restaurant style, which I found weird.My husband had a chicken sandwich which he actually enjoyed.Our server was completely absent. She would disappear and only check in on us every 25-30 minutes or so.At the beginning of our meal, we told her separate bills, at the end she said she forgot, so she went around to each of us to figure out what we ordered. She could not keep the orders straight and ended wa
3491;Ordered here on occasion that the Mrs. And I couldn't locate the menu for another Chinese Food restaurant that delivered in our area that we order from often. Our meal consisted of Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Balls, Vegetable Shanghai Noodles, and Lemon Chicken Stir fry. The rice was fine, not amazing, but fine, that being said it was the only item that was almost enjoyable. The Chicken Balls would've been more delightful were it not for a rather odd tasting sweet and sour sauce that tasted old and dull. The Vegetable Shanghai Noodles lacked taste and texture. Worst of them all was the lemon chicken stir fry, which failed to deliver on the lemon chicken. Amidst the entire bowl, lemon chicken filled merely a tenth of it. Now it wouldn't be so bad either, were it not for the sad truth that I couldn't bite through some of the undercooked vegetables. Needless to say, my wife and I won't be ordering here again. Ever. Again. Seriously.
3492;Ho lee chow? More like holy crap!!!! I have never eaten such bad food in my life and I've been to a 3 star hotel in cuba to eat. Their food is bland,  sauces are oily and taste nothing like they should taste like. Not to mention I separated the meat in both my entrees and each had a soup spoonful of meat at most. I have pictures as well but not sure if I can upload them here.  Moral of the story is if your hungry your better off raiding your neighbors garbage can for food than ordering from here.
3493;I was about to write a scathing review about this place but, reading the other reviews I see that the world beat me to it.  Consider that bullet dodged.
3494;The first time I ate their food, I ordered delivery once and never again. Had I known the proportions for how much I was paying, I'd never have bought their food. Ridiculous.
3495;I got takeout from here tonight and it ruined my night. I wish I just mustered up the energy to cook. This is so bad. Why didn't I look at the Yelp reviews before I ordered. I didn't know Chinese takeout could be this bad. I ordered a tonne.Chicken chow mein. Wonton soup. General Tso chicken. Vegetable beef. Each dish is literally the worst version of itself I've ever tasted. Everything is bland, soggy and slimey. Tastes like survival bunker food. I would literally prefer to eat several plates of plain raw broccoli. I'm not overexaggurating. It's that bad. Whatever they did in the kitchen made it worse than just raw produce. I'm so depressed. Don't get food from here. There's never an excuse.UPDATE : CAPTION FOR MY PIC: "PUN CHIN BAG" *wide eyed face, nodding head, pointing to brain* yeah. I thought of that.
3496;It was not good at all and expensive I had the lemon chicken stir fry  and all it was a bunch of onions and green peppers with literally 6 small pieces of  chicken  paying  Almost 11 dollars for that it is to much I will never eat  there again
3497;I have given this place quite a couple of chances now (it unfortunately being the only chinese place that does delivery in my area) and I have been incredibly dissapointed every single time.Not that they even have the worst food around. When I do get my order it's usually alright tasting, at least for something I'm not expecting miracles from. But every single time there is some problem with my delivery. I've gone through almost every scenario now and I'm just tired of it to the point that I must give a bad review. In almost every single case the driver has delivered the food a good hour to two late (that is an hour or two PAST their 45-60 minute estimate) and almost every time the food is cold and has to be reheated even if I somehow get a chance to eat it right away.Here are some examples:1) The driver couldn't find my bulding because he was expecting a house. I should add that I made it clear in the online form that my location was a business and not a house. I called in and asked if they had a late p
3498;Absolutely the worst food -- not just Chinese food, but food in general -- I have ever had delivered in my entire life! Not to mention, incredibly expensive for small portion sizes! That said, I'm glad the portions were small because it was less for me to throw out in the garbage. The overall flavor is just, sour and tangy. Almost as if it's completely spoiled. Hot garlic wings: 4/10Vegetables with tofu: 3/10Cantonese chow mein: 0/10Garlic beef: 1/10Vegetable fried rice: 6/10Overall: 2/10 = 1 star rating
3499;I ordered dinner for oneThe General Tao was soggy and the container was filled more with broccoli (raw) than chicken..The beef fried rice was stale, and there was very little beefThe spring roll was not crispy and soaked in oil, took one bite, wiped the oil off my lips and fingers and threw it out.The cherry on top...the fortune cookie tasted like it was made from cardboard.I read a few different websites, everyone complains about the food...How does this place make money? How is it still serving food to people? Worst food ever eaten in my life.
3500;I used to like the old HLC for tasty, if expensive, Canadian Chinese food.Since they went out of business, a few franchises have cropped up using the old name. They're still kind of pricey, but the taste and quality is GONE.i was offered a measly 10% discount on my next (nonexistent) order when they screwed up my ginger beef. I settled for a replacement, when I should have insisted on a refund. The pork fried rice is easily the blandest I've ever tried, and after I got my beef, two hours after ordered, I couldn't eat it (and I'll eat doritos, so no food snob me), it was that disgusting.ugh. if I could give it no stars, I would.
3501;How does Swiss Chalet run out of chickens on a Saturday evening??Never have I seen so many staff doing so little and confusing each other.  Hmmm maybe I just answered my question!
3502;Had lunch here with the family on Easter Sunday, staffs are rude and very unaccomodating, you know the feeling when they are only there for the pay and not to serve the customers. We're never coming back to this store, EVER.
3503;They deserve LESS than 1 star. I decided to get the Korean BBQ menu with 3 other friends. After cooking some meat, our BBQ plate needed to be replaced and we pointed it out to the waitress. When we did, she said "I know, I know". It took maybe 30 minutes for her to give us more water. Most meats were unmarinated (e.g. wasn't richly seasoned as per their menu), all BBQ plates came ungreased making meats prone to sticking and the plate burning. She and the owner were micromanagers, that is: monitoring how you use their stove. They seem to not care at all about replenishing your water, side dishes or utensils. The cost of the above was around $27 per person - cash only - and the waitress actually counted our payment to make sure we gave a tip. They are overpriced for probably the worst service I've had so far - regardless of cuisine - in Toronto. Contrary to its name, there's nothing really "real" about this restaurant, other than real bad service. You're honestly much better off just ordering a bucket of chicke
3504;Absolutely hate this place！too many rules！it seems like eat in a prison！One of the female waiters is so so rude...this is the 【first time】 and 【last time】 to eat in this BBQ restaurant！
3505;Their policy of only allowing you to pick your own meat after 8 plates is ridiculous. Not only were you not allowed to pick what kind of meat to have next, their services was lousy and the food wasn't that good. The boss was very rude and had a bad experience overall. Don't go there. It's not worth the price and there are better Korean BBQ restaurants in Christie. HORRIBLE!!
3506;All you can eat..8 different dishes of meat BUT COMES IN RANDOM ORDER.  So what you actually get is: cheapest cheapest meat, cheapest meat, cheap meat, cheap meat.....by the time you get full you still don't get the quality meat you wanted..and you have to pay extra for what you didn't finish.  They would take back the uncooked meat and it makes me wonder if they just serve it to the next customers who comes in.  Shit customer service.  The guy would just throw all of the meat on the grill without asking us, then kept on coming over to our table demanding how we should cook the meat, and kept on turning off the grill when the meat wasn't even fully cooked.  Im usually a very generous tipper, however I was never ever demanded by anyone of how much I should tip.  I was not at all satisfied with the meat (pork, chicken, spicy pork, then spicy chicken.....where is my bulgogi? Where is my samgypsal? Where is the meat I was coming for?) nor was I satisfied with the customer service.  And even so I was still goi
3507;If I could give it negative stars I would. Bryan is incredibly rude to his staff there, also incredibly rude to customers. Things that come with AYCE at all other Korean BBQ restaurants that doesn't come with your meal at Bryan's:- Lettuce- Extra sauces - Refill of side dishes- rice- soup- the ability to cook your own food and eat at your own pace and choose your meats- reasonable service My friends and I have been to a lot of Korean BBQ places this place has been by far the worst, watching him cuss in Korean at his servers and going around yelling at customers for things they would do in any other KBBQ restaurant.Just no. Do yourself the favour.
3508;Must avoid. As soon as we walked in, we regretted it. No server was on site. Just the owner and the kitchen lady. There was no customers, but a table was full of dirty dishes and wasn't cleared until we were done. We ordered short ribs, but the owner said they weren't fresh today. That should have been the sign to get the hell out of there, but we were hungry... Meats were cut too thick, resulting in longer cooking time. When we ordered a second round, the owner seemed annoyed and kept emphasizing he would have to charge us if we didn't eat everything. All in all, horrible dining experience. Avoid at all cost.This place definitely does not provide "solid KBBQ".
3509;Attention was great,  but the food really bad, and the side dishes are not a big deal, On top of that they don't take credit cards or debit. Very disappointed.
3510;Banchan (side dishes) are tasteless and very scarce. Prices are steep for such a run downed looking place. Pay for rice? Are you for real? Not impressed. This is not a place for Koreans to go to, it may be acceptable and praised by non-Koreans but this is far from a true Korean BBQ. They don't give u the true fillers that you should get for your BBQ! Tsk tsk! You should be ashamed to call yourselves real Korean. If I could give this place 0 stars I would.
3511;0/5 if I could!!!!!!!! Worst experience of my life. We had the special #2 ayce, but it is NOT AT ALL,  all you can eat. The servers, although nice and attentive, will start to get on your nerves when they start turning off the grill while you are still cooking (to save gas?). I came with a group of 7 and we're given two tables to sit next to each other. Side dishes and appetizers come in huge portions and you thus likely won't get a chance to try a bit of everything. Kept arguing with us that we needed to finish the gigantic piles of meat (they bring it out one dish at a time, but three the first time), before we can order another dish. You can order kalbi only once, as they are "expensive" . Owner is completely insane and obnoxiously rude to us. They would not allow our table to share anything, even though we are all paying the same price. Kept reminding us that we will be charged for leftover cooked foods. At the end, they added 10% service charge. Rules are ridiculous, management a horror, and the establis
3512;The worst Korean BBQ I ever had. The All-You-Can-Eat option is really really a bad choice, for that it does not have the varieties, and they would easily run out of your appetite. In addition, no real waitor seems to present there, instead just the owner and an old lady.
3513;The WORST OF WORST place ever When I went there, a waiter was not kind and i was not sure the meat was fresh. Anyway i do not recommend this place.
3514;THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE! I have no idea how this place is still open. Beware when you go with the All You Can Eat menu, because that's exactly what you will need to do to not be robbed by this place. They will bring out the cheapest meat first, in huge quantities, setting you up for failure to finish your order. Anything you cannot manage to finish will be charged. This rule is typical for AYCE, but quite difficult to follow if the food is absolute crap. It felt like they purposely make the food unappetizing so you can eat less and charge you for whatever you do not finish. We apologized and told the server that we cannot finish the kimchi pancake because it tastes horrible.... to which she replied "you have to finish it or I will charge you and pack it for you to go." Not sure what makes her think I would want to take it with me to enjoy at home if we already did not want to eat it there. The soup was also very unappetizing. If you are craving Korean Barbecue, spend your money elsewhere. You w
3515;This place is a ridiculous rule on food DO NOT GO THERE, or you will regret my first time try also my last.the price are expensive CASH ONLY f...king scam .
3516;This is hands down one of the worst restaurants I've ever had the misfortune of dining at in my lifetime. I came here with my friend who wanted to eat at an all-you-can-eat Korean barbecue restaurant. We came here on a whim without checking reviews first as we were walking around Korea town. Big mistake! We decided to order option 2, which includes an all-you-can-eat portion of your choice of 3 meats, a choice of soup, and a choice of appetizer for $24.95. We ordered the steak, chicken, and bulgogi. We were told that we each had to order the same soup and appetizer. The first thing to come out was the chicken and steak, as well as the sides. The steak plate was 4 pieces of a very cheap cut. The chicken plate was piled high with with pieces of nothing but dark meat. All of the chicken pieces were very fatty and it looked very unappetizing. The steak was completely unseasoned, absolutely no flavor at all, just cheap beef. The chicken was only picked at because of all of the fat.  We had to keep asking for our a
3517;How have people given this place 5 stars? I may not be Korean but I'm married to one, all my friends are Korean, I've been to Korea and I know what real Korean tastes like. It's not this place!  It looks like a true Korean BBQ from the outside but far from it when it come to service, quality, quantity and taste onto inside.Ban chan is horrific. Selection? There is no selection and the quality and taste just makes you want to spew!I didn't do AYCE, I went for BBQ at $12.99. The pork belly was rubbery and tasteless.  The quantity of meat given was pathetic.  What a minute, this is supposed to be Korean BBQ? Where's my rice? Oh wait, you have to pay for it. Absolutely ludicrous. Where's the marinated thinly sliced green onions to go with the wrap? No mushrooms? Really? Chunks of onions, instead of serving it in thinly sliced rings? People that think they know Korean BBQ truly don't if they rated this place more than 1 star. I'm begging you all! Please do not support this place, they do not deserve any reco
3518;Why is this place still even open? If you're even thinking about going here, DONT. If you're there right now, RUN. It's even more embarrassing that its run by Korean people and in Korea Town.
3519;NEVER COME HERE!!!! Dont come here, they force you to eat all the cheap meats before they serve you the good stuff (like samgyupsal). You're not allowed to not cook the meat dish you don't want to eat and then ask to receive the next one even though they say that uneaten raw meat will not be charged, only the cooked ones. They're tricky and difficult people... NEVER COME HERE!!!!
3520;Didn't like it. The whole place is dripping in grease burners are covered with caked on food. Forks and knives covered in caked on food. Utensils were not consistant. The water they brought to our table in an old scratched up container from the dollar store with chipped plastic and again a nasty film all over the rim. We gave them some cash for trying, but left without eating. Will never step foot in there again.
3521;A group of us went to eat at Bryan's BBQ after we discovered Joon's Restaurant was closed every second and fourth Tuesdays. There are a ton of Korean restaurants in the Bloor and Christie area but Bryan's happened to be across the street and they had an all you can eat barbeque so we decided to give it a try.It's been a while since I've had All-You-Can-Eat (AYCE) and when I do it's normally Japanese, which tends to be pretty good with a wide of variety of food to choose from. However, we left Bryan's BBQ less than satisfied. There are two options if you decide to have AYCE. Special #1 is available at $18.99 and with this combo you get a random assortment of meats that comprises of beef, chicken and pork. At least we know we're not getting some random meat dish.   The other option, Special #2 gives you more of a flexibility in that you can choose which meats to BBQ.We went with Special #1, as we were not picky with what we wanted and really, how can it go wrong - we all enjoy different types of meat and 
3522;DO NOT GO HERE! Absolutely terrible. I honestly don't understand how they are in business. It's all you can eat, however didn't allow me to pick what I wanted to eat. And if I decided to choose, I had to pay more?!
3523;This restaurant claims that it is all you can eat. The servers who do not speak English well advertised this when we came in. The server told us that you can only order Kalbi - a beef short rib on their menu once and you can only order 3 items per round. When our second round came around we were not able to order Kalbi again. This is extremely disappointing because this is the only item I wanted to eat. It is safe to say that they are NOT "All You Can Eat" and that I will NEVER return. Their customer service was terrible.
3524;Not a true all you can eat. For the premium menu you get to pick 3 meats which are super sized. Not allowed to order more meat until you finish it all. You can't even get a small portion of everything of your choice like at other Korean BBQ. Its more like eat 3 big orders of meat not all you cab eat.
3525;Holy...I should have checked the reviews before going there.Last time I went to this place was probably 5 years ago and can't say I had a bad experience but this time it was totally the opposite.I'm probably going to repeat what many others are saying, but it's the truth.First thing , if you're only 2 people better go somewhere else! We got full after the first serving. They will bring the same size no matter if you're 2 or 20! Was it worth paying $24.99 per person? HELL NO! For the price you get a choice of 3 meats. We ordered regular beef which was okay then there was another beef which I'm almost certain was for stew and not BBQ(so hard to eat). On top of that there was so much of it(oh and you have to pay it if you're not done, can't get a substitute) Haha and the pork...first time the guy brought the dish it looked nothing like the picture. It was so fat! We had to return it and got another dish of the same but actually looked as it should have been. So much inconsistency! I imagine everyone is gett
3526;One server on Sunday night is a bad idea, who is really nice and doing his best. Mean owner who insisted on us paying more tips, in addition to yelling at the poor server. Outright robbery. Cash only. It's 2015. Let alone the strict rules you have to follow for the "buffet" price you pay. Amazing how greed can drive people to such indecency.
3527;I had the most terrible experience here. Food quality was okay. But the service is beyond belief. I was cooking the meat and the owner comes to our table and rearranges the meat saying you should keep the meat near the center or something. I found it really weird of him but I said "okay......?" he went away. After I asked him to change the grill since this one has gotten charred from using it for long with different types of meat, he complained to me saying that was because we didn't keep the meat on the center but I'll change the grill I was thinking "okay.......? Doesn't the grills usually become charred from use and other places just change them on their own.....?" this was all great service in comparison. After the owner changed the grill he placed all the meat in the grill himself and said we charge for uneaten cooked meat but not for uncooked. I thought "okay.......? Does that mean you reserve uncooked meats that went to other people's tables already?" and I took some off the grill since he put way too 
3528;The worst place to go for Korean BBQ ever!When I get there for all you can eat bbq, man who looked like the owner of the restaurant kept turning off the grill. He told me it is difficult to clean the grill when meats are burnt, but THE MEAT WAS NOT FULLY COOKED YET!!! Did he want me to get food poisoned or what??? I asked other waitress to turn the grill on, and she did, and the owner came back and TURNED IT OFF AGAIN!! I am not mentioning how RUDE he is! He is rude to customers, and I saw he was yelling and shouting to poor waitresses. Wow.. what a place....I am never ever going  back to that place again.I recommend some other bbq place. This is the last one I am going for bbq.
3529;I m gonna start off this review with my brother and mother got food poisoning from this place. The service in this place is slow, but it's  alright, the server seems nice but the way you have to order food seems surprising odd to me(it makes me feel uncomfortable). Foods are meh over all for that price, definitely not recommended.
3530;Dear Bryan,You cannot demand a tip from your customers.  There is no "rule" in Canada that says one must give a tip despite stale sidedishes, telling us to rush and cook everything, and your frequent price increases for things that were free just a short while ago.  No tip = unhappy customer.  Never ask for a tip again! And stop your price increases.  Seriously the prices go up every time I go there!
3531;It's very frustrating when you have the waiter forget about what you order ALL THE TIME!! (Seriously, I have to remind him everytime when I order anything)And they make you wait and wait and wait to get your meat, lettuce, sauce or side dishes. The worst thing is, they try to make you full by giving you a lot of chicken, and say you can't waste any meat.And if you want to take advantage of the lunch price, think again! Because they charge for each additional bowl of lettuce. Seriously?? My lunch actually ended up more expensive than the dinner price.Food-wise, things are alright. It's not bad, but nothing really special.So if you are really picky about services, Bryan's BBQ isn't the right place.
3532;CRAP! CRAP! CRAP!-the side dishes are absolutely atrocious. If you go to any decent Korean restaurant, you'll realize how bad it is here. The japchae (glass noodles) was bland and stale, and the kimchi wasn't fresh. Not much variety either.-terrible service--I was with Koreans and they (owner and waiter) focused on the other guests. I know why--they knew the Koreans wouldn't return knowing how bad the food is. -the meat is OK, but don't even bother with the samgyeopsal. Prices are average and portions were actually quite small.-you can't get excellent BBQ on Christie, but I suggest Korean Village instead. Although  a bit pricier, it's better in every way: side dishes, taste, and service.
3533;My friend and I walked it craving a korean bbq. First it smelled like fish inside an there were plates on the table next to us, probably the staff's dinner. They could have taken it away right away...The menu is very confusing as to what you can and mostly what you can't have. We took the $25 AYCE special because the special #1 didn't include appetizers and other stuff.So you can order 3 types of meat (for the two people), not 3 types each and small portions no no! Same you can pick one appetizer for 2. Food came in a very random order. One soup and then oh a bit of meat, after 20min here is the rice (we asked for it).We had 3 huge piles of meat. Meat was marinated and good but not thinly chopped at all. The opposite. I don't know if it's how it's supposed to be for korean bbq but I did not like that.The only veggie we had was lettuce and there were no sauces. Makes it even harder to finish all that meat... I feel like it's AYCE but they just try to stuff you with meat. I would like smaller portions o
3534;Worst experience ever.Food 8\10Service (young waiter) 9\10Boss 1\10The food was good, meat was fresh and tasty. There are a lot of rules so gotta be careful which ayce you choose. There is the $18.99 one and $24.99. I had the $18.99 ayce and there is no control which meat comes first. They have 8 different types of meat for this ayce set but comes out in "random" orders. Only 1 type of meat each time you order and you gotta finish it before starting another meat order. Wow was the portion huge! Obviously they won't give you beef at the beginning. We finished 4 types of meat (chicken and pork) and no beef in sight. Huge scam, random my buttocks.What's worst was their service particularly (only) the boss's service. He did not understand English that well and his attitude was the worst. He kept repeating himself over and over how you gotta finish your meat first before you can order. He was a total control freak over the way we cooked our food. We were just moving the vent a liytle bit and he came over t
3535;The food here is alright, but the overall experience wasn't the best. Like others have mentioned, the service was pretty terrible. The owner was there and he pretty much came over to yell at us a few times for various reasons.First of all, it's not true AYCE. Basically they only let you order certain items for certain amounts of people. For example, we only had 3 people at our table so they wouldn't let us order the noodles. Okay - whatever. Also, they don't let you order a new item until all of the items on your table are finished. They gave us one bowl of soup and told us we had to finish it first before we got our second bowl. I get it.. wasting food is not cool. But I don't feel like we should be treated that way either. So, we were allowed to order 3 raw meats to cook. They staggered the meats to come out one by one so by the time we finished cooking the beef - which was quite quickly since we don't like to eat it well done.. the stove was left on and beginning to char. The server did not tell us we 
3536;On walking in -- two other parties were seated. There were ~2-3 servers on the floor as well as a middle aged man who I assumed to be the owner or manager.I'd come here once before, on a busy night where the only server was swamped, so although I found some of the rules strange, I decided to try it again later.This time, we opted to order the meat a la carte and ordered the  and Short ribs. Both of these dishes are priced at well over 10 dollars.Not even kidding they served us two pieces of short ribs and a small plate of the other beef. Furthermore my friend ordered a Bulgogi with rice and it came out when we were almost done our meal. We considered cancelling it, but she was really hungry so decided to wait  a bit longer. Again it was a few morsels of meat with mostly burnt tasting rice and vegetables. For such a simple dish I don't understand why it took so long to come out when there was (by this time) only one other party finishing up their mealThe service was okay at first, but as I adjust the h
3537;Best way to describe this place is, eating at someone's house and feeling really uncomfortable because the host is overbearingly micromanaging. I felt like a child again, being told what not to do with their stove and how we should be cooking the meat. For instance, the waitress told us that the grill pan tends to burn faster if we have it heated on, with no meat cooking on it. Or how we MUST keep all the meat directly below the vacuum vent and turn the stove off if we're done cooking the meat. She literally came over to our table every 5 minutes, repositioning the vacuum vent in the same place, turning off our stove when our meat wasn't done cooking, and lowering the heat when the meat clearly needed more time to cook. What a shame too, because the food itself is really good. But I would never come back here. I wonder which started first the micromanagement or bad business, because I cant imagine why anyone would be so overcontrolling unless their business is going bad and they're trying to save money o
3538;I feel like I'm being generous by giving this place one star.  As you can see from my reviews, I rarely ever give a "1 star rating" to any place and when I do, it's usually for one single reason: horrible customer service.  And this place lived up to it too. My boyfriend and I decided to go on a Sunday night.  The place itself was pretty well-lit but was definitely run down and seen better days.  It was a husband & wife operation (with chef(s) at the back).  1. $19.99 vs $24.99The first mistake we made was to go for the $24.99 option where you got soup as well as dumplings (steamed/fried)/rice cakes/lettuce/grilled vegetables/kimchi cake.  If you had a table of 4 or more, you had the option of jap chae as well.  DON'T GO FOR THE $24.99 option.  SO not worth it.  The soup was SO disgustingly salty, I thought I was going to suffer from dehydration.  When we told her to remake it, the woman brought back an equally salty soup.  They also pile a bunch of chicken for you because it's the cheapest meat.  Th
3539;TLDR: Just stay away from this place, service is non-existent.My fiancé and I walked into this place after a last min decision to go get some BBQ while driving through Korean Town. Usually we look at reviews, but we didn't this time because we walked in on a whim. Worst mistake ever.I'll start at the beginning. We got seated and looked at the menu. It was explained to us that the cheaper of the two options they have, means that we get "random" dishes sent to us every "round". We didn't like the sound of that, so we opted for the more expensive option. In hind sight, we probably would have been better off with random, because I'm not even sure we got the dishes we ordered anyway.We ordered the short ribs, marinated pork, Bolgogi seafood tofu soup and kimchi pancake. After about 10-15 mins, we finally received the short ribs... Which we devoured in pretty short order as we were pretty hungry. Then we waited and waited and waited, then after many attempts to get the servers attention, one of the girls fina
3540;DO NOT GO HERE!Brutal. Absolutely brutal. The owner is a food nazi with ridiculous rules. First off what kind of all you can eat provides 8 options but you are only allowed to order 3 at a time?  What's more, you are not allowed to order any more until you finish all three you order and then you may only order another 3. Better yet they give you huge amounts of the cheap stuff and only a little bit of the expensive stuff that of course comes 10 mins later. Want to be a even more impressed?  How about how they load the cheap meat all on to the grill so that u have to finish ALL of one thing before you can eat another?  Or how they turn off your grill when they say your food is done. And how they basically offend you and imply you are stupid for overcooking when they are really just being cheap on their gas. Let's continue by also saying that your leftovers no matter how few will be weighed and charged at a rate of $5/100g if you have any leftover. I had about 2 oz left and he demanded I finish or he woul
3541;This is the worst place I have ever been to, especially the customer service. I went there and I lost my appetite when he was putting the food on the grill so when I went to tell him I don't want all you can eat and just charge me for what I had and they refused. The way he was speaking was so rude and when I told him I wanted to speak to the manager he turns around and he said he was the manager. Are you kidding me? You were very rude from the beginning and you are claiming you are the manager? So I told him I want to speak to the owner and all of the sudden the owner went to get something and if I wanted to wait for him, meanwhile it was a she and I could hear them talk to her in the background. So I told him I will wait. So am waiting..and waiting......so he comes back and he charges me anyways. Are you kidding me? This is the worse service ever and PLEASE DO NOT go to this place because everything is bad. From the customer service to the place and everything that comes with it. I have been a waitress for 
3542;Random walk-in around 10pm on a Saturday night.  The strange AYCE rules others posted about are alive and well, so were the OCD behaviour of the owner.  Both are both as comical, annoying, and irrational as others have noted.  We had the steak, pork belly, and chicken.  Meats were not good quality - steak was extremely chewy, and the pork belly had zero flavour chicken was decent.  One of my DCs informed me that in traditional Korean BBQ certain meats are served not marinated (neither the steak nor PB were marinated)...fine, but pork belly, even without marinade, should have flavour (fat IS flavour baby!), but it was literally tasteless I stress this, not bland, but actually tasteless.  The steak was chewy to the point of not being edible - granted we did overcook it a bit, but it shouldn't have rendered the meat inedible.For the sides we ordered the soon tofu soup and seafood pancake, as well as a pork bone soup a la carte.  All of these were good, albeit the soups a bit on the salty side.  We also r
3543;Service was super weird. The staff were extremely protective of the grill. The fire on the grill kept going out so we would turn it back on and a bit higher but the staff would literally rush over to turn the fire down, and a minute later the flame would go out again. The staff also kept turning off our heat when the meat (including pork) was still uncooked. This repeated for at least 3 times until we got annoyed and told them we wanted our meat cooked on higher heat. Even then, they still wouldn't really let us do our own grilling AT ALL. They watched us like a hawk and every time we tried to use our grilling tongs they would rush over immediately and take over. The first time I took it as attentive service, but after everything that had happened it was just too much. The meat also does not look fresh at all, with weird colouring. The lettuce was not washed clean. The this-is-ridiculous point for me was when they served us pork even though we ordered beef, and they insisted that it was beef when it was clear
3544;Writeoff: Bad selection and any purchase under $10 they will try to charge you a $1 addition to your debit or credit charge.
3545;I have gone to this place for years, and never had a problem.  This place changed hands a few years ago and the service now SUCKS!  Not as busy a store as it used to be (no surprise).  I will never, ever go back there again.  Ever!!  They had better start adjusting their attitude if they want to remain in business.  I went there for years under the old management and since it changed hands, less frequently due to some less than pleasant experiences with the check out staff.  I went back again today and this was the worst experience, to date.  The check out staff person treated me very disrespectfully and I will never go back to that store again.  I can understand now why the store appeared to be not as busy as it used to be on a Saturday and why it rates so low on Yelp.  It just goes to prove how poor service can determine where people decide to spend their money (or not).
3546;Worst location they don't turn on A/C here considering this location is down by front/jarvis which is a very good area it should be one of the best.
3547;Place is nasty.. sorry but it is...they always have a ton of pigeons in front as ppl keep feeding them.
3548;Order from this restaurant again is because it's closed by. And once again disppointed. Ordered a chicken pad Thai but to found out they gave me beef pad Thai when I got back to work
3549;Worst food ever!  The last time I have been here was about 2 yrs ago.  Food was tolerable then but today's experience was so bad that I felt nauseated half way into the meal.  The Thai chicken wings (appetizer) had no flavour. It was just badly fried in old oil.  The sauce it came with was basically sugar melted in red colouring.  One bite and I was regretting ordering it. The red beef curry with pineapple was a disaster!  Beef was extremely dry.  My jaw was sore from chewing two pieces of this not so flavourful beef (don't ask why I even gone for the second piece).   The pineapple in the curry was not fresh and looked brown and felt soggy when I touched it with my fork.  Pad thai that my friend had was so sour that they should have handed out Gaviscon as a side dish.  All in all, this is the worst restaurant experience ever.  I will never step back into this place again!
3550;I ordered food online this week from Thai One On for me and my teenaged kids. I paid approximately $75.00 on VISA and the food never arrived! We waited for two hours for the food before giving up and ordering from another place. In those two hours our calls were ignored (the line just rang continuously till the line disconnected), and our emails to Customer Support were never answered (they sent me a standard response saying that someone would contact me soon but, other than that, I got no response). It's now been almost two days since I ordered and paid. I sent them a follow-up email yesterday but I'm still waiting for a response from Customer Support. I told them that, at the very least, I want my money back. No response. I've been ordering food online for years and this ranks as the worst experience I've ever had, by far. Who keeps hungry people waiting for food that never arrives? Who treats their customers like crap by ignoring  phone calls and not answering emails sent to customer support? Who takes y
3551;WARNING, WARNING !! ( had to put one star because it wouldn't let me put ZERO STARS) Absolutely NO customer service . Ordered from them , the food was decent , the next time we ordered they got our address wrong ... Yelled at Us about it on the phone .. Brought us cold food  30 minutes late AND forgot one of our orders . When we called to explain what had happened they denied having our address on file from a previous order and blamed us for the address mix up and wouldn't comp ANYTHING . Instead of coming up with a solution they simply accepted the fact we will NEVER be ordering from them again. Not worth the risk of ruining your night from food arriving late and incomplete and POOR POOR customer service !
3552;Do not order classic pad thai....placed order for delivery and as soon as I opened the bag the smell was very fishy....tried a shrimp and it tasted off.  I called and spoke to someone on the phone who supposedly spoke to the manager and they just brushed me off... very poor customer service!
3553;Thai One On : Most Disappointing !  One of the worst place I've been too in terms of food and service ... All the food we ordered was Way too Sweet and Overpowering with Sauce ... Most disappointing was that we got all our main dishes served at different times rather than together.  We didnt get our last dish served until 15 min into our dinner  and they even forgot a Dish we ordered !  Upside: Decor is nice and presentation of food appetizing ( Just wish I could eat it ... LOL ). All in All : Wont go back ... ever !
3554;Terrible. Ordered a vegetable pad thai and a mango smoothie cause I wanted to play it safe but it was just terrible. The taste was so off, smelled funny and the presentation was like I was eating someone's leftovers. Mango smoothie also had a weird taste. Please do yourself a favor and just go to Thai Express if you want something close by. If not, jatukjak is also worth the travel.
3555;Tried this on just-eat a while ago, despite the poor reviews. I'd thought I'd give it a try. Well... bad choice! Haha.Settled for the Chicken Pad Thai. It was disappointing. The portion was tiny for dinner and well, not worth the price. No vegetables present at all, with the exception of maybe 5-7 tiny squares of tofu with the chicken and noodles. Tasted no where near to pad thai but at least it lacked the ketchup-y taste.I'll pass next time and actually adhere to reviews. Kudos to the delivery man though, he was very nice.
3556;Their hours of operation clearly mention open till 10:30pm but when we showed up at 9:40pm they refused service and said they can do take out only. We used to frequent this place alot but I'm not impressed with this lack of customer service. Not returning.
3557;Worst thai food ever... and the service was the poorest I have ever experienced in Toronto.Felt like a bunch of morons are running this show, and the server lady was the rudest one ever met...Will never go back, even if they offer free food...
3558;Decided to order delivery due to good reviews on just eat, which ended up being a horrible idea. The food took almost two hours despite multiple phone calls. When the driver came, he threw the food in our face and left without saying a word. We ordered chicken skewers and a shrimp pad Thai. The skewers were cold, and did not taste good alone. The only thing that made them palatable was the peanut sauce, and the shrimp pad Thai was disappointing to say the least. My boyfriend described the taste by saying it was similar to vomit.
3559;I'll give it one star because the food was edible and they gave good sized portion, however I was not impressed by the taste of the food at all. I ordered the chicken pad thai, spicy eggplant and coconut sticky rice. For the price, i expected the food to be a lot better. If you want real Thai food, check out jatujak..... Yummmmmmmmm..
3560;pad thai was soggy. it was bad. other locations prepare good food. good thing i used my GROUPON coupon.
3561;I give them one star, some staff have attitude and they are not polite with customers. And their coffee been tasting different he past couple of days especially the dark roast coffee.
3562;Filthy, and service is poor.  No or poor air conditioning.   Trash all over the floor.  When you ask for an iced coffee you get hot coffee poured over ice and it becomes Luke warm coffee...  Unbelievable.   Never again.
3563;iced coffee = hot brewed coffee + milk + ice cubes(you need to ask them to give you some)
3564;An unexpected jem I found while passing by and decided to check it out.  Since I am Ukrainian I was interested in their perogies from the start.  The staff kindly brewed a fresh coffee right before my eyes which was a nice touch.  Before ordering the perogies I might add that I had asked her how many and how big they were considering I was paying around $7.00 for one serving, which was a little steep if you ask me.  Well she said it would be average size and I believed it until I opened it up later to find that infact they were HALF the size of any perogy I have ever seen in my life and 3x more greasy!  I am shocked, and insulted as a Ukrainian myself and growing up with the food this was a poor excuse.  The whole place was tacky and an attempt wad made to appear fancy but that was a genuine fail. I'm actually sorry to write this but its true.
3565;Hair in my rotisserie chicken sandwich . Gross!!!!!They did replace it with a whispered apology , but they still presented the bill in full.Not what I expect from Swiss chalet.
3566;Food was alright as you might expect from a swiss chalet.  Unfortunately the staff here were very rude to us. I have been to many swiss chalets and I usually experience good service.  There was an issue with or young 6 month old child's child seat where they insisted on us putting her in a regular chair but we were not comfortable with that. They then refused us the use of a child seat.  They actually gave it to us they l then took it away.If you have young children AVOID this specific swiss chalet.  They made it clear to me they did not like to encourage families with young children here.If swiss chalet management is reading this then know the biggest issue we had was with the manager on location Saturday March 7 2015 dinner time.   Beyond the issue I described above this manager was incredibly rude to us.
3567;wing machine in the food court at 200 elizabeth street, TGH is absolutely to ve avoided. chicken wings were smallest I've had in several years and hey aren't sold by the pound. Flavor less  . owner will not pass te cocktail siracha,  instead he asks for 79 cents for 1.5 ounces calling it a dipping sauce.not sure why anyone would put up with this crap.since food court doesn't have a pizza place, get rid of this bozo and install a real pizza kiosk. $ 7.89 for 9 wings. whoopee. I am so pissed I'm gonna write  the hospital president to saunter down there  for lunch  and sees  if he's proud of this safe excuse  for " restaurant".
3568;Food is not fresh and sits under the heating lamps for long periods of time. Food and sides are dry and lack seasoning. The owner is also rude and not very friendly. Do Not buy from this place.
3569;This was our second visit. Our first visit wasn't great - exceptionally slow service with an almost empty restaurant. The food was basic - nothing great but okay. We returned for our second visit because it was a party so we had no choice (we did advise the planners of the slow service but it was close to the venue we were all at that evening). The restaurant was well aware of our large group and assured us they would be staffed and able to accommodate us and we even agreed to a set menu (with a limited choice of main courses to choose from to make things easier for the kitchen staff). We arrived around 10:15pm and waited for drink orders to be taken from anywhere to 30-60 minutes, depending what table we were seated at, despite numerous requests to the manger for a wait staff member. Several people just gave up and went to the bar themselves. Of course, by this time we were all prepared to order our food but we're not able to order at the same time as our drinks so had to wait for the waitress to return with
3570;0 stars!Popped in for dinner with the fam and even though there were many visible empty tables were told it would be 15 mins to be seated...maybe sooner as they just had to clear some, but it still took 15 mins.  We took a seat at the bar to wait and ordered drinks.  The bartender was quick and friendly.When we did get seated, we were seated at the very back of the restaurant by the sliding doors and there was a draft.  We placed our order, got our drinks and an app and then were ignored.  Finally, fed up with waiting (45 mins after getting our app, no food, and no follow-up) we asked another waitress for our waitress and then her for our bill to leave.  The server dilly dallied around, served another table and then went to take an order from yet another table.  We spotted a manager and again asked for the bill as we wanted to leave and explained that we had already been waiting and he too dilly dallied around without bringing our bill.  It took us getting up and walking to the door to finally get their att
3571;Walk on by! There's a ton of cute a tasty places in the downtown core, or brampton in general, DON'T GO HERE. My husband, best friend and I went on a Sunday afternoon, happy to see $5 Cesar's. we were seated in the front of the restaurant by the windows, the sun was beaming in, and I had to try hide behind a pillar to get some shade. It took a good 20 mins to get our alcoholic drinks, due to the sun we all also asked for water as we didn't want to get too dehydrated with how hot we were. It took another 10 mins to get the water. 30 mins after the water, For apps we ordered the tempura green beans with ponzu sauce, and sliders. The beans were by far the best thing we received at all. The sliders had tiny patties that were black and dry as all hell. By this point we were starving though and my hubby and my friend shared those. I couldn't stomach them. For dinner I ordered the tilapia & shrimp in garlic butter with veggies and mash, my hubby ordered the buffalo chicken burger, fries & gravy, and my friend got 
3572;Terrible in every way possible. I went to this location and ordered a half mariboli wrap, with soup and a salad. The soup was cold, the lettuce in the wrap was brown, and the mariboli wrap was cold. Ive ordered this from other locations dozens of times, and never did it come to my table like this. Total pig-slop, half assed cooking techniques. Awful. The waitress was even ignoring us and drinking beer on the job, and we waited 30 minutes for refills, and we were the only ones in the restaurant. Avoid like the plague.
3573;I can't believe that we ordered 2 pizzas and a dish of spaghetti. After 1h and 5 mins they finally delivered the order. For one pizza they forgot to add the tomato sauce and for the other one they added something we didn't order. We asked to correct the pizzas. Another 20 to 25 minutes for them to correct one pizza and to provide the sauce for the order.If you want to wait 1 hr and 30 mins to get a simple  order (is it really that hard to provide 2 pizzas and a dish of spaghetti?) this is the place to go.
3574;One word. Disaster. That's it. Never again. We've tried it a few times. Each time is a disaster. I'm done with this place.
3575;I have been here twice and both times my order was so ruined I ended up not eating anything. The last time I went with my parents and my mom and I ordered the same thing: fettuccini with rosé sauce. My dad ordered soup. What we GOT was cold soup with no spoon, one fettuccini alfredo, and another fettuccini with NO SAUCE. I asked for both fettuccinis to be corrected. They were taken away. No spoon was offered. The fettuccinis came back, this time lightly tinted pink to give the impression they had bathed in the presence of rosé sauce before being wrung free of any moisture and delivered to us. I asked them to fix it and please add sauce. I also asked for a spoon so my dad could begin to eat his now-cold soup. The third time they brought back the fettuccini without sauce I was done. We'd been there for 1.5 hours and it wasn't even busy (maybe 10 tables were occupied).People I recommend this to: my enemies and people I don't like.
3576;How the mighty have fallen,I used to remember being hyped up on going to East Side Mario's as a treat with my parents, get some yummy pasta and infinite bread and salad to go with it. Yeah sure u still get the all u can eat bread and salad with your meal, but meh.Last few times I've gone the service was crazy slow when it wasn't even busy, in the warmer months there was a bunnnch of fruit flies around , and they gross me out , and that's not cool dude. Prices are okayyyyyish but heck, last time I went and got the baked penne Alfredo it came out cold and with verry little sauce, the cheese on top had literally chilled back to a non melty state, like comonnnn there seems to be less and less locations of ESM to go to, there must be a reason.... Don't blame Boston Pizza for taking your market share, step up your game cuz its only downhill from here as I seez it. Meh, don't bother going here. I'm finished with it now.
3577;Lousy service combined with their ever shrinking portions, I would not recommend this location.Food wasn't bad but this is big box.
3578;Terrible service, oily tasteless food, noisy restaurant. East Side Mario's used to be a fun place for a family dinner. Not anymore. The last time I was there, I couldn't finish my pasta because it was so oily --- and the portions weren't very big, either. Even the "endless" bread was smaller than it used to be.After sitting there disgusted by the food, we had to flag down the wait-staff for my bill because our server had disappeared. We tossed cash on the table and fled. Blegh. Won't go back.
3579;Not sure how this franchise has managed to survive with their prepackaged meals and wannabe Italian food. Had the ribs which was one of the very few meals I have ever had to return... cold and tasted terrible. Tried the pasta but could tell it was not homemade fresh, very bland. The staff couldn't care less. If your concerned about what your family eats and want good Italian or affordable food go elsewhere.
3580;This place used to be good but the past two years specially after renovations the quality of the food has gone down the drain. We still go back every once in a while cause it's walking distance to our house and my toddler loves pasta but every time we get disappointed! It's actually much tastier and cheaper to go to longos and get food from the hot meal section. Their foods amazing!
3581;Have come consistently to Aurora ESM for about 8ish years, and have posted a positive review before (good value/service/ decent food) but after two aweful visits in the last 6 weeks, we are done here. Yes, they comp meals if they are overcooked/inedible, but ya know what? My dining dollars are not compensated, because my family night out has been ruined, and my time and $$ is too valuable to chance incompetence. This place is understaffed (and I actually feel sorry for the staff, because they are clearly trying hard), the management has not been trained (can comp a meal, but is not actually watching the hostess, who struck off our names, forcing us to wait 30 min for a table of "10 min wait"),  is clearly not watching kitchen staff (30 min between salad and main, burned wrap and oily rice),  and appears to be under trained (asking staff for direction over and over)... The kitchen is now smoking as I type this..... last visit I was berated because they changed the seating policy (you are not allowed to seat yo
3582;our family was there for dinner last night.  The service was so slow, I thought we'd get breakfast too.  I mean, come on, 2 hours for a fixed dinner???  This place was much better when it was Trappers and it didn't survive.  I would start a contest for guessing when this one goes bye bye but what would be the prize?  We won't return to this location whatever the name ends up being.  Read the other reviews and stay away.
3583;This place is only getting 1 star because I can't give it 0 stars. There are no redeeming qualities about this place. 1. Service is terrible and nonexistent. I say nonexistent because our party at down for a good 30 minutes because we got any water or menus. And this was on top of all the staff ignoring eye contact and our asks for water. We could have prob gotten up, walked out the door, and nobody would have noticed or cared. When we finally waved down one of the waitresses, don't want to name her here, she was bustling all over the place trying to make up for the lack of trying on the part of her manager. Poor girl. The service was also horrendous because I got elbowed in the head by the manager. Yup, that's right. I got a pretty standard and disingenuine apology and that was it. Yeah the place was small but hitting your customers in the head, not cool. 2. Food was meh. Really wish this could have saved the day but in between waiting forever for everything, and feeling pretty much ignored, the raw sh
3584;Came in over the weekend to try out their summerlicious and I must say the experience was beyond disappointing.  We were pretty much ignored after being seated.  No server came with water, had to request for a high chair 3 times and after 25 mins,  had to ask if we could be given menus!   There was one individual server that was avoiding eye contact with our table from the time we sat down,  perhaps because he wasn't thrilled about looking after a party of 12 as we noticed he was only trying to look after the smaller tables.  The place is small in size and there did not appear to be any assignment of tables/sections for each server, he clearly just chose to avoid serving our table.  He also was the one that ignored our high chair request,  he seated people that came in after us,  gave them menus and took their orders.  It turns out this server was  actually the manager, how sad.  We finally were able to get a waitress there to help us out.  She was apologetic and tried her best take care of us.In terms of t
3585;Awful. This place is just a disappointment. My friend and I went here for Summerlicious on a Wednesday evening. It wasn't very busy but by 7:30pm there were more customers. By the end of the meal, we wondered if anyone could possibly enjoy their meals.We ordered the following:* Crispy Fried Calamari* New England Clam Chowder * 6oz Striploin Steak* Pannacotta* Apple CrumbleThe calamari looked decent but boy appearance can fool you. It was doused with a lot of salt, it was so bad and when adding lemon it made it entirely worse. It was hard to stomach. The clam chowder was very watered down and didn't wow me in any manner. To be honest even canned soup would have tasted better. The steaks we had were another disappointment. It was cooked medium rare, fine, I'll give you that but everything else was confusing. First off, we weren't given steak knives! Were we supposed to cut our steak with a butter knife? We had to wave down another server to get "steak knives" but the knives we received weren't very s
3586;Usually when I goto a restaurant and have a bad experience I just never go back.  But this particular visit leaves me with such a bad experience that I have to warn other people about this place.  We had a large family of 11 and and waited over 25 min just to get a menu.  We pratically had to beg for it. There was one waiter that made no eye contact with us for the whole night and just kept circling around doing nothing. (Which later we were told he was the manager)  Finally when we spoke to Sharla (which was the only waitress  doing all work)  She tried her best to accommodate us being how busy she was.  A good manager delegates his team and helps with the entire process.  A simple acknowledgment of how busy they were and an apology would have been the right thing to do.  Bad customer service is one thing from the manager, on topof that....he had tripped into my sister's chair and elbowed another party member in the head.  Yes he said sorry but was not sincere at all.  Really!!??  I dont think i ever wanted 
3587;The food was mostly good but the service was terrible. We went for my daughter's birthday dinner. We had to wait half an hour for a table even though we had a reservation. The salad arrived and it had no dressing so we ordered a calamari. The calamari was pretty good. Then we had to wait one and a half hours for the main course. The main course was pretty good but they cooked my daughter's steak too little. Then we asked if they would prepare the desert for us. Then our waiters said that the deserts that we had ordered from the beginning for summerlicious they had no more of. We had seen the people who came an hour after us were eating food before us. The time that it took from getting in to getting out was two and a half hours. To their credit, they did reduce our bill by one third.
3588;nothing wrong with customer, it was about the food. I research about this restaurant before I make decision I go but still disappointed. Something wrong with the noodle, the portion between meat and noodle were balance. I ordered the pork rib noodle large size and there are 5 pieces of rib only. Yes 5 pieces! I have to eat the second half bowl with soup.
3589;Bad service,  bad food. Hot noodle soup with no ac.  a bowl of noodle soup with only few meat and 2 thin slices of veg.
3590;My friend and I decided to try this place out but boy were we disappointed. This place is supposed to serve hand pulled and sliced noodles. We ordered the braised beef with planed noodle soup.  The soup base was bland and we had to season ourselves with salt, chili oil and lots of vinegar. The braised beef were tough and hard to chew and the so called hand cut noodles, we don't believe them to be made fresh and cut just before cooking cause in both our bowls, there were large chunks of noodles stuck together which made us wonder if they were precut and frozen. Even the bok choy in the noodles tasted like they were boiled in plain water. We definitely won't be coming back for a second meal.
3591;The waits are long here .They might want to make there staff drink some coffee .Ice cap machine does not work after 10pmDonuts that nuts they don't have any good ones after 2pm
3592;This location SUCKS. Customer service treats you like it's your fault they rolled out on the wrong side of the bed. No matter how unclear they are, if you mishear what they say they get SUPER annoyed. I understand if I was super rude or completely thick but what? Why isn't Tim Hortons making sure anyone working as a cashier actually knows how to treat a customer and receive orders? On top of all the rudeness they charged me for two Iced Capps. Really? They're mad at me for misunderstanding but it's fine for them to. Even more pissed off that when I said thank you (despite the repulsive customer service) I got no response-- ha! Never coming here ever again.
3593;This Tims is truly repulsive, always crammed with people and cars, and with abysmal customer service
3594;If we are talking about the drive-thru location (and not the sit-down location across the street), then this place is a disgrace to Tim Horton's. Sometimes it is just convenient to purchase your tea at a drive-thru so I don't expect quality service, but i do expect at least acknowledgment. Just came here to quickly purchase a tea. The woman on the speaker had the huskiest voice that it became difficult to understand her. When I kindly asked her to repeat herself, she seemed irritated and asked questions such as "size?" "order?"Come on! I prefer the location by Britannia and Terry Fox. At least they know how to greet their customers and respond appropriately if they are misunderstood or the customer misunderstood them.And if the husky voice could not be remedied by a cough/glass of water, then please understand that it will be especially difficult to understand you through an intercom.
3595;This Tim Hortons is the absolute worst when it comes to customer service. They never smile, when you pull up to the window they look at you and usually don't even say anything.  I say thank you every time I'm there and they just look away. Never once has anyone said you're welcome. I get it, it's busy but what happened to common courtesy?
3596;Okay.So this place used to be Lee's Thai Spring Rolls - with faded bamboo cuts shaped like a curtain outside and a burgundy curtain at the door. It had a nice decor and fairy authentic menu. I even worked there for a little while, so I can get free food.  It had some authentic items on it that made the place special it was very ambient inside with candle lights, making it a great spot for an intimate dinner with a friend or ..."friend"  and the place had been my favourite for YEARS. Then one day it changed to Family Thai and the bamboo was painted green - then it came off altogether and was replaced with  green paint and new tacky signage.I went there a few times in good faith - and to my relief the menu was the same - or so I thought. All the little menu items which made it special were gone - whhhy would you get rid of Thai iced tea iin a THAI place, I dunno, but there was some business logic I'm sure.There is 3 beef I have with this place.1. the price went up I used to recommend Lee's because even
3597;Pretty bad customer service.. delayed my order and then gave me under cooked pizza.. have no apologies what so ever...
3598;This place has the worst customer service imaginable! Out of all the pizza pizzas I've been to this is by far the worst.I came in here with my Jays ticket, to get my free slice of pizza since they had gotten 7 strikeouts. They tried to refuse me a cheese slice saying it didn't look like the other ticket they had just received. Despite it saying the same date, and where my seat was. There are a bazillion different looks to the Jays tickets. Sometimes people even have to print them out at home! He said I was "only giving him half a ticket", and it wasn't the whole one. Honestly I don't appreciate being treated like someone who is scamming pizza pizza for a free slice of Pizza. I don't even like Pizza Pizza! But it was a convenient lunch for me on a Monday... I have now gone back to work angry and pissed off. While I was standing there eating my cheese slice (because all four seats in the place were taken), the same guy got into it with a kid who was complaining there was onions on his cheese slice. He blew th
3599;Worst customer service.I tried to redeem a free cheese/pepperoni slice with my raptors ticket since they scored over 100 points against Miami on Jan 22. They didn't have any ready and said it would be 20 minutes since they had not started making one yet. I did not have time to wait so I asked if I could pay the difference for a signature slice. The cashier asked the owner and he said it would be $2. The actual price difference displayed on the menu shows the difference is $1.25. Long story short, after arguing about the made up premium and the owner yelling at me in front of other customers, I will never go back to this location again.
3600;Very Low quality food!!!!!!! Uncleaned cups ( it seems unwashed!), table, dishes,... even not cheap!If you want to test your self-anger control and practice fake smile ..here is the place. BTW, nice waitress.
3601;This is the most awful buffet that I have ever seen in my life. Scrambled eggs cooked until they are breaking apart. Bacon cooked until it looks like bacon bits. Sausages that have been cooked until hard. Fresh fruit that is brown and disgusting. It is clear they need a real kitchen staff fur to make simple breakfast foods. All for the low price of $15.99. What great value. A must!
3602;Putrid food...I don't have much else to say.  All the food is greasy and salty.  The worst I remember being the bacon which had a very distinct taste of mildew.  I will never go back there again.  That was a big mistake to go here rather than waiting for a table at Cora's.
3603;This place is shit tier. My expectations were pretty low going in the atmosphere sets you up for grungy, greasy, late-night breakfast food. Sometimes quick and dirty bacon and eggs is exactly what you need. Sadly, this restaurant misses even the lowest of low bars by a mile. It's not comforting, or nostalgic -- it's just vile. The water tasted like scum. The crepes with "strawberries" were actually just filled with strawberry ooze like the filling out of a cheap pie. Everything was disgusting. I would rather eat the peach cobbler out of a frozen dinner slathered across a piece of stale bread than taste those crepes again.The only redeeming factor was that the cashier at the front wasn't paying attention and misread the price on my bill. His incompetence saved me a dollar. Hooray.
3604;I went to this location last weekend for the buffet, and got an omelette at the omelette bar first it was watery inside and then I found a hair baked right into it. Then my daughter got some pancakes and there was a hair baked right into that also. Told the waitress I want to speak to the manager this brown idiot comes over and has the BALLS to tell me it wasn't a hair. He tells me don't worry I'll take care of the bill so he gives me 50% off I am soooooo disgusted with this reastaurant, my meal should have been free of charge. And NO I didn't put the hair in there myself it was baked right into both those items. I will NEVER go again. I give this location no star but unfortunately I have to
3605;This place is very bad from the service to the food.  Most places you go into for breakfast they will service you coffee take your order then when food arrives they will check on you while you have your breakfast if you want more coffee not this place you get you food your coffe and you won't see your server till they bring you the check .
3606;Awful service, had to wait 20 minutes to order and another 30 to get our food. We ordered pancakes, and when they finally got there we noticed they were the same ones they were offering at the buffet (mini pancakes). Taste was ok but didn't make up for the negatives. Expensive and lousy, would not go back and don't recommend it at all.
3607;I have had many family breakfasts here over the decades....used to love eating here.Now the prices are outrageous and you don't even get REAL maple syrup anymore. For the money we spend (our last bill for two adults and one child came to $65), the syrup should be authentic.  The sausages are always undercooked and when I ask for them to be WELL DONE...they still come to me not well done. I sent the sausage back and requested for them to be burnt....still not to my satisfaction. My husband and parents have decided we are done with Golden Griddle. Now we go to The Coach House for brunch and our bill is HALF of what we were paying at the griddle (same amount of food, cooked to perfection the first time and only $35).The Coach House does not serve real maple syrup either....but with the money we are saving we don't mind bringing our own
3608;Everything comes quickly and seems ok. At first. The coffee cups are square which makes drinking fun. But upon further eating, my friend's special $3.99 all-you-can-eat 10-grain pancakes taste "metallic". I'm disappointed but not surprised that processed cheese is used for my omelette. The toast is almost completely soaked through with butter. The hash browns taste chalky. SPOTTED: a cube of ham in my, "vegetarian" omelette. I'm too shy to bring it up to waitress. However, she notices that my friend is not eating her pancakes anymore. In a flash, she brings her own favourite, the buttermilk pancakes with free chocolate chips. I appreiciate the service, but that was a pretty sorry meal.
3609;The absolute worst. The waitress convinced us to get the buffet. Food was cold and disgusting.. for three people the bill came to almost $80 and it was the worst food we have ever had.. We honestly should not have even paid. AVOID.
3610;Despite promoting wifi, this restaurant will not let you sit and work at your table with a laptop! The manager at this location threatened to physically remove me for working here, despite the fact that I bought a meal, and half the tables were empty. I spent 75 minutes here and was polite, quiet, and yet was still treated rudely. Unbelievable.
3611;A few nights ago I $20 for extremely crappy food that I regret spending money on.  It was late and me plus a friend wanted some grub to eat on, there was a few choices.  We could've gone to the sushi place next to it (WHICH WE SHOULD'VE!) instead we saw "Free Wi-Fi" that drawn us in. Okay first thing we notice is a dirty restaurant.. seriously tables were sticky and the whole store was dark regardless of their lighting.  The washroom is extremely gross only go if you really have to, so nasty, smelly and not clean at all. I first ordered a "Belgian waffle with strawberry fruit topping with icecream" 8.99 well first of all NEVER came with icecream... the fruit topping was a white dark opaque color that I would say was spoiled.. so I called over a waiter and he said I could get something else off the menu for the same price.  I got a western sandwich that comes with fries and a salad (8.99) never got the salad either.. it was okay.  Much better than that disgusting waffle with putrid topping.. fries are cl
3612;Maybe it should be called the Golden Turd instead.  Awful.  Went here Saturday for a group brunch:1.  Buffet has little in the way that combines health and tasty.  Most of the offering are fatty and overly sweet.2.  Except for the omelet station there is little that could be called real cooking - most seems to be stuff made from mixes.  Bread and cake tackily presented in store containers!3.  Abominable coffee.4.  Servers kept trying to snatch plates away before we were finished eating.5.  Ditzizoid  server was more interested in counting the number of people at the table instead of brining things when politely requested.As my father would describe this in Yiddish:  chozzerai!
3613;the food is horrible. how do you mess up breakfast food!?if i were to bump the table the waffles would have disintegrated - they were so overcooked it wasn't even funny. waffles are not supposed to be super crunchy!
3614;This restaurant doesn't even deserve 1 star. The service & food were below standard. I don't recommend this place to anyone, not even my dog. It's sad to have a place like this still open with so many horrible reviews, what a joke!
3615;I was walking pass the restaurant and saw the chef having a smoke break out front... And picking his nose. This was the final nail in the coffin. This place already has a reputation for lousy And expensive food. Might as well go to Cora's next door or to the 24/7 Fran's diner across the street.
3616;This place is just plain gross. The eggs smelled like dirty dogs. The prices were high for the quality of food. The service was the only good thing. The pancakes were not fluffy and I barely ate any of my food. It is worse than an IHOP or Waffle House. I wish I would have never stepped a toe nail in this place.
3617;This is one of the most disgusting places I've ever eaten at and let me tell you... I've seen some sh-t.First of all the place is filthy and falling apart. it smells,the seats are dirty, the carpet was peeling off the floor and the walls were dirty and splattered with old food from 1998.we ordered the spinach swiss omelette with three pancakes - the pancakes were inexplicably chewy and tough (frozen). the omelette looked like someone threw up in some eggs and had no distinguishable listed ingredients.The french toast was something like 8 f-cking dollars for three chewy, MOLDY slices of toast and packaged butter from Chernobyl and some packaged sugar liquid called "breakfast syrup" in little containers.We also got a side of "perogies" because why the hell not.I'm sure you can guess how great they were. again chewy flavorless frozen little nuggets of history microwaved to perfection !our "food" took a very long time to be microwaved and our server came by once to take our orders, again to give us our
3618;The staff seemed pleasant, knowledgable about the menu and were very fast at delivering us our food and drinks.Unfortunately, I knew something was wrong when I saw no cap on the syrup, and a patch of fruit flies hanging on the wall beside it in our booth. It looks like an IHOP, only much crappier and scarier.I ordered the crepes, because I love crepes! Three crepes for 8 bucks? OMG what a deal!! The crepes were a great size, the batter was fantastic- until I got to the filling... Have you ever been to the fair, and ordered a funnel cake? Or DQ and ordered a strawberry sundae? That strawberry syrup that the poor over saturated strawberries are submerged in...that's what these crepes were filled with. Gooey, messy, plastic tasting cheap syrup. Don't get me wrong, I like it in small doses (eg. Funnel cake) but my crepes were oozing this sad excuse of pie filling. I felt sick and somehow powered through two of the three just to be nice.I noticed they had two awards hung up from 2006 and 2007. I can say th
3619;I just had a breakfast here.  The service was OK.  Food was OK (nothing to write home about, but acceptable).  They even served me hot tea with a glass of ice so  I could have an unsweetened iced tea.But I don't know how the others who commented on using the wifi were able to do so, unless it was for a short time. I had the waitress come over with the bill while I was still there,  I thought she was going off shift, but no.  Well,  I went and paid, and found out there was a limit on time.  As I was about to have a meeting online, I asked if I could stay long enough for that.As a side note, the restaurant was nearly empty (it was the whole time I was there), it was not like I was taking a table they could use for other customers, as they had almost none.  That does not come as  a surprise to me.The waitress said that would be OK, but then the manager came by, and it got really ugly.  He hover over me, and said I had to go, that they had a policy that people can only be there for 1.5 hours for a meal.
3620;This place smells of aged chip fat and should be avoided at all costs lest you be seen in it and have your credibility completely ruined.  It really needs a revamp. There are so many more attractive places to get breakfast, but it is open 24/7.  Eat here if you have finished washing windscreens at a Gardiner Expressway off-ramp or  pan handling on Yonge Street.
3621;Horible place we went with friends once and the whole experience was bad.Food is terrible and when we told this to the guy im charge he said: its fine if you not coming back we are busy enough.The place is old uggly. Go up one block and eat at Cora.
3622;Seriously I think I need to throw up and get this low grade slop they served to me out of my stomach. I feel bad for writing a bad review, at the same time this restaurant serves crap and I want to warn people and tell them their better off starving and eating breakfast when there are other hunger satisfying options.
3623;another place i would not go to again.took drink orderes wrong food was cold or wrong or late .took a long time to come out with beers and drinks or waters. was faster if you go up ur self and go right to the bar. i even had the bartender stop what she was doing, pick up the ringing phone at 11:30 at night and talk on the phone while there are people waiting to have there drinks.we as a large group ordered appetizers before our main food.wings, fries,machos things like that time passes and passes and passes and passes.  we never got our food then all the food comes out at once everything comes at once. appetizers and main food we sent back all the appetizers back to the kitchen. the main food was cold or given out incorrectly to the person. it was a huge mess, wait staff had a attitude problem, not going back again thats sure. this is another place that if they keep going like this they will die in business.
3624;Ok, two times and have to say the worst in The Beach.  Unreal service. Not a cool place.  Just saying.
3625;When I first new to the area, I came here thinking it'd be decent during the lunch hour.  How bad can simple noodles, tofu, and vegetables be?  As you can see from my rating, it was pretty bad.  I agree with the previous reviewer that this place is one of the WORST stores of the branding.  I've been to a few of them downtown Toronto near the Financial district and they were passable.  This place made me coin the phrase 'Terribly Yucki' for this place.The eating area is fairly big and pretty clean.  There was about half the tables filled with people eating so that's a good sign right?  There was no line up so I ordered and then became quite startled with what I saw.  I asked for the tofu and vegetables with udon noodles.  The udon noodles were so old they just landed onto the griddle in a brick.  The 'vegetables' consisted of a FEW shredded white cabbage and bean sprouts.  You know, the cheap free stuff they give you at the super cheap Vietnamese Pho places.  I looked up at the picture and there was tons of 
3626;I don`t know where to start..with the horrible customer service or the horrible food. My colleague and I decided to get some hot and spice chicken with some noodles for lunch. We were greeted with a very confused worker who we had to repeat our very simple ``Two hot and spicy chicken on noodles to go`` FOUR times to and still got the order wrong. Within the first few bites we could tell the chicken was off with both of our meals. Not only was the chicken under cooked but the taste was awful, it tasted like it had been sitting there for a while. We called them to tell them we are coming back to get a refund. Once we arrived, one of the ladies tastes the chicken we had gotten and thought it was fine and would not give us our money back. We had to reiterate several times that it was not thoroughly cooked and the taste was gag worthy. She went ahead and called the owner to figure out what to do. In the  mean time, another lady literally was in a screaming match with my colleague about how we would not get our mon
3627;No need to review this fast food chain in detail -- but it generally is one of the more healthier choices out there.  Unfortunately this location is *extremely* chincey on both the vegetables and the meat.  More so than any other location I've been to.
3628;Worst Harvey's I've ever been to. Ever. Went thru drive thru, placed our order, and then he tells us to pull ahead, no price given, didn't repeat the order back to us. There's a car waiting ahead of us at the window... 5 mins later we get to the window, guy says NOTHING... NOT EVEN 1 WORD TO US, and puts the debit machine in my face! I had to then ask him how much our food is, he tells me just a min, then closes the window on us then walks away. He comes back and tells us the price, again pushes the debit in my face, when I have to almost yell to get his attention, so he can read our order back to us, he starts reading, but it's wrong, so I interrupt him to get the order right, he prints out our order and hands us a little piece of paper, he then goes and gets someone else, who then comes to the window, and tries to word things as if we are "changing" our order at the window, so I interrupt him, and make him understand that we are not changing our order at the window, we are CORRECTING THEIR MISTAKE, and to s
3629;Ordered two of the new build-a-bowl's here.  The lady was being stingy and asked me for an original of the coupon (while there was no such thing as it is an online promotion, other locations don't even require a coupon).  Then when it came to the toppings she was trying to cheap out, giving me tiny portions and I had to remind her several times of the other toppings I had requested.I understand some location managers yell at their staff for giving too much toppings.  I guess this is one of them.
3630;This store/take out place is now out of business. I only went there a couple of times and it is seems too expensive for a combo - $8.99 and the sad part is that it's not that good. I think it is best to cook home made meals than go here.
3631;It's pretty rare to find a good filipino place to eat. Unfortunately this place isn't great. I've actually partially given up on filipino restaurants I'm just going to take advice from my mom and cook it all at home. I bought stew from this place and it's a stew my mom made religiously since I was younger. It had this grainy earthy taste to it. Honestly, there's no better way to describe it than the following... It tastes like they did not wash the meat thoroughly before cooking or cook it enough. On too of the fact that their food offerings looked pretty sad and not so vibrant. When I went in there they didnt exactly jump to the occasion of having a customer in store ready to give them money. They just acted like I interrupted them from watching their show in the tv hanging from he wall. I decided to buy a bottle of sauce as well and it was dusty. Like, filmy and dusty. Try don't take pride in their merchandise or food. This is so sad because they have such a great opportunity to make filipino food good bu
3632;I went to get some take out, I asked the "tindero (seller)" that I would like to buy a combo special but if possible he could separate the rice from the stewed meat. I do this because its "take out" and when I get back to my workplace I don't want my rice soggy from the sauce. The "tindero" refused because he said  that it was no longer a combo if it was separated. I offered to pay for an extra styrofoam container, the owner refused. I was rather disappointed and angry to be refused  for what I thought was a reasonable request. I never went back again also the food is not that good I go there because its the closest filipino joint to my workplace. The food is bland!!I do not recommend the food or the owners attitude to customers.
3633;Since they hired new morning staff, average wait time for a coffee is 20 minutes. Soo frustrating.
3634;This place has all day breakfast however at this time 3:50am they can't take orders cuz they are switching to breakfast??? Uhm ..all day!! That's what I want!! Bad
3635;This restaurant smells like piss and there's a crazy old guy with a black wig on in the back corner all the time who never orders anything but they won't kick him out.
3636;I've been there 2 times, the staffs are so rude. Never going back again. Awful services
3637;Quite possibly THE WORST McDonalds restaurant in all of Toronto. Too many people loitering, especially the creepy old man with a wig who smells like pee and never orders anything but is always seen loitering while reading several different newspapers. The restaurant very often smells like pee in the section by the washrooms. The place is always busy as hell, 24/7, and as usual, there is never more than 2 cashiers working, usually it is just one. The Drive-Thru is closed most of the time after 12am, even though there is supposed to be 24 hour service. Sometimes the inside of the store is closed (after 12am) because employees often skip their shift. One time they blocked the exits with trash cans (which is a Fire Hazard!) in order to keep new customers from entering the store because the shortage of employees. I once watched an employee throw a straw in the trash can and then take it back out and place it in a bag which was destined for the Drive-Thru. Disgusting! The sandwiches are horribly put together, a
3638;This McDonald's is the absolute worst in the area.Always crowded, with lineups up to at least 25 people. Never enough people working it seems. The long wait would be fine if the food was any good, but somehow they manage to make McDonald's food seem even worse than usual.And of course after you wait 15 minutes in line to get a McCafe drink, half the time you find out that McCafe machine isn't working (literally this thing is apparently broken every other day). The cashier employees are very polite, but the managers are usually pretty rude and unhelpful.Honestly, if you can help it, just take the 10 minute walk down to bloor street and go to the Tim Horton's at Gladstone and Bloor, or go to the dufferin mall McDonald's instead.You'll be much better off. Not only will the food be better, but you'll also be able to get a hot drink without wasting your time for 15 minutes! And it's probably faster to walk to the Tim Horton's anyway than the amount of time it takes to wait in line at this McDonald's for ba
3639;the clientele at this mcdonalds is out of hand. nothing against the employees who work here, it's the customers who smell. I just got back from eating here and can't get the stench of p*ss out of my nose. I had to stop eating half way through my meal because I was so repulsed from having to look at and smell the other customers.also, as one other reviewer mentioned there is a unsettling looking man who sits in the corner at a prime table 24/7 drinking coke out of a senior's coffee cup. he should be banned. mcdonald's doesn't need another ronald mcdonald creeping everyone out.
3640;As McDonald's goes the food is pretty standard. What makes this particular one rate only one star is the supremely bad service from the staff, particularly in the drive-thru. The service is always slow and sometimes the food is cold even though it is supposed to be "freshly prepared". I can't count the number of times they've screwed up my order. I have had many incidents of poor service there prior to this one but lets be realistic, nobody expects stellar service at McDonald's so I kept going back out of convenience. One time I was coming home from work late one night and decided to stop there for dinner because I didn't feel like cooking anything. I pulled up to the window to get my my order that totaled less than $5. I went to hand the drive-thru person a five dollar bill and she promptly refused to take it, declaring that it was counterfeit. She hadn't even touched it. She saw it in my hand and just stated that it was fake without even examining it. I worked in retail for a few years and know exactly how 
3641;I cannot even believe that I have gotten to a point of such frustration that I am now going to review a McDonald's but here I am. Cheeseburger with a Big Mac combo should not take 30 minutes to receive.  Further, when I do eventually receive it, everything should be the same temperature, hot or at a bare minimum, warm, however this Mcds seem particularly incapable of delivering this minimum requirement.  If you give me cold fries and ask me to wait 3 minutes for the next set of fries, then common sense  should prevail that the burgers I currently have will now be cold by the time I receive the new fries.   Please deliver the entire order, at the same temperature and at the same time. This is fast food. It is very apparent this is not the staff  on hands fault.  This is the owner of this McDonald thinking he/she can have a skeleton staff because there are electronic order terminals and now the poor woman/man forced to man the cash is also responsible for everything else - this does not work as is apparent 
3642;McDonald's is McDonald's, I've worked one and their made the same way. Service gets me and you know what. This doesn't even deserve a star. This is the closes McDonald to my bfs house so we come get food at night after drinking or going gone late. Most of the time it's always after 11. Which is when " overnight people start work" This mcds is so called 24/7 but for the last 6 or 7 times I've came either the drive thru is closed or the inside is closed. And this really pisses me off, I got I. One time just a bit after 11 and asked one of the crew members why it's always close at night and he replied that " no one shoes up for their shift cause no one wants to work overnight weekdays" sorry that doesn't cut it. Might as well be a god damn store that opens till 12 then closes for the rest of the night. Ridiculous, the boss of this store better get things straight on how to run a business because I'm getting very feed up coming here and it being closed. I'm very sick of seeing the " sorry we are closed for the 
3643;If I ever go here and they get my order right I'll be amazed.   Honestly I won't drive off without checking anymore because it is wrong more than half the time.  Ps they owe me $1.69 for a junior chicken that didn't make it in today.
3644;My wings were undercooked, tasteless and downright bland.  The burger was also bland.  The fries were meh (from the freezer).  They didn't really have anything special on tap either.I just returned from a trip overseas, had been craving some standard North American dishes, and I swear I had better from areas that barely knew what a burger was.They messed up my friend's food as well.  She had a wrap, and came out with two two-bite-sized soft tacos (with minimal fillings).  "Sorry, we ran out of wrap."  A little later, we noticed the table behind us ordered a wrap, and came as a wrap, and had at least quadruple the amount of filling.  We asked about it, and our waiter told us "Guess they found some?" and hurried away to another table.  They could of at the very least offered something to make up for it, or came back to inform her before making/serving it.The service was terrible, it took us almost 3 hours to dine there.  We were completely neglected the whole time by our waiter.  We had to hound him down 
3645;Worst place ever!! I've eaten at this place 3 times. The first time the chicken wings that I got were cold and I couldn't eat them. The 2nd time I found a hair in my rice and asked if I could just get my money back after being so disgusted they only gave me half my money back because they said that I are half even though I had only had one or 2 bites and the 3rd time was alright but it is also very pricey. If your looking for cheap go to bourbon or Caribbean queen much better!!!
3646;Being a food court restaurant the most important thing is for the food to taste good but the food here is so bland and tasteless. Not worth the money.
3647;Thick noodles here look like worms, all meat from here are tasteless, broccoli is barely even cooked. I was wondering what will break first, the broccoli florets or my plastic knife trying to cut them. Side note: these guys scream "End of Day $4.99 every 20 seconds, annoying the food court.
3648;food 3*, management 0*1.5 stars.I've had the pleasure of visiting more than my fare share of hospital cafeterias and this one is probably one of the worst ones so far. The only food option I would go for is the self serve Pizza, other food options don't really excite the taste buds. The hot food counter which usually offers either salmon, minuscule portions of fajita or some form of Indian food is quite overpriced. The swiss Chalet option is nothing you haven't experienced before, and during your time there you will realize they will try to do everything to charge you for anything! Getting a bagel?! The little packaged jams/PB will cost ~30-60c a piece! What really took the cake though was when they removed the water tap (the only working one in this area of the hospital) and suggested patrons either buy water or get it in the w/c!! That's just indecent.
3649;Went on Sunday and they said their location is discontinuing subs.  Yet the tv above showed subs.. at least turn the TV off so that no one thinks you're still selling it.
3650;Bland and dissappointing, got a chicken shawarma with lots of toppings and tahini and some olive oil based dressing. Waste of money
3651;This was probably the worst Demetres Dessert location l have been too in the last 5 five years it was deadly slow to seat us and was total chaos and total disorganized and  the waiter was awful at servicing us normally water is brought to the table first then normally drinks are ordered and brought to table the the desserts . But it was not like that at all last night the waiter kept going by us ignoring us at first and then when our drinks were brought there were aweful and not what they should of been !!!! We're very disappointed with last night and will not be returning to this location as with a brand name like your ever location should be exactly serving the same product quality and taste and here was nothing like l get at the brant st location which really serves top notched desserts l hope you take this review seriously and fix that location cause it make all your locations look bad .
3652;I'm horrified at the fact that they just don't care the for the visiting patron. Its upsetting that the staff has no ambition on providing the out most service,very disappointed! No strawberries, no whip cream on a Saturday night, why even open?
3653;The apple pie I ordered was definitely not worth the 14 or so dollars. Tasted like it was baked a week ago, refrigerated, then heated up in a microwave. The ice cream that came along with it was horrible. Demetre's ice cream is the worst I have ever tasted. It's so airy and full of fat, it tastes like sugary grease in your mouth. I want creamy ice cream, not buttery ice cream.Will not go again.
3654;Baaaaaadddd service: we had to wait 5 minutes to be seated in a half full restaurant. Finally when one of the two waitresses decided to notice us she was very nice and very polite. She pointed us to a corner of the cafe saying, "You can sit here this is our cleanest area." We waited another 10 mins before we ordered and i had to yell "excuse me" before she came by to take our order. But again when we were ordering she was polite. Last time i came here they gave us a table next to the restrooms in a half empty cafe. The foods great. So i guess i will just b going to another location next time.
3655;Slow and horrible service. Portions are way smaller then what they used to serve at other locations but the price is higher. Strawberries are cut so thin it's almost a joke that they count as a topping and even then you are lucky if you get more then 6 pieces. Not worth it.
3656;i used to bring my friend there, and i will no longer do so. Reason is that the service is so terrible. The waitress ignores us and it took a long time to get her attention. recently their price has gone up so much. a glass bottle of coke used to cost only $1 early last year, recently it went up to $3. Will never go again.
3657;Service was nice but slow. I had red velvet cake and Oreo icecream. The oreo icecream was horrible I asked her to take it off my plate. The red velvet cake was bland and tasteless. I ordered a diet coke and didn't even get a full cup. I got it in a vintage coke bottle that was only 237ml and paid 2.75 for that!  This place was good back in the day. I will no longer be going there.
3658;We got seated Sat night after waiting for 20 min at the door. Waiter brought us water and left us for 30 min. No menu, no serviceI flagged the waiter down and a gesture of wait a  minute was signalled to us.Unfortunately, no one followed up.We finally got up and left and went somewhere else for dessert.
3659;I had a terrible experience at Caffe Demetre last night. My girlfriend and I came in and waited for at the reception area for 10 minutes, without once being even acknowledged by one of the many employees walking past us. No one once said hello to us or told us how long the wait was. When a table cleared up, the manager cleared the table, wiped it clean, and then still avoided making any eye contact with us. A couple minutes later he rudely gestured for us to come sit down at a table next to the door. It was -8 degrees tonight, so naturally it was very chilly by the door, and my girlfriend and I waited for another table to clear up so we could ask to be switched over. Another 10 minutes go by while we wait at our table, and still no one has acknowledged our presence, let alone asked us what we'd like to order. Eventually we switch our tables and no one asks what we'd like to order. Frustrated, I waved down the manager and asked if we could order, and he says he'll tell a server to be right with us. Another 10 
3660;Overpriced.  Mediocre service.  Dry cakes.  The waffle and I've cream was decent though.  It's a place to go to when you need a dessert place when another isn't open or too far.
3661;So I went to Demetre yesterday in the very prestigious OOOOOAAKKVILLEEEEE and here's what happened. First off let me set the scene. I met up with my friends there and I had already eaten at Milestones (which was a wonderful experience) so I really couldn't eat anymore. My friends who were already there had ordered their deserts, drinks etc.. So the waitress comes along and here's what happened.Waitress: What can I get you to start?Me: I'll just have a water with lemon thanks.. I won't be having anything because I'm full. :)Waitress: Ok... But I'm going to have to charge you for the lemon. Me: Pardon me? You're going to charge me for the lemon??? *My friends and I both looked confused, some laughed and some just raised their eyebrows.*Waitress: Yeah.. I have too my manager is here.Me: Your manager SUCKS!!!.. Smh.Waitress: *Shrugs*SERIOUSLY???? WTF IS WRONG WITH COMPANIES HIRING BS MANAGERS ??? IS THIS A TREND?? OR IS THIS ONLY BECAUSE I'M IN OOOOOOAAAAAAKKKKKKKKVVVIIIIILLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
3662;They advertise that we can choose or build our own burger by order from the new kiosk. So we trying out but unfortunately is not . They already have set up menus. We ordered Mighty Angus . The taste same like other burger ... bland .
3663;Worst McDonalds I've been to. Some of the staff members are rude. They've gotten my order wrong plenty of times.One night, I pulled through the drive-through and nobody was answering to take my order. A pickup truck pulled up behind me and honked a few times before asking if anyone was answering to which I said "No". He advised me to go to the window, which I did. The lady was finally there ready to take an order so I told her "Hey, no one was responding so is it okay if I place my order here". She said I couldn't do that because there was a gentleman behind me and it would be unfair to make him wait. If I wanted to place an order, I'd have to drive all the way around to which I angrily did.Horrible service. If you live around the area, Mill Rd. in Etobicoke is 10x better.
3664;Cashier was rude and had attitude. We ordered bagel sandwiches for breakfast. Bagels were very dry and stale. We will never eat here again. How is this chain still in business?
3665;Service sucks. Food sucks my mc chicken has had been sitting over an hour it's as hard as a brick.Employees are really rude to the kids. Management sucks she told a customer to leave because he asked for ketchup packets which took a long time to find. Once customer received the ketchup all he said was you need to communicate with your staff.I would suggest for corporate to get involved.
3666;Lets start off by saying i hate writing reviews like this.  I walked into this McDonalds to grab a coffee and a muffin on the way to work.  Around 6:00 am this morning.  There was another gentleman there waiting for service, people walked by, put things in the deep fryer, did various tasks and not one of the several people including the drive through staff who saw us or the people cooking who saw us asked if we had been served.  I have to get moving, i have a long drive.  I cant wait.  The other gentlemen saw someone and tried to get their attention, still nobody came up even though he yelled hello to them.  I had to leave, this is no way to run a business, and sorry to say this is not the first time i have sat there as i hear them laugh and talk and see them walk by and ignore the customer.  The franchise owner needs to turn the staff and start over, so go to your security cameras and look.  The one between the cashregister and drive trhough area will show everything between 5:58 and 6:10AM this morning and 
3667;Goodluck if you want to do a drive thru. I ususally don't write a review for fast food restaurant but this location really pissed me off the drive-through is supposed to be a quick way of getting your food or whatever you want but I find that you could spend up to 20 to 30 minute in drive-through I timed it wants. I came to this location Couple of times thinking that maybe previously they were short staff perhaps..Unfortunately, everytime I have been there usually after 10 pm (no rush hour) drive through is just hell . Service is below average . If I only have an option to go to this location I would rather not eat at all . Where the hell is the manager??  who clearly isn't doing its job  by seeing how slow everything at this location runs. Hope it shuts down soon!
3668;I went threw the drive thru yesterday ( nov 24) at 2:30 in the afternoon. I ended up leaving without my order because the girl with no manners who was working at the cash window was so rude . She had black and red hair no hair net . Opened the window to tell me rudely I'm too close to the van infront of me. Who had tons of room to move up except decided to stay infront of window. I had to get going. I spent 13 minutes. I timed it.. Waiting to pay. Instead why don't you tell the guy to pull ahead a little bit. She then got another girl working to the window and pointed at me. I had my child crying from waiting so long and then left with nothing. She has no class and was extremely rude when saying I was too close. she repeated t a few times. I then called to speak to a manager and no answer . Tried three times. Way to run a business.  I know it's minimum wage but is it that hard to find people with manners who don't look like they just left the club and did the walk of shame into work
3669;Spent $50 on $20 worth of food. Battered chicken wings?!, dumplings were super mini and disgusting, chicken balls were all different sized (same batter as chicken wings), Egg rolls tasted frozen and then microwaved, wonton soup was terrible. I would have been better off going to the grocery store and buying a frozen chinese dinner. Ordered through justeat.ca where they had great reviews, but clearly the reviews were false.
3670;Worst spicy wings I ever had in my life. I should have read the reviews on Yelp first. I ordered Spicy wings and beef chop-suey. The beef chop- suey was ok but the wings were terrible. They were heavily battered and very greasy and most importantly lacked spice. The 'spice' was actually at the bottom of the serving container. We ordered from Just Eat. The driver and delivery time was fine, and the food arrived hot but was not great compared to other similar take-out places like Canton Chile, that have mastered 'Spicy Wings. Save your money and avoid this place...
3671;I got my food delivered through The Just Eat app. I got the Special Fried Rice, which was decent.  Also got shrimp spring rolls which were also not bad. We also got the Kung Pao Chicken.  It might have been one of the worst things I have ever eaten in my life. Kung Pao chicken is supposed to pack a punch flavor wise but theirs is dead. The chicken quality was terrible and there wasn't much of it. It was mostly just stir fried veggies. Stir fried veggies are not supposed to be in Kung Pao Chicken.  WTF?!?!
3672;While not an expert at running a food establishment , I can tell that serving customers a bunch of frozen vegetables is not a good idea. In addition to frozen veggies this store is famous for not washing their hands and using the same gloves after they take money. The manager doesn't seem to have a clue how to run her store and laughed when I told her how dangerous serving frozen vegetables and not washing hands was. No washroom at this location either. I hope subway head office catches them off guard and teaches them a lesson is cleanliness and customer service.
3673;worst food I've ever eaten! after 5 hours finished this, still want to throw out, cannot stop drinking water. Stay away from it!
3674;Run away - go anywhere else in the food court - DON'T EAT HERE -  If I could write the review with no stars it would still be too much acknowledgement. Ordered a dumpling and a shrimp & pork Har Gow - both undercooked and terrible - actually horrible  and  it's a food court so I felt it was okay that I spit everything into my napkin also had eggplant & noodles. It all tasted as if it was cooked in chemicals - HORRIBLE !!! I knew I should have ordered soup at the THAI place - thank goodness your in a food court with lots of optionsWill not be going back to Szechuan Express ever - HORRIBLE did I say that already ?? oh well it was worth saying it again so you will listen.
3675;Worst service ever! I didn't expect a decent service from here since it is just a Urban eatery, but the servers were really rude!! I got stared and rolling eyes from an old lady who worked there simply because I wanted to change my order from "eat in" to "take out"! The food does not worth the price. Worst quality I have ever had. Keep away from this place!!!!
3676;My Cantonese chow mien was terrible.  AVOID it at all costs!! When I got it, there was no seasoning at all.  The noodles barely touched the wok.  The "sauce" was liquid from the veggies, there was no cornstarch to make it shiny and slippery, there was no soya sauce, no pepper, no oyster sauce to make a cantonese chow mien sauce.  I sent it back and told them to keep their money but to tell their cook it's terrible and do something about it.I won't be coming back here.  It's fast food, but seriously, make it edible.
3677;In my first day in Toronto I wanted to get some good old Chinese fast food, but to my disappointment Szechuan Express had very cheap and bland food. I tried their wonton noodle soup and everything about it was bland and had no flavor. It tasted something they sell at a very low down buffet restaurant. The food they sell their was very similar to their noodle soups. Everything has pretty much no taste, hopefully other tourist will just go to a McDonalds instead of this.
3678;This store is totally disgusting. Display says 2items with noodle or rice is $9.99+TAX. and then I select 2 items and they charged me $13+TAX.  I thought I can choose from everything, and just picked up 2 but maybe they have some of exceptions(extra cost).  That's horrible, never happens in Thai restaurants that I can pick up 2 or 3 items like same style. Staffs are rude, they say something in Chinese I don't understand.  2 items meal doesn't worse $15, I don't  use here anymore.
3679;I was very disappointed yesterday because my experience with one of their other locations previously was GREAT.Service here was OK, but one of my meat selections was COLD, another was luke-warm, and the other was dry - too dry to eat around the edge of about 1/3 of the meat.I asked for their spiciest noodles.  They were pretty tasteless.I ended up taking part of the food home to give to my dog, and part of it I had to take home because the food needed to be HEATED UP in order to eat it.
3680;Their staff is extremely incompetent and rude to their customers. On February 2nd 2016, I reached their eaton centre location with some of my friends, just before closing time, and I saw that the dish labels were removed. Since we don't eat beef, we politely asked the lady if there were any chicken dishes still available, a simple question which she failed to understand. After repeating the question several times, she couldn't understand what I was saying.So we realized out that the lady at the food counter didn't speak fluent english, and we went over the cash counter to seek a simple answer to my simple question. But instead of helping us out, the cashier yelled back at us, telling us that it's not her job to tell us about dishes, and that we should look at the dishes and make out if there are any chicken dishes left. Now how the hell am I supposed to tell the difference between a cooked chicken or beef dish, just by looking at it? Plus, the whole point of having a customer service representative is to 
3681;Put all the bad service providers in one room ... ask them to serve and cook the most unhealthy meal, welcome to Szechuan Express where Chinese food is given a really bad name. Really bad. It's cheap so you get cheap service. But no one deserves a rude server. I ordered this honey chicken swimming in sugar and oil. They under charged me and because I did not want to start the new year with guilt, I told them about it. I requested for another cup of water on top of my paid drink and in mandarin, which I understand very little, said the other server: "this guy is annoying asking for two glasses of water."Really? Average order is $10, I spent over $20. After I rolled my eyes I went to my table and try to savour my food. Their last savior. My arteries were assaulted by honey chicken, so sweet it can pass as dessert. I ordered pork bun with a hair strand of pork. The rice is equally bad and hard as the hearts of servers.Stay away. Be healthy and sane.
3682;Really.  Eat one bite from an over cooked meal send it back and demand payment.   WORST place on Kingston  Road.   Would not take my worst Fenway here unreal.   Go to anywhere else.  This place sucks.
3683;Worst service. Sat ourselves, because that's how this place works. Waited 10 mins. Not one person that worked there said hello or even acknowledged us. As the server passed us 3 times and then stood at the bar looking around. We ended up leaving. This is not the first time this has happened. Been happening for a few years now. Manager is a joke. She has ignored us on numerous occasions as well. No wonder the employees don't give a shite. I'm not sure why I bother going back. The bartender with all the tattoo's is nice tho. And that's the only reason this place gets one star from me.
3684;Yikes, the place is disgusting!  I wonder how they pass  Dinesafe?I think I would prefer to eat in the back alley! Very trailer park!I will not be back!
3685;I have to downgrade Gabby's. After my last two visits I have to say the food should be avoided. Yesterday, of the three meals served to our table only one was edible. Coleslaw was brown and dry. Obviously days old.  I am surprised that the server allowed it to be served. The wings were hard and overcooked. We had a similar experience a few weeks ago.I am not waiting for the third strike...I won't be back.
3686;I'm pretty sure they're attending to make a name for themselves as the world's smallest wings. I also asked to put rugby on during the world cup and the server struggled for about 30 mins to get the correct channel. I literally told her the correct channel it was on like five times.
3687;Popped in when the Feathers was full, and found this place lack lustre. I didn't have high expectations, given it's a chain pub, but really it was cold, slow on service and the wine was probably the worst I've had since cheap uni-days wine. It was dead compared to the Feathers, and it was clear why. Improve the drink and food selection/prep, warm the place up and speed things up.
3688;I'm a major potty-mouth but I'm going to keep it clean for a fine website such as Yelp. Decor is whacky. Place is spacious. Lack of employees. Even the servers complain. Service takes way too long. Why I am here? I have no reason. Maybe it's something called Family Day. - Update: Confirmed. Owner is from China. The servers are complaining that they're 'worked to death'. Typical and shameful. - Second update: Reduced to a one-star rating because one dish did not come and they still added it to the bill. They did not get a tip. No offence to the employees who work there. To the owner...YOU SUCK - TOTALLY! (Trying so hard to refrain from curse words) - The people of this city...Oh heck...This country...Do not deserve your ways of operating a business. Total shame on you!
3689;上菜巨慢 特别咸 油大...口味也不好...上的菜基本是凉的 服务员也是找也找不来... we got here at 1:10 and waited until 2:00 before the waitresses even served us a single dish. Super slow service and food is very subpar. Also had to remind the waitresses that we were still existent
3690;I am so disappointed. We waited for almost an hour, and we made a reservation! The waitress only gives seat to people who speak Cantonese, and those people arrived after us and they don't have a reservation.  So we just left with really bad mood and starving. Never gonna come here again. The waitress also have a quite attitude.
3691;So. Terrible.1) Awful customer service - angry, inattentive, sloppy waitresses. They all had expressions on their faces that said, "Why am I working in this hell hole". No smiles were to be seen. 2) They have "VIP" pricing vs. regular pricing displayed blatantly on their menu - who wants to see that?? It's unprofessional. 3) We went for lunch at 12:30pm and they had NO fish, lobster, or other seafood available. Granted, this is when diners generally have dim sum but wouldn't you want at least the option?4) When we were seated and they gave us spoons, they literally threw the spoons into our bowls from shoulder level, chipping one of them!5) Food was mediocre at best. The environment was generally uneasy and uncomfortable. I have never eaten at a restaurant that made me feel like I wanted to leave immediately.
3692;It sucks, the service sucks, the food was meh and I'm never coming here againWe ordered a set meal so we had no idea what type of dishes to expect, the waitress gave us the wrong order and didn't realize until later then asked us to pay half of the wrong dish, even though it was their fault in the first place. She insulted us by taking the half eaten dish away , because she rather throw it in the trash. The place was very deserted during dinner hours, restaurant vibe was cheap, not only did the waitress try to argue with us she did not apologize for her actions.
3693;Bad service. Slow and disorganized in serving food. Servers don't clear dishes when you're done causing tables to be full one more food arrives. Two of my items actually never even arrived. We went up to the cash and that took about 10 more minutes just to cancel the two items. Dim sum is traditionally a very quick affair during a very busy serving time. However this place took forever to bring out each item even if they were very common dim sum items. When they arrived at your table the servers take forever to check the items off of your list.  Chinese restaurants are mostly known for gruff but efficient service. But the service here was gruff and really inefficient.They use some kind of system where they put receipts on top of the steamers so when the items arrive the receipts or slips of paper are really soggy on top of your cover of your food. The food itself was actually good but I would not stand another visit here because dim sum took twice as long. Beaware - don't bring any relatives from out of t
3694;Worst service I've had in years. The staff is rude. We were inexplicably denied switching tables to one of the numerous empty ones not in front of the gusty door area (it was so cold we had to eat with our winter coats on). How did they watch us eat in misery and not care at all. Food is mediocre but took a long time to arrive. Never cleared out empty dim sum plates, but instead just piled on new food on top of empty plates. Asked twice for a fork, and only got a plastic one both times. The reason was that they didn't have any clean ones left. Over the course of an hour, they couldn't wash one fork to give us. Would not recommend to anybody and definitely will not frequent again!
3695;Terrible experience. We were a group of 5 on Saturday night. Place was fairly busy, but not full. Ordered a steamed fish and three other simple, straightforward dishes. The steamed fish arrived 30 minutes after ordering, but It took us an hour from ordering to get the rest of our food -- and we still were missing one dish! We finished all of the food before that last dish arrived, so we sent it back out of pure frustration over how long it took.The food couldn't be more polarized. It was either bland or ridiculously salty, though the fish was decent. The supposedly healthy dishes were not palatable, while the marginally palatable dishes didn't seem to be healthy. I don't know what these guys are trying to accomplish. As far as service goes, it was pretty standard, and courteous as far as Chinese places go.They have some serious work to do in their kitchen. Too bad I won't be able to see their progress because I've vowed never to go back.
3696;Servers here were so rude! They put us at a corner table next to a huge crowd of diners and we were squished against them. We saw that there was another free table elsewhere so we asked them to switch but they refused because they said it was too busy (it was a Saturday but the table was free, so it shouldn't take that much effort on their part!). They even told us that we should be grateful to have a table at all! The food was okay but the service sucks!
3697;We decided to come here on a Wednesday night cause we wanted to avoid the weekend dinner crowd. As suspected, the place was quite empty and so we assumed service will be pretty fast...boy were we wrong. They served the first few dishes really quickly and then had a huge wait gap in between for the rest. Most of us lost our appetite waiting. We had to ask several times for the food until we finally got it. The food was at most mediocre and not even really "healthy". The real cream on top though was they HAD THE AUDACITY TO TELL US OUR TIP WAS NOT ENOUGH and we needed to leave more. I don't know what world they live in but TIPS are for good services AND UP TO CUSTOMERS DISCRETION. never coming back here again!
3698;Please do not waste your time and money here. After my previous experience (when I posted the tip during our 45-min wait for the food), my dad decided to give it another try because he reasoned, "maybe dim sum will be better^. The staff were rude once again, nothing changed there.. I had to wait for someone to take my filled dim sum sheet (even though the place was practically empty) and after 20 minutes of just waiting for our food, a server asks, "have you ordered your food yet?" ARE YOU SERIOUS?? We ended up getting up and walking out. This place does not know how to do business.
3699;Misleading advertisement. 1. They mention all dim sum $2.38 each, but actually it is only for member. 2. They have a daily special, but only after 10:00am. 3. The dim sum order paper is complicated, there are different price all over the paper.I won't go again
3700;Very bad service it took 35 min for the first item to arrive and this is dimsum. The dishes are dirty and poorly cleaned. The hostess gave our table to another group even though we were there first, she gives us a bs excuse saying they were a larger group but our table was the same size. They need to improve
3701;First of all the name of the restaurant is called Health Gourmet....there is nothing healthy about dim sum..So it's a weird name. ( So after reading others reviews, notice that they are trying to be a healthier dim sum place, less salt, less MSG and oil. But I still find the food lacks flavour.) The decor is also totally a mix mash of everything....warehouse ceiling and fancy chandeliers....the only good thing is the restaurant is very spacious. They are way under staff on Family Day...the dim sum itself is mediocre. Service is not that friendly either. Staff themselves are complaining they are overworked and under staff.  We arrived here at 9:45am or so. Order was punched in at 10:19am...we are still here at 11:15am and still waiting for the rest of our order. We decided to leave and didn't want to wait for our last order of Haw Gao. But they charged us for the dish that didn't arrived. We decided to just not pay tips and leave. Even though they had service button at each table. No one comes when the bu
3702;This place is spacious, lots of seating. Decor doesn't really make sense with fancy chandeliers and bright green chairs but that's not the worst thing about this place. Came here for dim sum and the service was so painfully slow. Not enough servers and the employees they do have dont have a clue about anything. Dishes that we ordered two of only came out in singles. Food was mediocre at best. Rice rolls were the best thing that came out (when they eventually came out). We ended up leaving and asked for the dishes that never made it to our table to be removed from the bill. This was a painstakingly long procedure even though it was just two items. This place is just really disorganized. There's this VIP card program which you can buy and allows you a 10% discount off the food for a year. Even with this discount, it's not worth it.You know this place is bad when a worker here serves you your food and asks you why you're even eating here when there are better restaurants nearby with similar pricing and bette
3703;Do not come here. This place is ghetto and the food quality is very low. Cleanliness is low, even for chinese restaurant standards. HARD PASS.
3704;0 star. I would go lower than that if I could. Worst dining experience ever in Toronto. Bought a 45 dollar value coupon of dinner for two. One of the three dishes came with ONLY four thin slices (size of small Doritos chips) of eggplant on a iron plate which was not even heated. Never going back.
3705;The food is decent enough for my family to come back about 4 times when other restaurants are full. All four times we came they're always out of stock on something. Today, they were out of chicken and told us to choose another dish from the menu. Countless of selections later due to many items being out of stock, we ended up getting cheaper dishes.. I don't understand how as a business you can run out of items on a holiday. Do they not expect the amount of people coming in for holidays? I do not recommend, please stay away. The place is not very healthy gourmet at all.
3706;AWFUL service at this location. First my order was processed as pick up instead of delivery, then when I called the dispatchers back, they took down my address wrong. I finally get a call from a delivery driver, who barely speaks English and cannot understand the directions to get to my unit. Each time I spoke to him on the phone he was rude and hung up on me. After 10 minutes of walking up and down my street looking for him I finally understand that he has been sent to the wrong address. I waited a little longer then called the restaurant location to talk to them and see if they could help me. Everyone I spoke to on the phone was extremely unhelpful to the point of incompetence. The driver finally reached my building and refused to come to my unit door, so I had to go meet him. I paid for delivery then practically picked up my order. The driver had the nerve to ask "Any tips?". By the time we got our order the pizza was cold and soggy and we had waited an hour.
3707;The worst Pizza Hut place, even the worst pizza place I've ever been. Terrible service, rude staff and horrible baking too. I went there a few times since it's close by. They see you but no one cares until you wait at least 5 minutes! The last time I got my pizza it was half burnt and 3 slices of it had no topping on it!
3708;The worst pizza hut franchise. Ordered pizza two hours back, haven't got it delivered. No one picks up the phone at the given number and when I called at pizza hut customer care, first I had to wait for 20 mins n then the lady who picked up the phone said she can't help as it is an online order. I can't imagine such a big company has such a pathetic customer service and such horrible franchise.
3709;Terrible.We ordered a large pizza, and wings for delivery.  The estimated delivery time was 45 minutes according to my online order.  Living in Liberty Village, I didn't think it would take that long as I could have walked to the store and back in 30 minutes.  It took almost 60 minutes to arrive!  I thought I'd give the delivery guy the benefit of the doubt, it was Saturday night at dinner time.  However, I asked him if they were busy, expecting him to say yes.  His answer...'No, not really'.To make a bad experience worse, the food was bordering on cold.  There are way too many pizza places to bother with this Pizza Hut.  Bad, slow, cold service!
3710;The worst Pizza Hut I've ever experienced. The worst pizza joint I've ever experienced. The worst restaurant I've ever experienced. They are Soooooooo slow. Delivery times are regularity 1.5-2 hours....for pizza!!! Staff are rude. Pizza is almost always cold, undercooked, or really low on toppings....or usually all of the above. And they NEVER answer the phone!!!!
3711;Wow, this place is horrible!!!I placed an online order for pickup and took advantage of their wings promotion as I was craving wings and didn't have time to either make my own or go to my favorite wing places.I arrived at the location 5 minutes after of my estimated carryout time and the counter was very busy, understandably it was dinner time on a long weekend. However, even with two people working the cash only one was seemed to be serving pickup orders and she was taking way too long chatting with a relative who was there to pickup an order. The food was extremely disappointing. I ordered a side Caesar salad, a regular order of garlic bread with cheese and 8 wings and it came to $15.57. While normally this is a reasonable price but it did not taste very good, the portions of the garlic bread and salad were small and the Caesar dressing packet was warm which I didn't attempt to use as the packet said to keep refrigerated, which I also question the safe storage of the salad which I noticed that my entir
3712;They allow customers to smoke inside the restaurant. So no matter how the food taste, I won't come again and I won't recommend it to anybody (unless you are a smoker and would like to smoke indoor).
3713;This is the sister restaurant of Top 1 in Richmond Hill. I have to give them credit in how they renovated the previous restaurant into something that is clean and upscale. But is that alone enough to bring in business? How about 10% off? Not really, as I doubt I would be back.Soup was a not a good start as the menu described as traditional soup of the day but we got a funky snow pea sprout with corn starchy soup.The main were not bad as the beef tenderloin though over sauced but tender but with no honey black pepper flavour. Lobster and fried rice were ok but be careful of sand inside the veggie.Dessert was one of the worst red bean soup I ever had.  A watery soupy mess.Service though is friendly but even the waitress realizes how bad was the dessert, I think there is an issue.Will be a pass.. $48 for a set dinner for 2? There are way better options in Scarborough than here.
3714;Although the new decor is nice, I honestly rather have the old restaurant back. Portions are small and pricey, and they take forever to come. Worst of all I couldn't even enjoy the new decor as my family and I got placed in the dingy basement. How unfortunate.
3715;They make pretty good shawarma.However, their customer service is terrible and requires a lot of improvement. Especially because of one lady who is always unhappy and rude towards customers. I am an occasional customer, but the attitude at that place makes me go to other places to get lunch.
3716;One star for failing to deliver an authentic shawarma.My so called shawarma turned out more so like a wrap that I could probably find at any pita shop. I wanted mine to have succulent meats and veggies. Unfortunately this place falied to provide. There are MANY shawarma places in Toronto however, this isn't one of them IMHO. You can find much better for more reasonable prices and great shawarma taste. My hunt for my next shawarma continues!
3717;COCKROACHES!! FOR YOUR OWN HEALTH DO NOT EAT HERE!!I came to this place on the second floor of Pacific Mall. Clearly the people running the store do not care what is in their food. I ordered their tenderous ribs ramen. Halfway through the bowl a boiled cockroach floated up to the surface. I brought the bowl back to the lady at the counter,  explained and showed her that there was a cockroack in my ramen. She was not surprised, gave no comment and had no reaction... and then proceeds to ask, what's wrong with it, as if everything is ok. I explained to her that cockroaches can be very dirty and there is a cockroach in my bowl and that it is NOT OK to serve food like this. She then asked ME to take the bowl to the middle foodcourt garbage can and throw it out. She couldn't be bothered lift a finger, not even to handle the bowl of ramen herself but worst of all, NOT EVEN TO TELL THE KITCHEN that was right behind her to double check their food. Not once did she apologize.In the end, she did give me a refun
3718;4 days later, and I'm still trying to figure out what piece of the chicken I was eating. I had already had my ramen fix the night before, and opted to get the chicken curry which was presented nicely... the taste was just...yeeeeeeuuuuck. It definitely tasted like Glico's mild curry mix, but it was just super lack lustre and made me aware that the presentation was intended to compensate for the deplorable cooking. The chicken was...gummy, if you can believe it. It was served with what I *think* was supposed to be miso soup but was clear with seaweed and tasted like boiled fish bones. No miso taste in sight to balance out the complexity of a proper dashi stock: it definitely wasn't made from katsuobushi. My boyfriend got the tonkotsu ramen which was even more appalling. Lifeless noodles with no bounce to them, and pork that looked like it had been cooked 5 days ago. Do not be suckered in by the friendly girl at the counter shoving (I mean that politely) a menu in your face.
3719;So I ordered 2 happy meals but they forgot the chicken nuggets! Like how the hell do you forget the main ingredient?? I had to drive back all the way again to McDonald's
3720;Restaurant very dirty garbage everywhere.  Employees very slow food is not hot even though we sent back original fries and asked for fresh fries.
3721;I wanted to order a poutine. Slavika the woman at register was so rude to me. "What do you want, huh?" Was how she welcomed me to mcdonalds. Her behaviour is disgusting she should not be working at this place
3722;Worst Pizza Hut of all time. Patrons beware. This is unfortunately the closest one to our house and ever since Pizza Hut launched their online $10/Pizza of the day, we began ordering more Pizza Hut the  ever before in life. Unfortunately, there are a slew of issues with this location and not once but a handful of times now, we have not received our orders. It's always one pathetic excuse after another. Staff explanations always end up reflecting something that is ultimately not the customers problem. And whenever they mess up, their only resolution is to offer 20% off your order. Last time, an hour after we ordered online, 15 minutes past expected delivery time, no pizza. They blamed an online ordering glitch (not my problem), and said that our pizzas actually hadn't been made yet because no driver was available (again, not my problem). FYI, your Pizza isn't prepared for delivery til a driver shows up at the store. How do you market and actively offer delivery as a feature, yet, the system is so faulty? It's 
3723;Awfully undercooked pizza. Worst fries ever. Stale garlic bread. Never again ordering from here
3724;Don't bother asking for what the specials are because the women's going to tell you "whatever is in the flyer". After I got that response, I left and went next door to Pizzaiolo. It's no wonder that place is always empty. Keep up the bad work and hopefully a better business will take over.
3725;Ordered daily special. More than half the pizza was the crust. The owner must be really cheap. Avoid this place at all costs!
3726;Super skimpy on toppings. We ordered three stuffed crust pizzas. A large hawaiian that came with maybe five of the smallest pieces of ham (basically was a pineapple pizza). Also ordered a large canadian and a large supreme which both barely had any meat on them. So tasted like a plain cheese pizza and a plain cheese with green peppers pizza instead of what they should have been.Total was $90, for the size and skimpyness of the three large pizzas and 2 tiny garlic breads ($6 before cheese add-on), wasnt worth it at all.But nice delivery guy and it also took less time than the estimate given.
3727;I ordered my pizza at 9:01. Get an email saying it would arrive at 9:56 but I no Pizza Hut takes a while to deliver. At 10:00 I hadn't heard anything yet. At 10:10 when no one had contacted me I decided to call the store. I called 4 times and got no answer so I gave up on that. At 10:19 my pizza showed up. I got a stuffed crust pizza and some garlic bread with cheese and it was TERRIBLE. Of course I could have guessed that would happen since I order it 1 hour and 20 minutes prior. I got an email to fill out a survey but it won't let me fill it out since I wasn't given an actual receipt. Worst pizza I have ever gotten. Likely will not order from there again which sucks cuz I love stuffed crust.
3728;Yup, this location still deeply sucks!Would you please go out of business already so I can get delivery from another location where they actually give a crap and put the slightest bit of effort into making a pizza?Please everyone, do NOT order or buy anything from this store so they can finally close down and not to be the store that we are forced to get delivery from at Yonge and Sheppard!There's another one right up the street that is much much better, go there instead.
3729;Horrible customer service. I would give 0 stars if the application allows for it, avoid this place at all costs, many other pizza joints literally down the road, pizzaiollo and pizza pizza, along others, with way better  customer service and food.
3730;This place is actually terrible. They have so many toppings to hide the fact that their falafels taste like shit. I am eating leftovers from earlier because Loblaws is closed, I have no food at home, and am a masochist. My falafel (possibly the worst falafel I have ever had in my entire life, and that's saying something) also cost me $7.50, which is almost twice the cost of a falafel anywhere else (ie Ali Baba's, which even has two for one falafel deals! crazay!). I have always seen the people working here look sad that the places beside them got way more business, and I always felt a little sad for them, but no longer. The product is absolutely terrible, they probably have no repeat customers. Service was not very friendly either (eesh dude it wouldn't kill ya to smile would it?), but honestly what I can't get past is the combination of expensive and disgusting. Avoid this place, go to Karine's next door. They're way cheaper and it's actually fucking amazing!
3731;Wow. Did the woman actually just pretend to give us an extra quarter slice of tomato? Yes, yes she did. Never have I met another shawarma restaurant owner who was so stingy. And never have I had shawarma that was not freshly shaved off. I should have known there was a catch to being able to have chicken AND beef in one pita!!I know cravings are powerful, folks, but just please don't give into pita village.
3732;My friend decided to treat me to McDonald's on Sunday April 14 @ 2AM. Things went downhill the moment we went in. First, the cashier punched in the wrong order Second, the meals were served cold Third, we were charged incorrectly and Forth, the food made me sick. I can say this: I am never going back, my worst experience at McDonald's, ever!
3733;Food was awful service was slow!  It took forever to get our food.  Never mind the cold pasta I ordered which I sent back and wait 20 mins for a new plate. Won't be back here again!
3734;Worst Boston pizza experience I've ever had. 4/5 dishes we ordered were cold. Service was less than friendly, also cold and short.  Kind of unusual as the place was not busy in the least. When we mentioned to the manager about our issues instead of fixing the problems we had he decided that the best he could do was discount our bill by 25%. Next time we will take our money to a fast food location, where staff is pleasant and they serve their menu items as described and at the appropriate temperature. Step it up BP you're killing your reputation.
3735;Most disappointing visit here and imagine I hadn't even eaten any food. It's a Saturday night and just wanted to watch the soccer game and eat some pasta. But ended up walking out. First off the hostess did not even greet me, secondly I walked into the bar area and sat down, there were three servers in the bar area and not one even acknowledged me. I waited 5 mins to see if anyone would come and greet me. No one came so I walked out. End of story. I expect more from a Canadian establishment. I ended up going to Buffalo Wild Wings and was greeted by the hostess who asked how I was doing. The place was busy, more than I can say for Boston Pizza. Not coming here again.
3736;Worst service ever. Been to other BP and other establishments in the area, we've actually been to the Vaughan BP 4 or 5 time and the service has been bad every time! The last time we went we were seated quickly but no one came to our table for atleast  12 mins to take our drink orders, and man I was thirsty that night. Funny thing is the restaurant wasn't even busy. I won't go back and neither should you.
3737;Terrible customer service....2nd bad experiences...won't be going back.1st experience: sitting bar side and waited over 15 minutes for drink refill. No serving staff visible for around 15 minutes called the restaurant from my cell and asked for service.2nd bad experience....bar side again. Sat for 10 minutes before getting menus...was not asked if we wanted drinks...waitress dropped menus and ran. 15 minutes in and newly seated people were sipping drinks. A second table that came in after us put in their food order after receiving drinks. After 25 minutes, serving staff rushing past, managers walking by got up and told this same story to the manager now behind the bar....told him we are leaving. Walked next door to Montana's...pleased with their services.TERRIBLE SERVICE at Rutherford & 400 Boston Pizza...we were ignored in general. This location needs a refresher course in customer service.
3738;Got very sick with poisoning in food calamari was undercooked, every time I get perogi pizza on naan I get very sick and barf in Camry not good experience with this location sick for many days with family
3739;Positive: server was quick and nice. Negative: everything else Apps platter was oily and salty. My entree: chocked jambalaya pasta disgusting !!! Eeww. Desert was pathetic. Senseless tasteless food. The place was nearly empty for a Friday night. Even my coke was tasteless and flat. There is no quality on the food. I normally would never go toBoston pizza but I'm forced  to go when someone is having a gathering or something. Also the manager cameOut to checkOn his guests. This is always a good technique and shows excellent customer care. Once again service was great but they need to change up recipes for a more yummy experience. They also gave my nephew crayons, another satisfying experience by the staff!!   Boston pizza is only good for group events wanting to watch a sports gameOn their large screens. Bp, please reinvent your menu
3740;Called in for a delivery order. One small pizza and a side. Was told 40-45min delivery. Order came one hour 15 min later. My small pizza was cold and rock solid. After all this wait! This is terrible service. If you can't do delivery right, dont do delivery. Why are you delivering cold food that is late and looks stale?Paid $35 for a tiny pizza and a small side. What a rip off! Go away Boston Pizza. You are broken. Should've just ordered PizzaPizza.
3741;Very bad. Worst subway I've been too. The people who work there are even worst then  greasy subs they make
3742;We ordered lunch from Amato's yesterday and the Delivery was in decent time about 40 min. I ordered 3 mushroom soups at 4.95 each. They were like eating warm buttery watered down milk with mushrooms with really no taste but butter.Also ordered a Chicken Pollo Parmigiana Sandwich, 2 slices of pizza doe. Very hard, tough to chew and dry. the chicken wasn't bad for sure not the best.All in all a very disappointing product to serve. Would not order from here again since this food was an F on my food scale.What a waste of money.
3743;If I could give 0 stars I would. Terrible, terrible, service! I ordered a pizza with their convenient online order for a birthday dinner. I received an order confirmation at 6:44 pm, by 8:00 nothing, even though I was promised deliver by 7:40. When I called, no one knew what I was talking about and they were less than helpful. I suggested that maybe there was a problem with their online order service, the guy just said "yeah, maybe". I suggested he get rid of the online service from the website if it did not work. He said "okay". If I didn't know any better I'd say the guy had no idea what was talking about.  Like I said terrible service. And the pizza looked like it would be so good! The owners need to get a clue.
3744;The renovations they've done here are great but honestly they need to add some flavor to their food. I just don't have anything positive to say about it. It's a good spot to come for a drink though and watch the game. They've also got a patio as well but not much of a view.
3745;Worst customer service on the bar side. Unfortunately I didn't get her name but she was the worst server. This waitress called my friend names and swore only because he threw up. Disgusting. Never are we returning to this location again. Told my family and friends as well, sucks because we live in the neighbourhood and were regulars.
3746;Was great when it first opened, then portions kept getting smaller, prices kept going up, and there were less and less staff, now I avoid this place, the prices are too high for the tiny plates they have.I should have realized how good it was when it first opened.
3747;After eating here I came down with ecoli poisoning. They did not cook the chicken through and both my friend and I were sick for weeks.
3748;If you have somewhere to be afterwards or on your lunch break, don't come here. Service is SLOW. We came here because it was convenient. After work around 6pm. 5 tables full, 3 servers on the floor and yet it took 15 minutes for someone to take our order we were ready to order after 2-3 minutes. It was maddening. But the servers were nice, so that's one redeeming quality of this restaurant. Their spinach and artichoke dip wasn't as good as I've tasted in other restaurants. Not enough pizza bread comes with the dip and they DROWN it in parmesan. The parmesan was all I tasted.  We also ordered the club sandwich. The chicken had no seasoning at all, it tasted boiled. When we told the server, she said it was grilled in the oven and they don't season it for a reason. Why serve sandwiches with unseasoned, bland chicken that tastes boiled? Who knows.I get pizza is their specialty but why have crappy food on the menu? If pizza is all they can make right then just serve pizza and no sides. They clearly can't ma
3749;Went out for beers and wings.Pitcher had a plastic insert in the middle and was told it has ice to chill the beer. We felt it's a clever way to rip you off. Please refer to the picture. We barely got three glasses out of a pitcher.
3750;We come here often. Always sit bar side. Just two of us. No problem. This time was different. I bought my son and 2 grand kids. First. No offer of a booster seat. Went and got my own. Second. Was told by waitress that she would not return until we all closed our menu so she didn't have to waste time returning if we didn't know what we wanted. What if we had a question?  Third. She didn't write our order down ( because she's so smart). Then other staff had to return and ask what we ordered. A person ( not our server) bought my son and my food first. We order sandwiches. His fries were hot, mine stone cold.   Then we waited and waited. Next they bought over my hubby's wing. Still no sign of very small children's spaghetti.  When they finally did get their food there was no apology so I assume they think this was fine.  Must point out that other tables were getting food while we waited. I went and found the parmigiana cheese myself at the waiter station. After we finished eating I realized we were not 
3751;This has to be the worst Boston Pizza I've ever been to. Service here is abysmal. On my first occasion, hostess was not very welcoming. There was no "hi, how are you?" or "welcome", almost like a what do you want attitude. She proceeded to take us to the bar section and had informed us that there weren't any avaliable seats in the dinning room. Unfortunately, I didn't hear this part. There was a game on and a lot of people talking in the bar. Since I didn't hear her, I asked the hostess if there was any room in the dinning room. She responded in an extremely negative manner, rolling her eyes. Something you don't expect from a hostess. I was turned off by the whole situation and decided to just leave without ordering anything. Went to the Kelsey across the street instead. We came back again on another occasion. The place is the right across from my house and figured the first occasion was a one off. Really wasn't. Another hostess greeted us with better manners, however we had to wait almost 15 minutes for 
3752;One of the worst lunch experiences of my life. The "box" lunches are absolutely horrendous. Ingredients are NOT fresh, particularly the steak and the falafel. And they are filled 80% with white basmati rice. I wouldn't eat there again, even if it was offered for free. Complete waste of money. Also, ew.
3753;I would give this 0 stars if I could. Foolish me wanted a Caesar salad and I quickly ordered one from here. Shredded iceberg lettuce, 1 slab of "bacon", a sprinkle of powered parm and some crispy croutons (only redeeming thing) - that was my salad. Rookie mistake to order from here, will not be coming back again. Worst 6$ spent.
3754;If you're looking for a place to get a good salad, just keep walking past this place. I was in a hurry and wanted a chicken caesar salad so i stopped at this Fit for Life.  Asked for the salad and no croutons.  They made my salad i paid and was handed what looked like a child size salad for 9 bucks. The container is about the size of my hand.  HUGE RIP OFF.  Go to the grocery store and buy the salad bowl instead. The dressing was terrible and the serving of chicken tiny for the 3.00 add on.  They also use sub shredded lettuce. FAIL
3755;Horrid location, and owner with attitude. Service was sub par as mentioned by others. We definitely wont be coming back to this location. If anyone deserves to go through financial straint, its this owner. I can't believe her arguing with customers on the floor (multiple ones too). Definitely doesnt know anything about customer service!
3756;Poor service.  We finished our drinks and waiting over an hour before being served.  She spoke with her Chinese friends and served them before us.  Confronted service staff and they shouted at us.  Very poor service.  Do not recommend.
3757;I ordered a hot dog. They gave me a wrap with sausage. This wrap dog has everthing a normal person won't put on their hotdogs.  Like huge pieces of uncut lettuce. Along with cheddar that tasted old.Seriously how hard is it to make a hot dog? And who eats hotdogs with a wrap?I ordered a taco last time which was really awful too.Advice: don't order anything other than wings from here.cuz u know they will mess it up
3758;Waited 30 mins and never got served. I only recommend coming here if you don't want to eat!
3759;Here on a Saturday and had the classic wild chicken crunch. The chicken was over cooked and so dry. The fries were gross. And the gravy was so runny and unfavorable. I've been to other wild wings and they were good. Very disappointed.
3760;Ordered food for 6 people. Called ahead of time for pickup and was told it would be 25 mins. I arrived 30 mins later. Paid for the food, and waited another 30 mins for the food to come out!!! Only after I asked for a refund to go elsewhere did I get the food. We were in the car getting ready to come home when an employee came out to give us something they forgot. When I got home, I found my burger was not what I ordered. I just ate it anyway. I am not at all impressed with this restaurant, it's service, it's staff or the quality of the food. While I was as waiting for the food, the bartender and one other employee just kept looking over at me sheepishly. Thank god I had a friend with me to pass the time or I might not have been so patient. The restaurant had 3 tables full, and 2 single patrons at the bar. No excuse if you ask me.
3761;Why does my local wild wing location suck so much ? I think the owners are completely useless , I think they would be better off if they stayed at home & hired a "real" manager to run the floor of their restaurant .. the servers are lacking energy .. Customer service is brutal , maybe you'll get lucky & get a better waitress , but then again they are pretty bad , they tend to say oops I forgot to put your order in while they all congregate at the bar milking their hourly wage while ignoring you because your order hasn't come in nearly 45 mins !! And then there's the food .. So it finally comes .. and was it worth the wait?? .. the wings , you better not mess up the wings .. Fortunately .. It was acceptable .. But .. We ordered a big variety of items as well , all the hot dogs ( don't waste your money , better going to get street meat dt for 3 dollars and loading it up yourself ) Calamari is a near pass perhaps ... The fries and chilli was the most disappointing thang.. Your better off eating Taco Be
3762;My friends and I went to this specific location to watch a non main event UFC match, some just wanted to come and hang out, and got a horrible experience in return. 15 minutes into the event, we were told that we each had to spend a minimum amount of $20 each in order for us to stay during the event. Some of us already ordered our beers and food, but he wasn't willing to wave this policy for our group.We had a chat with the boss and asked if this was a Wild Wings policy or just a policy for that specific franchise. It turns out it was only for that franchise and it ruined a great get together among friends. We won't be going back there just because of this mishap.
3763;Well, unfortunately I have to decrease my original rating BIG TIME for this place. Went in for a beer around 5 o'clock yesterday while I was waiting for a Dominos pizza. I wish I hadn't. Atmosphere was completely shot...just an overall dull on-your-deathbed kind of feeling in the air...Bartender greeted me first before the waitress/hostess (i don't know if the waitress was shy but the whole time she was usually somewhere in the back). Didn't really like the snooty/lazy service already...'bartendress' behaving as if I'm some sort of dumb-a$$ for not knowing all the brands of domestic beer...maybe i am but I wouldn't expect a tip if you feel so inclined to talk down to me! I still went ahead and ordered a Budweiser. Bartender told me to sit down and the waitress would bring me a bottle. Decided to sit out on the patio to grab some sun and the waitress was smiley & friendly & served me my bottle...she was also kind enough to let me know that the bar rail was the same price as the domestic beer. Then I remember
3764;This review is directed at the Hoops Sports Bar and Grill location that issituated on 4207 Keele Street (opposite of the York University Keele StreetCampus): On January 5th 2012, I was at this location with a research colleagueof mine at approximately 8:45pm. Being Graduate Students on a fullscholarships, we were at this establishment to celebrate new job prospects, animminent graduation, and possible entrance into law school and a PhD program,respectively. Myself and my colleague are not the belligerent typology of barfrequenting clientele- on the contrary, we are highly respectful individuals,well educated, and we tend to tip fairly well in relation to the service andtreatment gained through each experience associated with a casual night out.Now that the context has been laid, I will jump right into the disastrous eventthat unfolded. Upon entering the establishment, we ordered 1 (one) pitcher ofHeineken, 1lb of peppercorn wings + fries, and another 1lb of honey garlicwings+ fries. We receive
3765;As the saying goes: "First impressions last a lifetime".My first impression of this place was terrible. B!tchiest waitress I've ever had in my life. SHE THREW THE MENUS AT US! Drank our water and left before even ordering. I will not go back to this place. Ever.
3766;Yuck!  Let's see... the only way to describe this place is: dirty, over-priced and bland!  Save yourself and go two doors down to Quiznos if you need a quick bite, I wish we did.  Won't be going back... ever!
3767;I came here on a Thursday night with a friend that I hadn't seen in a while, hoping to catch up with him.  There was a big hockey game on (IIHF junior gold medal game), so I was hoping to catch that too.  This is a sports bar, right?  I figured it was a safe bet that it would be showing.We got to the bar, sat down, and ordered a couple of drinks.  The hockey game was showing, but the sound was drowned out by the music they were playing.  That was pretty disappointing, but I was happy that they were at least showing it.  Then the DJ (*sidenote: why is there even a DJ at a sports bar..?  Where there isn't even a dance floor..?) decided to crank the music.  When I say crank, I mean that my friend and I had to yell at each other to be heard - it was ridiculous.  I flagged down our waitress and asked if she'd mind asking the DJ to turn it down a few notches there were other patrons who were visibly annoyed by it as well.  She gave me an apologetic look and said that the same thing happens every week: people comp
3768;For chains such as these I've come to believe it's best to stay with tried and true classics such as burgers and fried foods (I mean, there's much less to mess up here...). Pasta? ...please. Just pour yourself a pitcher of vegetable oil and down that instead. At least their Double Chocolate Mousse CheeseCake was pretty good. Decorative as well (to my surprise)!
3769;Hoops is a chained restaurant? How?Let me get this in the open right now if you are a civilized person, do not come here. If you're looking for a place to subside your hunger, do not come here.If lack the physical ability to defend yourself, do not come here.And if you are a York University student looking for some late night grub, don't have a car and this was the only place open, still..do not come here!I have been here on several occasions, none of which were voluntary, and all of them during the late hours. I like to call it: 'The Hoops of York'You will never have trouble finding parking here as the enormous lot caters exclusively to its patrons at night with every other store closed. This run-on sentence concludes everything good I have to say about Hoops.Upon entrance, you are met by baseball caps, size XXL collared shirts on medium sized people, medium Tapout shirts on XXL people, students who should be studying at the Library at York instead, and clusters of Abercrombie & Fitch catalogue re
3770;This place is mostly empty. I wonder if its the manager's attitude that keeps the place empty!! Lol.They have no understanding of customer service. Wondering how long can they survive :)
3771;This has to be the slowest, least customer centric Thai Express I've ever been to. The cashier and the cook clearly didn't want to be there. They seem so depressed. The cashier wasn't exactly friendly either. "What do you want?... You're paying debit...". Very unenthusiastically. We waited more than 10 minutes from our food, which was sloppily put into a box and given to us. No "thank you", no "please come again".... What a depressing hole. I won't be back here anytime soon. Don't bother coming here. Might as well go to McDonalds. At least people are more friendly there.
3772;If I could give 0 stars, I would. I am shocked and appalled at the terrible service that I received at this location. I tried to redeem for the free sub from the app offer, and was told to buy one to get the offer. The app couldn't pull up the offer code due to some glitch, so I purchased 1 sub and left only to find that it had NO toppings and was burnt black.
3773;I've been to this location 2 times, both times have sucked.The first time, like the others who have posted, I wasn't given the chance to add lettuce or anything else that wasn't apart of the "recipe".So on my 2nd visit I made sure when I ordered my Baja sandwich to specify that I wanted lettuce and tomato added. When the sandwich made it to the cash, it wasn't what I ordered at all. The Baja is a chicken sandwich, this was a beef sandwich. When I said something he shrugged and went to set it aside... But since there was a big line up and he was the only person working, I said I'd take it and try it anyways.You'd think when you completely mess up an order you'd discount it or something... But no, was charged full price for a shitty sandwich, and he didn't even apologize. The name of these sandwiches isn't even similar. He repeated to me when I ordered what I had asked for... But then made something different. What the hell?!I really like Quiznos, and it's frustrating that so many of the locations hav
3774;By far the worst Quizno's and fast food place I've ever been to. The owner (Asian dude) yelled at me for trying to use a coupon even though the coupon was for that location. I literally walked out and promised to never return. It's sad to see a busines owner so totally clueless on how to run a business and create loyal customers.
3775;Second time coming to this location and the second time they fail to change gloves between handling money and making your sub. F'n gross. Has to be a health code violation. Never again will I go there.
3776;Quiznos is fast food but most sandwich places ask you when you order. Do you want cheese, pickles etc. When I questioned them they challenged me. What happened to the customer is always right? Coldest toasted sub that I have ever ordered. Hope I don't get good poisoning! Last time I visit there. Employees need an attitude transplant.
3777;And they've officially shut down, not surprised at all this place was terribly run.
3778;Food quality has really declined at Quiznos in general, and this location in particular. Bring a magnifying glass if you want to be able to see the meat in the sandwiches they sell now. It's a shame, Quiznos used to be really good.
3779;Refused to honor a head office coupon and then treated us rudely. Decent food but customer service needs to be addressed. Thankfully there are plenty of restaurants around us so I will not need to return.
3780;Ordered the Family Value Pack (6 legs meal), and then took it home to find out they gave me the Family Pack (whole chicken meal). This doesnt work when trying to feed 4 adults and 2 kids.....Needless to say, we won't be back
3781;I ordered fish and chips. Two bites into my fish, I realize the middle of the fillet was raw. I sent it back, and I was polite about it. It's not the server's fault. My food was replaced no problem, however I'm a bit upset that I was still charged full price for my meal.  I feel that, when food is undercooked and sent back, it should be complimentary. I will not be returning to this restaurant because of my bill and no apologizes made for the undercooked fish.
3782;I gave it a shot.  I will probably not go back.  It was bland and the chicken souvlaki was tough
3783;We have given this place many tries.And is always disappointed in the service. The owner seems to want to cut cost and always only cook two meat items each time. Every time I order I need to wait at least 20-45 mins as they don't have enough meat item. We tried to call ahead and was still provided with a crazy wait time. Not Pleased!If it wasn't the only place for lamb shank in Stouffville I wouldn't return.
3784;The delivery is ALL wrong except for the mains. I did not like the food and the Taziki sauce is way to runny.   I will not ever order from them again and I tipped the delivery guy for no reason. Give me a reason why you didn't get my delivery right? And I've had way better Greek then this.
3785;READ THIS VERY CAREFULLY. I'll make this straight to the point: The food here, generally tastes good and seems of a better quality of what you normally gets from the competitors.However, I feel that this place deserves a 1 stars only because you can't rate them 0 stars. And here below you'll see the reason of my rating. This is not the first time that I hear colleagues complaining about either being overcharged compared to the advertized price or having the feeling that something was missing or different from the item previously ordered.Today, I had reason to believe that probably my coworkers were telling me the truth. For three days I bought the same item. For two days I walked away not knowing that I have been served with a sandwich that had different ingredient/s from the one advertised because an employee decided to. It did not taste like expected but because of the look, I couldn't tell exactly what it was. Were the ingredients not so good? Was something simply not added? Hard to tell. So to
3786;Had a slice of quiche today that smelt like fish. There was no fish in or near it so I assumed it was really old, threw it in the bin and swore to never return. Had been a couple of times prior and had okay experiences, but I won't be back after this!
3787;Bad service. Ordered chicken wings over the phone and was yelled at by one of them. Never again. Garbage place.
3788;This location is very badly managed, and the manger is very rude and arrogant. The pizza wasn't even displayed before being handed over, even when asked to do so, by the customer. The reason being there weren't enough toppings on it. When asked why, the manager said take it if you want to. Never going back to Popular Pizza again, because of this incident!
3789;This place sucks, I am sorry but it does, we have ordered deliveries and takeoutsboth times no quality or taste, if you are doing a in store pick they also have HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE yes i know they are Halal and they have Tandoor chicken Topping, but I rather make my own pita bread pizza at home then order from them I would stay away Thank you for reading PS if you only eat Halal and you have no other options, then go for it
3790;Worst pizza I have ever eaten. If I can give it a 0 start I would. I don't know what happened to this place I used to crave there pizzas I don't know if the owners changed but they cheap out on toppings, EVEN THE CHEESE! We actually had parts of the pizza with no cheese and no sauce! HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!
3791;The owner touches a bunch of non food items and places orders on the phone then gets back to continuing making the pizza. Gross. The older gentleman who delivers came back and went directly to making pizza without washing his hands.
3792;Unreal this place sucks sooo bad, no cheese, and they charged us for two topping for chicken but when we got it had couple of small chicken pieces..Don't waste your money.. Spend $5 more bucks and go to pizza Nova...
3793;Went there today for some soup. It was just blahh! Not much flavor to it. Plus I think the guy should've asked me at least what size I want. He didn't even tell me that there are two sizes. I guess he just wanted to make a sale for higher amount. The quantity was huge. I couldn't finish it all.
3794;Terribly stale food.  The chicken was inedible.  Informed manager as an FYI, even told him we didn't want money back or to get anything else but he still became defensive and flat out denied it was stale.  Terrible food and service.
3795;The only reason I'm giving them one star is because I have no choice. Came here for lunch today, I got the stir-fry with noodles, started eating it was ok, not the best but just ok.  look down at my fork.... there is a hair mixed with my noodles, now I just wasted $9.50, still hungry cause I wasn't even close to half way.  I'm pissed, I waste my money, gas and time
3796;Bad staff and the food is not clean and I'm not happy and you wait to much for delivery
3797;I love pizza and would consider Pizza Hut my favourite chain. This location on Morningside happens to be the closest and most convenient for me. Unfortunately, this location also has the worst quality of pizza I have ever had. Almost every time I've ordered there, the pizza has had no cheese and/or is undercooked. Last time I decided to show the staff my pizza with no cheese. They apologized and made a new pizza, which is now undercooked AND still had no cheese. If you enjoy eating dough and pizza sauce I would highly recommend this place. As for me, I'm never going back. Life's too short for less than mediocre pizza.
3798;We had our issues with delivery from this location before and I've sworn up and down to NEVER order Pizza Hut again but here we are ... today we order 2 large pizza and 1 order of garlic bread and pizzas were pretty basic believe it or not ! The email confirm received showed delivery to be expected by 650pm yes I know this is an estimate and after numerous calls to the store and being reassured the driver was on his way pizza finally arrived at 750pm 1 whole hour after the estimated time !! Needless to say we sent the driver away with our cold order and took the alternate to feed the STARVING children. HORRIBLE SERVICE I promise this time will definitely be the last time I swear !!!
3799;Poor customer service, would not adhere to my dietary restrictions. Illogical explanation, apparently the oven will blow up if you substitute for vegetarian toppings. Just go to the Hurontario and Eglinton Pizza Hut, customer service is much better there.
3800;The place is dirty and the service is the worst. They make pizza with bare hands (which i think is the same case for all other pizza place) but the problem is that they also handle cash and computer at the same time. They do not have dedicated cashier at the place. Seemed so dirty that I did not eat my pizza. Also, the general manager of the place is so rude, so loud, and so sneaky. He has no logic. When a customer said he ordered a small one when he was given a large chocolate dunker, the manager said that he can only charge for large since they made large and that he was so busy to argue. The customer asked why he has to take reponsibility when the mistake was made on Pizza Hut side. The manager answered that he did not take the order so it was not his fault and that he was so busy to argue. The customer was so ridiculed and left the place while shaking his head. While the manager spoke this, he was terribly loud that the customer did mot want to continue any further. I was very angry at the manager even th
3801;I get that this place is super cheap for buffets prices, I mean $10 for dinner wow! However, the food was terrible. Although we arrived as soon as dinner started the food was old, reheated and just gross. The salad bar was a sad scene with head lettuce and 2 types of dressing and a few slices cucumber. Dessert was a few cookies and a smashed up quarter piece of cheesecake. Some of the food (basa in special sauce) actually tasted rotten and I had to immediately spit it out. You usually get what you pay for but in this instance I feel thoroughly ripped off.
3802;Where to start. I hate writing bad about places but this place is just beyond horrible. No one deserves to eat here even if it is for 10 bucks. I came here once before when it was Panda buffet. The food was horrible and i vowed never to come here. Afterwards , when they changed to Dragon Handroll , my stupid brain thought maybe the food might have gotten better. Nope! Just as horrible as always. Flavorless, too much salt, cold and disgusting. I mean when the only thing the person liked in the buffet was the fruit, there is something wrong for sure. The sushi was gross, and we literally left after 10 minutes. Could not even chew on anything. Please skip this place if you are even thinking of it. It will save you 10 bucks and a lot more pain and suffering.Cheers.
3803;Just like another yelper, my parents also insisted trying this place out due to an ad in a chinese newspaper. Paid $11.99/person on New Year's Day! Once my parents and I were seated, the waitress kept pressuring us to start eating twice even though our other guests have yet to arrive - I couldn't understand the reason why she would tell us that. The restaurant overall wasn't super busy either. The atmosphere was quite poor. The floors were sticky. We were sat in the middle with booths. Oddly, the booth seating felt like I was sitting on a park bench. The seat was half the size of normal chairs!! It was quite uncomfortable. As for a previous yelper showed those torn, cracking old chairs, they still have the same chairs!! They just covered them with a new seating cushion. As for the food, the selection was small in comparison to most buffets. They had the usual, sweet & sour pork, lemon chicken, mixed veggies, chow mein, fried rice and etc. Their sushi wasn't the greatest - mushy & too much rice, which is qui
3804;We went there all the way from North York and a small crowd standing outside on a Saturday evening. Apparently the place is closed...not sure if it was closed for the day or closed forever.
3805;It was a nightmare....poor taste, poor service, poor everything.... my 9 year old daughter could cook better than them.....it was such a waste of money and time....I will NEVER come back here again....and I don't think this place will last long with these kind of food and services they are currently serving to their customers.
3806;I was expecting what I was coming for but wanted to give a second chance to that restaurant.Don't know how they respect the customer with the poor quality of foods they have and the poor choice. The food is tasteless and cold not warmed enough as much as poor selection and quantity of food in display. Before i went I called and was told that the price was a promotion but find out it is the regular price posted on the window and they had shrimps but someone had to insist to have the shrimps as they were not present at our arrival and when they put in the tray it is so little that it feeds only one or two persons. A customer was complaining that the stuff in the trays was leftover from the lunch and so did it appear as the food was luke warm even if it was 6 PM. The restaurant is empty and one or two customers come at the time.The ice cream is either very soft or hard like a rock and can not be pulled from the container, the spoons are cheap and they even have plastic one in the tray for the dessert. The q
3807;The selection of food was poor, the food itself was poor - had to spit most of my food out after taking a bite because of an odd taste. The meat has a weird smell and seems expired or of cheap quality. Food is never refilled when empty....but I expected all of this from the price - $12.99 dinner on weekends.
3808;Parents insisted we come here when they saw the newspaper advertisement for $11.99 per person. Food was quite terrible and everything was drowned in either sauce or oil. Best item here hands down is the ice cream but it's the generic ice cream found at sushi buffets anyways. I would recommend others to go to a McDonald's for a better meal in terms of cost and taste.
3809;Dragon Handroll is really as bad as everyone says. I'm not going to reiterate what was already said about the food, but the service was actually okay. And hey, it's only $11 for an all you can eat dinner you get what you paid for. However, if you decide to swing by this buffet for a meal, I suggest to steer clear of the sushi and to try the green tea ice cream. Parking is ample and this restaurant is located at the intersection of two bus routes, so no worries on that front.
3810;So many things are wrong :- Fish still tasted frozen- Sushi is tiny and mostly rice - Fried fish was too salty - Noodles were too soft/soggy- Ginger for sushi was very acetic - Chicken wings were too soggy - Chicken balls were too tough- Soup and salad tasted funny - Limited variety - Ran out of most food at 7:30pm (maybe earlier) when it closes at 10pm- Lack of service - The list goes on ..... What can you expect when dinner buffet price is $9.99 (Tuesday only). I wanted to give this place more than 1 star, considering the price, but I just can't.Like walking out of a strip club (Caddy's is across the street), I was ashamed I went here LOL
3811;Do not eat at this place. Found a cockroach in my food. He tried to make me pay still and we told him no way and left. The manager acted like it was no big deal. Brimley and egliton
3812;this place is the old panda buffet but worse.. they got rid of the soups and tofu dessert.. in place of the most ghetto sushi section ever.  the rolls they kept pushing out were really bad rolls with little to no salmon or fish... mad stinge to the max.  and they were putting the seaweed salad in the rolls with mayonaise all over the top.  just wierd creations that didnt work..my water was empty for the longest time.  if you want to see a sad buffet that is holding on by a thread, this is the place to go.  its all bad quality chinese food and everything is fried.
3813;This place looks sad.The employees look sad.The food looks sad.I was sad.My stomach is sad.Never again.Ever.No one deserves to spend money or even waste calories on this.Don't do this to yourself.
3814;Gawd awful. Chicken balls were tough. Selection sparse. Serve room temp water. AWFUL!!!! I rarely leave a restaurant without tipping. Service was awful and food awful, so NO TIP FOR YOU!!!
3815;Save your money and go somewhere else. Small selection and they put out very little of each food item at a time. There is actually a person standing behind the glass watching you get your food! So awkward! The price was enticing but definitely a disappointment once there.
3816;I live one block from this restaurant and decided to try takeout.  I wanted a combo plate of General Tao chicken.  They wouldn't do a combo plate.  Only option is to buy an order of General Chicken and Pork fried rice for $16.  A good restaurant would have done a combo plate and maybe charged a dollar or two more for the substitution.  I walked out and went to the wing place across the street.  I found another Chinese restaurant that does a combo plate of General Taos chicken and they also deliver.  I will never step foot in this neighbourhood restaurant again.
3817;NEVER AGAIN!The only reason it even gets a one rating is because a rating has to be chosen.We've ordered from this place before but through Just-Eat.ca.  This time we ordered over the phone because the drink choices online were not up to date.I specifically gave them the directions to our place because there happen to be two streets with the same name in the Richmond Hill area.  When our food still didn't arrive 1hr & 10 minutes after my call, I knew the driver had screwed up and went to the wrong street.Called the restaurant - 3 times - to ask them to get hold of their driver to give him the right directions.  After far too many excuses, empty promises of the driver being there soon and too many "don't know what to tell you...blah blah blah" got a call from the driver.  Had to tell him several times how to get there and he still passed the driveway 3 times (was waiting outside for him by this time).By the time we got our order, 1 hr & 40 minutes had passed.  Needless to say, the 'food' was cold.  WORST
3818;This is the first time I ever walked in and out of a restaurant. I went in there with my family to grab some food. There were two guys working. The one 'greeting' the customers at the register couldn't have been more dismissive. My husband walked in first, said hi, got ignored. I walked in after, said hello, got ignored. The register guy stood there rolling his eyes while we looked at the menu like he was extremely bothered and inconvenienced by this family that just walked in. I didn't say anything but looked at my husband and expressed that I didn't trust putting the food that is served at this location in my mouth and we went next door to subway instead. My Greek food craving was not fulfilled that day.
3819;My first clue was probably that the place is always empty when I go by, but I was hungry for Greek food. Walked in, got ignored walked put. I was standing there for almost five minutes before a man walks up and asks if he can help me like I'm trash off the street. I said I guess not....and walled out.Never again.Wish I could yelp half a star.
3820;This restaurant's ventilation was insufficient as soon as you walk in. You are overwhelmed by the grilling atmosphere in the whole restaurant. We had a pork and chicken plate and calamari. The chicken was very dry and same with the pork. The salad and rice were very bland. The calamari was mediocre as well. I don't think I will be goings back to this restaurant anytime soon.......
3821;Worst greek in the neighborhood.  Not very tasty and the portion is super stingy!!  And considering the price vs portion, what a rip off.  I'd rather spend my $12 at Wendy's.
3822;This McDonald's is a strong contender for the worst in the franchise. Service is slow, orders are often wrong (who doesn't love finding something you didn't order in the bag when you're 10km down the road?) and last week the lid wasn't put on my drink properly so it spilled all over me in the drive through. Several staff saw it happen, and apologized, but did they offer to comp my meal? No. Customer service basics need some work.
3823;I love McDonald's but DO NOT EAT INSIDE this location. It's dirty and will make you feel even worse about your food choice. Do yourself a favour and do drive-thru. Double check your bag before you leave. I've had to drive back for items on several occasions.
3824;Closed from 1-6 am just dont give them business. Islington location is the best or queensway or on Dundas.
3825;Worst McDonald's location I have been to. Over charged me and when I asked why they said they prices went up despite the drive through sign saying differently. The manager got involved which said the prices were the same and claimed a different price. After this experience the manager said "I hope you don't get into a car accident today" as I drove off from the drive through. This was so unprofessional that I reported it to McDonald's head office. I am unsure about what will come if this.  Needless to say I will not be going back to this location.
3826;This is literally the slowest moving staffed McD I've ever witnessed..  Three people in line is enough to turn around and leave.  It's almost as if it's off head offices radar, no man's land McDonald's.  Needs a facelift and has a grimy, gross mini kids playland for the little loud annoying white trash kids of new toronto.
3827;This is by FAR the worst trained staff in any McDonald's in any town/city/province, country or continent in the world. I live around the corner of this newly renovated establishment. I come here once a week, we have two kids and they of course live the Happy Meal toys. I also take my eldest daughter here on Sunday mornings to play at the play land. Disclaimer: what I'm about to say is 100% true. 9/10 times I come here, they get our order grossly incorrect. Either missing items, wrong beverages or wrong sandwiches and always missing sauces for the nuggets. The problem is that the staff is not trained properly. Managment is incompetent or just doesn't give two $hi!'$. Whatever it is, it's horrendous and simply put, bad for your brand. You will survive as people still flock toward the drive-thru, but it takes minimal effort to get the orders right, if your staff were properly trained and motivated. McDonald's of Lakeshore... Fix yourself. Do it for the humanity of Mimico.
3828;I wish I could give you no stars.I know it's just McDonalds, but when I want to eat fast crap I don't want throw out half of mine and my husbands meals because its covered in onions and there is more cheese on the cardboard box than on my burger. "NO ONIONS" means no onions!We waited in the drive-thru for what seemed like an eternity for $23 worth of dry, hard old fries, a quarter pounder that was terrible and a Big Mac that someone made with their eyes closed.  Avoid this location.
3829;This is by far the worst McDonalds I have ever visited.The first incident included a wrong order from the drive-thru (forgot to include an order of fries that I'd paid for) - I understand that this happens and was partially my fault as I should have checked before driving away, but it was just the first in a string of bad experiences.Next, on two seperate occasions I'd gone in for a simple chocolate milkshake. A staple at McDonalds. Nope - they were all out. The first time the cashier hadn't realized and I'd paid first and so asked for my money back. Needing a manager to refund the money, this guy came over and tried hard to sell me another flavor instead. Offering other options, I understand. Taking over a minute to try to convince me that I wanted something I didn't when I kept repeating that I just needed a refund was plain old bad customer service.The absolute worst though, was one night when I went in for a sundae. The place was nearly empty and there were about 5 people behind the counter, just ig
3830;I have gone to this location a few times and it had not been too bad but on my last visit I nearly broke a tooth on my food. Several pieces of tile were hidden in my sub. Maybe don't eat here.
3831;I don't know if all Subway locations are like this but these guys are absolutely incompetent! Make sure to watch them as they make your sub because these 'artists' like to take creative liberties.Sometimes toasted is forgotten, cheese is omitted and salt and pepper are laid on so thick they should be charged as their own condiment.The staff is slow and if you happen to be there when there is a lineup, they will actually make everyone's sub first THEN they will let you pay. This means that your sub's path from oven to mouth may take you over 10 minutes on a busy day.
3832;- Slowest service ever. The way they made the sandwiches was extremely slow. Even worse was when the sandwiches were wrapped up. There was only 2 people in front with 2 simple subs, and yet it took 15 mins for me to get mine (1/2 people's subs was almost done as I ordered by the way). While they made my sandwich, very slowly, there was 3 more people behind me. The employees had no rush or care that there was a line up due to the fact they were moving slow like they didn't care. - The 2 employees were speaking Indian (I believe) to each other as customers asked for specific things - so who knows what they said. They would make comments to each other after customers had special requests or comments about their food. - They couldn't even make a sandwich properly. I've had Subway for many years since I was child and every location (in Canada and the US) laid the turkey the same way, folded on an angle on the sub on one side. This place just put 2 big stacks turkey breast (4 pieces of turkey in each stack), ju
3833;My family and I had the worst experience in this restaurant. We came here on a Thursday afternoon. It was absolutely not busy. We requested to be seated outside and it took about 15 minutes to be seated although there were seats ready outside. It was a hot summer day but our table was soaked. They couldn't bother to bus the table. We ordered mostly pitchers of beer seeing as it's mid-afternoon we were just looking for refreshing beer and snacks. The server just took away our empty cups and handed the bill right away. We still wanted more beer. The server never asked if we wanted more beer. She just handed the bill and asked if we needed change. NOBODY IN THE GROUP ASKED FOR THE BILL. Also, the restaurant was disgusting. Nobody cleans the washrooms. Toronto Islands is a beautiful tourist attraction however, you don't get a real Canadian experience with this restaurant. As a Canadian, I take pride in the fact that we are courteous and civilized. This restaurant is filled with ill-mannered and incompetent sta
3834;Do yourself a favour and never step foot in this place. My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to grab a quick cup of tea on the island because it was late in the afternoon and the temperature was dropping. We were immediately seated at an extremely dirty table that did not look like it had been cleaned in a few days. We then proceeded to wait a good 15 minutes for service even though there were only two tables out on the patio and one table indoors (ours). We also both got up to go to the bathroom (also disgusting) at various times during our wait and walked right by the servers booth, where the servers were congregating to gossip-- it's not like we did not make ourselves invisible. We eventually called over the "host" who feigned surprise that we had not been served and called over our waitress. Our waitress approached the table and said--without a smile or a greeting-- "What are you having." We asked for two cups of tea and she then said that we could actually help ourselves at the self-se
3835;This place is exactly what you'd expect. It's smack dab in the middle of Tourist Island, therefore the options are boring and overpriced.The only saving grace is that the service was good. Also, they had beer.A group of us dropped in here after paddling to the island, so we were famished. We ordered regular and turkey burgers, onion rings, fries, jerk chicken and chicken fingers. None of us were all that impressed with the food. My burger was definitely the frozen variety. I know because I've purchased it at the grocery store before. It's cut into the shape of a cloud to simulate hand-formed patties. All in all, it made me regret not packing a picnic lunch for the day.
3836;Some of the slowest, most disinterested service I have ever encountered. Nothing improved after I complained, either. The host in particular needs a serious change in attitude.Food is overpriced and of poor quality. My pasta tasted as if was subjected to a literal bucketful of pepper. I didn't realise it was possible to screw up spaghetti bolognese that badly.Washrooms are disgusting. Never again.
3837;Pretty funny that the only other review of this place is also from today - maybe we were sitting in the same section?  Anyway, I was at this place earlier this afternoon.  Upon arrival we were greeted by a humorless "hostess" who dumped us at our table without a word.  Our server seemed pleasant enough, but when the food came our opinions changed for the worse.  The "Canadian Fries" looked as though they had been sitting out on the counter for an hour, complete with lukewarm, limp fries, congealed cheese and stale bacon bits.  The BLT was pretty much inedible, with way too much dry ciabatta and barely any of the actual lettuce, tomato and what I assume was instant microwave bacon.  Barely touched any of it.  Waited forever for the server to come back, but she didn't, so we got tired of waiting and went looking for the bill.  Found her sitting in the back reading a book??  Finally got the bill which was a staggering $45 for 2 sandwiches, a plate of fries and 3 pops.  Talk about a tourist trap.  Oh, and the was
3838;Bad service comes included in every meal. Staff are bored out of their mind and have no interest in their job.
3839;Some key points for I don't feel this place warrants a long review.- Over priced- Sat us outside without asking preference.- Extremely outdated. Pepto-pink walls.- Freezer fresh taste to the fries.- Washrooms were disgusting.Didn't want to waste money on low quality food. Got yam fries and water. About right quality for the only thing open during non-peak months.
3840;the worst experience ever. rude service. slow, dirty washrooms. bad food. and the free refill drink we asked for was given to us in dirty cup full of one large chunk of ice and yellowish color coke cola or god know what
3841;I wish I could give a 0 star. Spinach dip was disgusting and deep fried for some reason. Lots of wasps and service was terrible!! The bill was 50 bucks for two and we weren't even full.
3842;Just do yourself a favor and do not eat here! We were really hungry but could not finish the awful greasy burger or turkey sandwich that came with chicken because they didn't have turkey today! While we had to listen to annoying loud music when having lunch! The quality and taste is reminiscent of shabby gas station diners of 80s!!
3843;And when I say "one star", I'd actually prefer NO star. Donna, the manager, ruined what would have been a pleasant experience. It's your typical fare, the décor has some carousel horses but it's kitschy and the menu is a tad overpriced. A couple of friends and I checked it out cuz we weren't too picky. We were seated outside, the food (calamari and fish and chips) was decent, and they had a few beers available. As we finished our meal, it began to rain so we came inside. I paid for the bill, wanting to make sure our server got the tip. We then went to sit at another table so we could split some dessert. First off, before we could sit the manager rudely told us to move so she could get through. All right. We sat down awkwardly. The next time she came through she asked to see ID (no waters offered). Okay no problem, we were well in our 20's and 30's. Then she asked us what we wanted and we said we want to split one dessert. She flat out refused and said "I'm not serving you one, you're three people so you
3844;Over priced!!! The chicken wings were all broken and tasted like they came straight from a long summer in the deep freeze.   Drink beer and don't eat anything if you value your insides.
3845;This place is so bad that if it was in the city it would have been gone a long time ago.Service is slow. Took over five minutes to get anyone to come to the table. Ordered a soup (something that they don't have to cook), they took the order and then in 30 ... THIRTY! minutes they came back saying they don't have the soup. Thanks so much.
3846;Avoid this place if you can. The service was very slow. Our waitress seemed disinterested in how we were. They brought my beer, and then a minute later another waitress brought me another beer - OOPS! I only ordered one!The food wasn't memorable. The french fries were oven baked and under done. Do they not have a deep fryer? If you are serving pub food (which is what this place does), you NEED deep fryers. My fries reminded me of something I might make in my toaster oven out of desperation on a Saturday night.A hot dog meal (dog, fries, a sad, small pile of coleslaw) costs $9. The kids meal is $10, and includes choice of entree (my kids had pizza), a beverage, and ice cream.The only reason I would ever stop in again is if I needed a quick beer at the bar.
3847;Undercooked burgerService was okPrices were a $$$ not a $$ as yelp suggests..I'd go here(location/service) for a beer again not to dine.
3848;At 25$ per person this is the worst value in Toronto Island. Don't spoil a great day by eating microwave fast food.The spinach dip was disgusting. The burger was much worst than a microwave frozen burger. The chicken sandwich was cold and the fish and chip were so gross I was speechless.Oh! And I almost forgot... This was by far the worst service I've ever experienced in Toronto
3849;Absolutely horrible dining experience. The service is SLOW and RUDE. The place wasn't even that busy and we waited an 1.5 hours for food while other tables that came in after us were served ahead of us.Peaked into kitchen out on my way out of bathroom -- NASTY. There's gotta be some health code violations.Our food was cold and flavorless. Simply put: horrible.DO NOT GO HERE!
3850;Very bad experience and will never order again :(. We called and ordered and the lady told us 20 to 25 minutes, but when we got there they told us another 20 minutes. We waited there for an 1 hour and 15 minutes for our food because they were very busy that day, so we didn't say anything. When we got home, we started eating and found a black hair in our food and immediately called the restaurant , and they offer to delivery another one to us. The other food was very watery, and the sweet and sour chicken was still a little pink inside and the sweet and sour sauce was very sweet :/. We will not be back.
3851;Foods bland and the people are just as bad. I've ordered takeout three times from this place and each time there was something wrong with our order. Not to mention that when you call to ask a question they give you some pretty dumb responses. Most recently I called to ask how big their Sea Food soup was. Small, medium or large would have sufficed. It instead they tried to be smart about it and said "how am I to show you the bowl through the phone." I simply wanted to know if it would be enough as a meal for my wife.Decided that it's better to simply drive the 25 minutes to our old area to pick up good Chinese food.
3852;Added more to our order while waiting for our food, was told I was 3 mins past 3 o Clock. I told the waitress that I had already placed our order and was trying to get her attention for the past 5 mins. She did not look happy. Got the take out meal - It was 90% rice and a surprise GUM SPIT into my meal. The fact she told the time to spit gum into my food cause I added an order 3 mins late but the food had to be thrown out.
3853;Extremely rude service while placing a phone order. When wanting to add/change something to my order calling back after not even two minutes, was told that it was impossible to change the order in a rude and loud tone. Phone was placed down for a couple seconds without notice, could hear shouting in the background, then asked what my new order is. Felt discouraged to re-order and cancelled the order entirely.Not a fan of rude and impatient customer service.
3854;TERRIBLE. I put in a dietary request to cook separate from all meat (sensitivity to pork) and in the bottom of my container there was small pieces of meat. NEVER GOING BACK. DO NOT RECOMMEND.
3855;I am from Philly originally, and I decided to try this out after some people have told me it was good.  I am sorry to say this is nothing that is even close to a authentic cheesesteak.  For the ones who thinks this is good, go to Philly, get a real cheesesteak from there, and then compare.
3856;I disagree with the good reviews - the place smells like bad fish, the floors and cutlery are dirty and the staff is rude. Went in once, was put off by the rude staff and the smell. Won't go back. Gross!
3857;New ownership, and now service is abrupt, overcharged/upsold, and skimpier toppings. Take a pass and try one of the other nearby restaurants.
3858;I have been working in MR.PIDE for over a year, and I have few things to share about this place, this place was one of the best Turkish Restaurants in Toronto and last summer the owner has changed and then everything changed the quality of the food and the way they run the business and the way they treat the customers, when you are served in this place they serve vegetables and then they bring to left over and place them with the new ones so basically they reseling the vegetables that have been already served and then they trying to save on the garbage bags, the place is not been cleaned properly and the half full garbages never thrown so there is always flies in the restaurant because this. So if you guys care about the quality and behaviour you would not eat there not deal with the fake people and also they buy the meat from stores on danforth when they say it has been bought from halal food farms so please make your decison do you like to be fooled or do you care about the truth these are the truths
3859;I read the glowing reviews for this place and was really looking forward to it. As soon as we got there, it smelled really good so I got really excited..Then the beef tendon skewers came. Tendon? I doubt it. more like grilled chunks of pure animal fat (which were flavourless btw). That was enough to kill if for me. That and the fact they messed up my order (i tried to get that shredded lamb and pancakes dish and they brought out some microscopic pieces on toothpicks instead - not only awkward to eat but subsequently awkward to digest!)The service wasn't particularly great either. they completely forgot about the last dish we ordered. We had to politely remind them to bring us our final heart attack on a plate. The food there is WAY too oily. The crispy beef is heavily deep fried chunks of beef with no flavor.The only saving grace was a lamb noodle dish with a tomato garlic and onion sauce (You really do kinda see where the italians ripped it off from). An island of goodness in an otherwise sea of greasy
3860;This place is awful. It's severely overpriced compared to similar restaurants, the service is awful, and the food is GREASY.We ordered a pretty standard dish, the sliced beef wrapped in onion pancake. The price was $6, and what came was a single roll. For that price, it better be so good that it cures cancer, or have 2 rolls. It was neither. The roast lamb was $19.99 (large size price) for a small small dish. I expect to pay more for good quality food, but this stuff was cheap and greasy (more on that in a sec).The service sucked. Now, I understand when sometimes an order is forgotten or delayed a bit. I've got no problems with following up with the waiters. It happens all the time at AYCE sushi joints and understandably so -- places are usually super busy with limited staff. But Xinjiang takes this to a new level. It wasn't even busy when we went (there were a few empty tables). We waited about 30 mins for our last dish and asked 3 different servers at least twice each about the dish. Each time it was "I
3861;My family and I have come here a few times in the past- the food was pretty good, and the service was ok- nothing amazing, but nothing terrible either. The cumin lamb from Backyard garden in the same plaza is more flavourful- we like our food spicy, and the seasonings in the lamb didn't do it for any of us. I did enjoy the handmade noodles and nan.But this time we had a terrible experience. The food was mediocre- some of the food came cold... and other dishes tasted canned/ not fresh and the service was extremely slow. We got one dish on average every 30 minutes . Two and a half hours later one of my family members started feeling sick, so we asked if we could cancel our last dish. They told us in a rude tone that "everyone else was waiting too"- which is more problematic than a good excuse, and they said that our dish was almost done, which was a lie- we had to wait another 30-40 minutes before our food arrived, and it wasn't a dish that would take so long to cook/ prepare.I don't blame the slow service 
3862;Before I came here, friends told me service is very bad, I told them I don't mind, as long as the food is good, but after I got here with my kids, I realized service really horrible, not worth it
3863;traveled to toronto  with my wife and  had dinner this evening. i never ever minded paying  for a dinner up until tonightwe .started out with roasted peppers in olive oil - tasteless but the worst part was the portion that amounted to 4 table spoons $ 8.00 - our entree was seafood fettachini $31.00 2 shrimp - 3 mussels - and what looked to be some lobster meat - wtf give me a break awful experience!!
3864;This isn't Italian it's cafeteria food warmed in the back.First off, ordered "seafood pasta" got 3 tinny shrimp I mean tinny the kind you get in a can, 1 very small clam which turned out to be a mussel.I didn't know seafood came in such small pieces?Maybe it's restaurant size to fit the big plates...I don't think the food is cooked here, I think they buy prepared food from catering companies that do just that and warm it in a convection oven.Most restaurants do just that. Most folks don't know that.All this place has going for it? Location, location.Expensive, but not value for your $$$$.I don't mind paying for food I enjoy, I mind spending a small fortune on food I can get at the frozen section of Costco.Most folks in Toront think frozen wings fried in oil lathered with BBQ sauce (made of mostly sugar) is gourmet food?It's sad!Please don't use this posting as a negative review, you should go.There is another  place as (Terroni) on queen st for "southern Italian " food where they think we're stu
3865;NEVER GET SEATED!!! WAIT FOR 3 HOURS!!!Me and my boyfriend was trying to get a table around 7pm and the guy outside said they have no space right now if we want we can come back at 8:30, me and my boyfriend agreed and booked our name for 8:30. so we came back at the time because I really wanna try their seafood risotto. The guy told us he was surprised that they still had no space blablabla and told us to wait for another half hour, I gave him my number and asked he to call me immediately when table is available. We were sooooo hungry and cold, me and my boyfriend waited across the street for a bit and saw people walking out like they were just finished!!! And He just dont let us in!!!! We waited till 9:20 he never called me or anything. we end up having instant noodle at home right now.I just dunt understand why he dont let us in, like 3 hours!!!! and he said they have no reservation after 8:30. Until close!!!! no space?? guess he just dont want us in. but why????It feels like we are on some black list o
3866;Took a friend to this restaurant for her birthday. They must have been having a very bad night. It seemed like it was going to be great, when the owner greeted us and told us that everything was made on site and to order. Two hours later when we still hadn't been served our meals and had already waited for nearly an hour for an appetizer that was comprised of bread and cold cuts, were told be a frazzled owner that well, it's made to order you know. We had ordered the specials, I had to send mine back because it was completely terrible. Very small portions all around. And we weren't properly taken care of on the bill after all. Frustrating and really spoiled my friends birthday.
3867;Super overrated. 200% disappointed with the quantity of their ramen. The ramen costed  me $12 for a small bowl of ramen with one egg and TWO pecies of pork belly (pork belly is one of the cheapest part from pork). the soup and noodle was not even that great. I would rather have a decent extra large pho for 10 bucks with tons of beef and noodle.
3868;Worst "Japanese" ramen I've ever tasted.They have this stench on their soup broth where it makes it impossible to taste the tonkotsu...Their "special" chicken they advertised look liked fried red spicy wings...but it came out brown and steamed...and had the oyster sauce funk. I was craving Japanese ramen during my trip here and after coming to this restaurant first...I was traumatized to try any other ramen houses in Toronto o.o
3869;Crappy.  Don't bother.  Small place but can get loud.  Only serve pork in the ramen and the pork smells funny. Every breath I take I get that smell.  Makes me wanna puke.  Super suspicious that they don't have any other meat available.  Noodles taste kind of old. Overall don't bother. There are so many better options along the street. Also they charge for tea (wtf)  and don't have sake
3870;The manager Kai, messed up my order (don't know how many messed up orders he did beforehand, causing a long line) he can not tell the difference between the different jellies. It caused me to wait extra long, for my correct drink again, and by this time my metered parking outside had expired and I'm left with a ticket for an extra $40 bucks. Totally not worth my time. This was one of the most expensive bbt I have had.
3871;I don't even want to give chatime half a star. I bought honeydew milk tea with aloe Vera jelly and it was disgusting. My drink looks and tastes like regular tea even though the label says honeydew milk tea. The aloe Vera jelly was also disappointing. The customer service was horrible. I was hoping to order my drink in the super cup and instead of explaining that I am unable to order certain drinks, I was given a vague answer. I had to find out why by myself through the internet. It would have been much more convenient to the paying costumer if they could at least explain or answer my questions. The music was so loud making it easy for the employees to dismiss me. This place is not worth my time and money. I will not be coming back.
3872;Customer service is horrible!!The guy who has beard and wears glasses is super super rude.He doesn't voice out to my questions and really unkind.Terrible attitude.I can't believe why he is hired as a customer service at cashier.He is the worst staff I've ever met in all industry.
3873;Oh god where do I start. So my friend and I were so looking forward to getting some Chatime after dinner. We order, get our drinks for takeout, and leave. Just as we take our first sips in the car, we find that the tapioca is severely undercooked and impossible to chew. What the heck. I'm lucky to not have experienced indigestion after the many attempts to just suck it up and literally, suck the tapioca up. I ordered the Matcha Latte drink, and it was so powdery. I know that with matcha it's generally difficult to get the consistency right, but damn this drink was like sandpaper to the throat. Really disappointed, and won't be coming back.
3874;The cashier named, "ZOE or JOY" were super rude.. I ordered no sugar taro milk tea but she did not note it. So i told her "I said No sugar please" and she was so mad and looked at me very angrily for 3 seconds. I was so embarrassed and I told her that you do not have to stare at me like that. But she just ignored and dumped that. I cannot imagine this kind of attitude even from starbucks. They totally do NOT have customer serving mind but they just like MONEY like many other Chinese restaurants do. Very very disappointed. Even though the quality of beverages are good, those staffs should LEARN HOW TO SERVE customers.
3875;I and my girlfriend visited to my relative in North York on Sunday. At the end of the day, I bought two bubble tea, one for me and one for my girlfriend. 2 hours later, when we were in highway to comeback home, both of us had stomach ache. So, we had to take exit highway, and drive round and round to find public washroom. The quality of bubble tea took us to this bad situation, so I never come here again.
3876;Customer service is horrible. It is just located at a very convenient location. Honestly, if there was a Ten Rens across the street, I would go there in a heartbeat.
3877;K I am really pissed with the cashier staff at this time. The only reason I came here was that I had a buy one get one offer from vicinity. I told them my phone number and showed them the message on my phone. But they said I needed to provide my card. I'm like wtf. Vicinity allows you to use your phone number in place of your card like almost every other place. So pissed off I just wrote this review right as I got into my car. I would be too pissed a mood to drive home if I didn't.  FYI to the owner if they actually care. it's 8:26pm.
3878;There are a few times in life when one must use social media...this is of them. This is the first time I've ever written a review for anything - and that everyone, is not a good thing. The way this Chatime treats their customer is absolutely appalling. Came in to get 2 bubble teas. One was hot and the other one was cold. They didn't give or offer a tray for them. So when I went to open the door to leave the lid of the hot one popped right off and I ended up burning my hand. That wasn't even what I was upset about. The fact that they saw what happened, I told them what happened, And all they did was took a mop to it while my hand was burning... I left extremely confounded by their cold indifference. My friend had to go back in angry explaining to them yet again what happen before they actually did something. Thanks for the horrible tasting free drink Chatime.No, you did not deserve that star. Too bad there are no minuses for this app.
3879;Not even worth half a star.This store has a skinny male staff with glasses that needs serious anger management. Beyond just rude. Psychotic.I left a review on the same staff few months ago. He was there today. Not surprisingly enough, he was being extremely offensive and of course that ruined my time being. When drinks were ready for pickup, he screamed out loud with such tone as "get your drink and get the fuck out of my store". He lined up 4 different drinks and wouldn't even tell me which one was mine. He created scary environment and i could feel the negative vive running very strong. Seriously, he seemed to be ready to kill someone. Made the environment extremely uncomfortable. Chatime needs to know what their staff is doing to their customer isn't simply under-satisfying service. It's a violation. Business that doesn't appreciate the customer will end soon.
3880;Um... for brunch just simply " no ".   We were excited about trying this restaurant as we had read good things on Yelp and heard it mentioned on BT.  Upon entering we were pleasantly surprised - they've done a great job on the interior.  It was a birthday brunch so there were 6 of us.  We started with a  2 orders of scones (2/plate), pickles, and shrimp.  The scones were strangely squares of some sort of cake/bread (so disappointing - definitely NOT scones), the 3 shrimp at $2.50/each were served like like something that should have come from an old school truck stop.  We should have stopped there, but we didnt.  My "Whipped Yoghurt, House Granola, Honey, Fruit Preserve For $12 was a small scoop of not-whipped Greek Yogourt, a little bit of raw oats with a few sunflower seeds, a few diced fruit??? and a drizzle of honey.  The red thing I found floating in my container of cream was a little odd - they brought a replacement, though. The other meals were mediocre.  The avocado toast - though good, just didn't cu
3881;We went for our first time last week. Was so disappointed. I was going to order a glass of wine but not $12 for 5 ounces. I had the halibut fish for $28. Too expensive and I was hungry afterwards. The portion was not worth the price. There are many better restaurants around with better food options and good value. The Brooklyn Tavern is close by. The food and wine and great with great prices!! I will not be returning to this place:)
3882;Average food. Way over priced.The food was almost stinky when it came out of the kitchen... Had a vinegar-Y smell almost like sour toes. Not sure if it was meant to be like that but it sure was potent.Drinks were nice, I enjoyed the Pineapple #3. Pricing was well over priced I mean with such small portions you would assume that things wouldn't be so crazily priced. Anyhow the interior is nice and all but I definitely won't go back because of the stinky food and high prices.
3883;I've been to this "establishment" once in my life and that is once too many.I went with 2 friends and had a pitcher, I think the selection was between swill and recycled on tap. There was a woman passed out in vomit at a table in the corner, couple of toothless old men at the bar and wrestling on the a couple of big screens.There's a sign outside that proclaims they have karaoke, though I wouldn't attend I could only imagine the travesty of slurred Conway Twitty and Loretta Young that would be.At one point the bartender switched the station to hardcore porn and yelled "It ain't wrassling boys but sure is full contact"We finished our beers in an attempt of silence and left.Well at least the beer was really, really cheap.
3884;Maximize profits vs. dining experienceWe made reservations for an early diner to make sure the restaurant was not too busy.  When we arrived, we were promptly seated.  Service is a major thing you pay for and confusion started right away, as they could not figure out who our server would be.  Overall service was poor as food service was slow, server was inattentive and mistakes were made to our order.  The overall menu is sparse with nothing for vegetarians.  The price of sides add up quickly: sausage is two small pucks, bread $5, pickled egg best value $1.50 but undercooked for me.  We felt the menu was overpriced for the quality and especially small portion sizes.We enjoyed the mixed drink selection, as it is creative.  The beer drinker in our group felt the Craft beer selection was good but some big company cartel beers could be eliminated. Frosted mugs are nice but they do require a coaster for the moisture from eventual melting. Wine is expensive starting at $60 a bottle, glasses $2/oz.The décor is 
3885;Was excited to try this place out after seeing great review in Toronto life. Went group of 8 on good Friday .  What a disappointment! Me and a girlfriend both started with beet salad- her shaved beets were so doused in  vinegar they were inedible, mine was missing this part of the dish altogether. For mains 2 ppl at our table ordered lasagna and for 22$ all you got was a slice about 1.5" thick that was almost all pasta- they must have run out in the kitchen or something it was that bad- I got the 3 sausages and they were all quite dry again because sliced so small.  We had the peanut butter mousse for dessert and it was like a warm liquid that wasn't set at all- more like hot chocolate than mousse.  We couldn't complain because our server was barely at our table the entire night- would just drop off food and leave never asking if people liked it but probably didn't care because she had already added her 18% tip on all the cheques.  My husband ordered a beer to go with his entree and didn't get it until after 
3886;I was at Dakota Tavern yesterday for their Bluegrass Sunday Brunch. My family was celebrating a delayed Father's Day so we all went together. I'm celiac and vegan so of course I couldn't eat their brunch but with the rest of my family eating their brunch menu I went to be social and participate in our Father's Day celebration. I didn't eat a thing and told the waitress I wasn't eating. When it was time for the bill my mom said it would be minus me because I did not eat, the waitress said that's fine but I would be charged COVER! Excuse me?! Being celiac and vegan I often can't eat at restaurants and I'm okay with that, but I go to socialize with the other people eating (especially for family celebrations). Never in my life have I been charged cover at a restaurant! It's not like I came to listen to the music, took up an entire table, and did not order... I was with an entire table of people who ate! It was also not explained WHY I was being charged cover. (My mom paid the bill across the table and I didn't kn
3887;The service is pretty poor, and the hamburger patties in my double beef burger were literally the driest, most overcooked pieces of meat I've ever had. I was very disappointed based on all of the great reviews. Maybe this was a one off occurrence, but as I'm only visiting Toronto, I would have an opportunity to give them another chance, nor would I really want to.
3888;Saw good reviews, thought I'd try it.  Bad, bad mistake!Very Slow, indifferent service, it appeared they could care less whether you were in their place or not.  Average quality food, but priced like a Bistro, just plain over-priced for what you get.Then I tried the food.  Over-cooked burger, burnt outside and dry inside, and my date got undercooked chicken.  I finished eating (half was all I could stomach), before they returned with anew plate, and it was undercooked again (pink inside beside the bones).We left, they offered no refund, and again appeared they could care less about our experience at their establishment.Unfortunately you have to give at least one star on Yelp.  They didn't deserve it.Avoid at all costs.
3889;It took 35 mins just to get a strawberry shake it takes too long horrible customer service
3890;Raw food... why not take something that tastes good and is affordable, and change it to something that tastes bad and costs a lot?Had several items, and they're either boring (because it's just raw food) or desperate attempts at making a borderline eating disorder "diet" seem palatable.
3891;Would have rated below one if there were an option ! We made an online reservation and were refused to be seated once we were there. Upon arguing , manager told us to wait for half hour or else SORRY ! We left without dining. Although they have great food but horrible customer service ! If your system allows online booking then pay attention  refusing to seat your clients with reservations is not professional ! Not coming back & not recommending to anyone!
3892;Called for reservation, owner picks up doesn't know how to speak and take reservations as his phone etiquettes needs to be polished, only after an back and forth with me, did he finally apologize and basically insulted me with backhanded compliment. Big no to this place kindly work on your service. One star for at least PICKING up your phone.
3893;Horrible Food and Mediocre Service is what I can say to describe my most recent experience after visiting The Maharaja. I am truly disappointed at the food I had during my visit. Gone were the days where the food here was nothing short of amazing and seeing how far down the service has gone is saddening also. During my visit I had the Dum Biryanni and Chicken Tikka Masala (It goes by another name, but I forgot the name). Had you asked me previously, I would've told you to try it regardless of the price since the taste is so worth it. Now I would say to stay away from this place as the food they produce is not worth it at all! While the service is still "good" for an Indian restaurant, it is nothing like what it used to by initially. While the staff is trained very well with the menu offerings, the "finesse" that you'd expect from an upscale restaurant isn't present at all anymore. Needless to say I would sadly have to recommend to skip this place if you're looking for a good Indian spot.
3894;Ordered their lunch/merienda menu for the day:  adobo buns with salsa on the side ($12).Very small space/seating, hence, the line-up...bordering on hype.It is Filipino-fusion.  Expensive, of course, the rent on Queen St W is expensive too.  Taste-wise, not mémorable, yet authentic.All presententation/drama....but no substance.
3895;Normally i would give this place a minimum 4 stars, but i was recently disappointed by my recent brunch visit as their service and professionalism didn't meet expectations. We made a reservation for 11am for our brunch meal, arrived well before our seating time and waited till 11:20 for the restaurant to even OPEN before we finally decided to just leave. I know it's not a critique of their food which, on a more positive note, is normally very good. I'm just upset over it and needed to express my experience. We called the restaurant several times while waiting and even replied to their confirmation text earlier that morning. Big disappointment, enough to keep us away for awhile. They really defined true "Filipino time".
3896;FOOD: PRO: Good presentation of food. Since they have a bar here, you can order the famous San Miguel Beer from Philippines.CON: Food tastes ordinary. PRICE:CON: It's expensive and you won't get the value from what you paid for.AMBIANCE:PRO: They have a bar and kinda a romantic vibe at night coz you get to have a candlelight dinner.CON: Small space, too tight. SERVICE:CON: OMG they're by far the slowest! You wait for like 30 to 45 minutes for them to serve your food during peak hours.
3897;I was reading great reviews online and thought of trying this place out on our next trip to toronto. Filipino food is not expensive, cooked from the heart like how mom always does it and very tasty. This restaurant did not deliver though :(It was a tuesday and we had 2 choices - get the tuesday 5 course prefixe for $30 per head or get the tasting menu for $80. It was our first time so we opted to get the prefixe set.1st course - pandesal with cheese/butter/sugar - good but small portions. was ok..2nd course - sisig with egg and rice - sisig tasted like canned tuna/chicken chunks with no flavor at all. egg was overcooked, not runny and did not blend with sisig well. rice was in a seperate container - nothing special about it. I was dying to get some knorr or Maggi seasoning but i only got patis from the server. 2nd course (alt) - pancit - my wife did not get her 2nd course till after 15mins - we were done with our sisig. it was really bland and not good. worst pancit i have tasted - it wont even compar
3898;We came here due to a recommendation from a friend but ended up very disappointed. The appetizers didn't take very long to serve, but we had to wait over 40 minutes for the first entrees to come. We were getting irritated by the time the first entree came, and just when we thought our wait was over, the 2nd and 3rd entrees took another 25 to 30 minutes to arrive. The quality of the food did not fail to disappoint further.The servings were puny and did not taste very good. We were advised at the beginning by the server that the entrees were meant to be shared, but they arrived in sizes not nearly enough to satisfy a single person. The food tasted bland and every dish had tons of cilantro for some reason.The restaurant was also not well maintained and the washroom was dirty and smelled very bad. There was a pungent stink of urine as I went down the stairs towards their bathroom.For a party of 3, we ordered 4 appetizers, 3 mains, and 3 sides of rice. We ended up paying a whopping $50 each person. I've been
3899;I went on a Wednesday night around 7 pm the restaurant was less than half full. I was able to get a table for one without a reservation. After sitting down,  I waited for more than 15 minutes with my menu and water with no service. Yes, my menu was on the table thus I was ready to order. I was really looking forward to trying the crispy pata. Everyone else was being served or were eating even a table that arrive after me. Upon reading more reviews, this place is very hit or miss. The service is hit or miss. The food is hit or miss. I know this isn't a critique of their food but you need service to get food. Most Filipinos are very warm and friendly thus they typically make excellent host. So really, this may not be the place for you unless you're felling lucky that night. Not sure if I will go back since I am a out-of-town business traveler and Toronto has so much to offer.
3900;"SOUR" tobiko and smells sour too! On top of dragon roll = it's our taste... Fine! That's their explains toon. I don't like the tobiko at this restaurant
3901;Horrible!  Sushi tastes bad.  Prices are crazy high for what you get!  May be the worst sushi I've had!  Now my husband and I are terrified we may get sick before the night is through!
3902;Food was alright, the portions were tiny.Spent money I would've spent at an AYCE without feeling satisfied/full at all... my friends and I walked nearby for some snacks after.Also, service by the girls were so sweet and nice! Then the dude who served us last was, frankly, really rude. It almost ruined the experience for me :\
3903;I don't care how good your food is, what horrible service! I made reservations at 8, when I walked in, the waitresses totally ignored me for half an hour before giving me a table as if I was begging them!!! It'll be greatly appreciated if they can at least so hi to acknowledge my presence! The three of us stood there like idiots before hearing my name as we got assigned to our spot!! Thank you! I will not come again!
3904;Over priced garbage. This is one of the worst over priced experiences ever. There are way better places like Amadio's in mississauga.  No way I will ever go back to this dump.
3905;Very expensive for something like pizza. Be mindful when adding toppings to the pizza as this substantially increases the price. I was expecting something a lot more special for the price paid. One thing I do appreciate is that they have halal meat options and they make sure there's no cross-contamination with other non-halal meats.
3906;Wow. Rarely does food quality piss me off this much, but I have to share this. Today I ate the WORST, most disgusting, piece of trash ever from Mickey's Pizza in Mississauga. We ordered a WELL DONE, veggie pizza. What I received was a soggy, round flatbread with what I can only describe as cardboard tasting vegetables and sauce. The sauce was worse than presidents choice tomato sauce, and the vegetables were rubber. This place was featured on a TV series, I have to ask how much did the owners pay off the producers to be featured? No one could possibly eat this trash and say," wow let me tell the world!"  You guys need to close down immediately, take a 6 month trip to Italy and learn. I am actually furious I ate a bite and put my body through that.
3907;The staff is pretty rude.. pizza is ok.. not that great.. seating area is scarce overall not going back ever again...
3908;This place was great when i first discovered it a couple years back. But I feel the last couple of times I ate here the crust became much thicker .. And the pizza became less stuffed ...the taste is okay... But the service there is horrible ... Received a burnt pizza complained and there resolution was bring it back and we will see and if we feel it's burnt we will then make you another ... WTF??? Took pizza back and yes it's burnt ( no apology) so I asked for my money back and was it was practically thrown at me ... I also was asked not to waste there time ( I've been hungry now for more than an hour , cause you burnt my pizza!!!) ... It's been a year I just felt the need to review ...
3909;100% sure they forgot the sauce IN our deep dish. It was just cheese and meat with a token drizzle of sauce on top. Granted the crust itself is way too thick to be a Chicago-style deep dish, the lack of sauce was just...I don't know. We visited from downtown Toronto just to try the pizza here (Chicago is too far) and I have to say it was a huge disappointment.
3910;Completely annoyed. My husband and I used to come to Mickeys often but the last few times we promised not to come back. We sometimes come back thinking "if they get it right, its great" key word: if. The last few times there have been issues 1 ) pizza is undercooked and watery. I didnt know pizza could been so soggy. 2) they seem to love to make the wrong size or mess up ingredients. Literally half the time we order, they get it wrong. At first we thought maybe they are busy but no, not the case today, they were nearly empty but stillvmessed it up.  We had to sit and wait another 20 mins. Which happens every time we come here. One time our "pizza exploded in the oven", no one informed us of this until we came to pick it up. Once again we were forced to wait even longer. We only go now for the sauce and only the sauce.
3911;Tonight I went to Mickey's Dragon Pizza boy what a disappointment!!! The women (I guess the owner) talked to me and everyone else as if they never ordered a pie. I asked if should could help me and she wasn't sure since they were only a few doughs left. Make more next time stupid!!! Doughs will last at least a week in the fridge.The pizza crust was lifeless with a painting of tomato sauce that tasted like it was from a bottle of Ragu from the supermarket. I do not think they use herbs of any kind since I did not taste any basil or oregano. The only thing lacking with the pizza was TASTE!!!Please don't waste your money on their awful pizza.Asked for a small container of chili peppers and was told that if I did not get it on the pizza it would cost me 50 cents. WHAT?!?!This place was so bad that I would rather have a Pizza Pizza or 2 4 1 pizza.If and when the owners / servers might, but should not, be precocious, arrogant and  rude is if they truly make a world changing great pizza other wise shut u
3912;After reading all the positive reviews and seeing them featured on You gotta eat here, I decided to give this place a try. I have had Chicago Deep Dish Pizza in Chicago and there was a great place in Maple a few years back called Chicago Pizza Kitchen. I was expecting Chicago Deep Dish Pizza but got a pan pizza at best. The pizza was cooked in 15 minutes which is not the way Deep Dish is cooked, authentic takes at least 40 minutes. The pizza was so doughy in the middle and raw. It was not crispy at all and it barely had any toppings even though I ordered 2 toppings and paid extra. The sauce which is a critical piece to the Chicago Deep Dish was tasteless and had the texture of a can of Tomato Paste. I also ordered the thin crust pizza which was laughable, you are better off buying frozen Pizza at Walmart which tastes better. Overall, this is not authentic Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. I would say Pizza Hut Pan Pizza is way better than this. I won't be returning to this place. Don't believe all the hype.
3913;Not authentic at all..... NOT AT ALL Khao Soi ..... Not sure who paid all these reviewers to call it "authentic" ... I am a HUGE fan of Thai food and have NEVER had coleslaw ... Yes that's right ... Literally COLESLAW in the Khao Soi. It is disgusting. Beef was not tenderized and undercooked.  Tom Yum - the only average thing worth maybe trying if there is nothing else open and you need food. It is heavy on the lemon grass and is missing the fundamental herbs and spices.... For starters galangal .... Had no freshness to the soup .... Tasted like over cooked boiled veggies that had some paste added  choice of meat and severed.  Curry is not authentic at all .... It is a pre-made paste added again to something cooked separate.... Then served. A paste at a Resturant considered to be authentic should be made in house and better quality.Service was fast. Servers were fine. Music was fine. Overall poor quality food.... Will not be coming back and DO NOT recommend this place to anyone.
3914;Disappointing.I ordered the Pad Thai, gaeng kiew whan, gaeng masaman, and pepper and garlic shrimp from the Victoria park location, and it was horrible. The gaeng kiew whan and gaeng masaman was extremely watery, with minimal flavour and no spice. It was not creamy, and did not taste very good. The shrimp with pepper and garlic vegetables was rotten/spoiled and as a result they were too soft, smelled strange, and had the texture of vomit. I hoped that the pad Thai would redeem the Jatujak name, however it was a disappointment as well. Like the curry, it was not creamy and did not taste like street styled Thai food. I could not taste or see tamarind in the pad Thai, which is supposed to make is authentic pad Thai.The chef at this location needs to follow the recipes provided by Jatujak and management needs to buy fresh food. I suggest visiting the Kingston location as the food is a big step up from this one. Meals at the Jatujak on Kingston is amazing, and I will continue going there, but I will always avo
3915;My family and I came here for a Mother's Day dinner. Now while I get take out here a few times a year and absolutely love their curry, I can tell you that this one experience has put me off from ever eating here again. Firstly, after speaking to an employee for a table for 4 and asking for an approximate wait time we were forgotten.  I could forgive this as it was quite busy when we went. Secondly, it took quite some effort to flag down a waiter to order. We spoke to three waitresses before being served. Again, it was quite busy and the staff looked very frazzled, I could forgive this. Lastly, while our appetizers and two main dishes came out very quickly, the remaining two main dishes for my mother and myself were forgotten.  We kept waiting and waiting until it had been half an hour since the other two members of our party received their main dishes. When we asked about it I found out that they had forgotten our order and asked us again what we ordered. We received no apology and I had to ask multiple
3916;Extremely overrated. Came here for authentic thai and rave reviews big dissapointment. dishes are ridiculously small and very stingy with meat even though you pay extra for it! Curries were alright everything else including the tea way too sweet. Pics of the place are misleading as well as the place is a dump(lack of pride or maintenance) and to top it off stomach did not sit well after our meal.. Never again.
3917;I'm so disappointed with this place. I feel so scammed by the reviews on Yelp that made me come to this restaurant. I realized that nowadays our society is filled with people who title themselves as "foodies" but all they do is take photos of the food and deceiving people with reviews without properly tasting them. I ordered the duck wings and lamb sirloin. The duck wings were fine but honestly nothing special. The lamb was the most disappointing dish. Not to mention that it was recommended by our waitress as one of their top dishes. The lamb was cold, favor less and unappetizing. My BF had pork and pancakes. The pork literally just takes like cha Chang tang cha siu with green onions on top. If I wanted cha siu, I would not come here for it. Don't be fooled by the good ratings. I'm sure they're either fake or "foodies" attempting to fool you with highly filtered photos.One last thing I forgot to mention. There was a chinese guy wearing glasses who literally ruined my mood by just looking at his face. He
3918;Great location and concept,  but very dissapointed at their food and service! We went there for a birthday celebration and the service was terrible! We waited for more than an hour for our food,  only with half our appetizers being served and they burnt the brussel sprouts.  Waited another 30 mins for our mains which only half the people got. The octopus was overcooked and rubbery while the seasoning was spotty on the pancake and pork was dried. Not once did the server came by for a quality check and after all the mains came out and almost finished,  we told them we're still missing two orders of bone marrow.  Needless to say,  they've dropped the order,  so they put that on the house.  Took another 30 mins for the server to figure out and print our bills,  in which couple of them were wrong,  so she went back and forth at least 5 times to re-print.  Not interested in going back at all.
3919;Overhyped restaurant serving mediocre food with little depth, on a side of customer service that says "we don't give a **** about you".First off, super excited about brunching here: good yelp reviews, personal recommendations, I love Smash...should be promising? NOPE! Booked a table, got here early, hostess told me to sit at the front while my table "gets ready", but I waited and waited...no one had any intention to seat me when there are an abundance of reserved tables all set and ready to go. I asked 5mins after my supposed reservation time and was immediately seated at those same unoccupied tables. My friends were running late, but no one bothered to ask if I wanted a drink or anything you'd expect as proper service. I wanted to get something warm, requested for someone and they rolled their eyes at me, had no clue what tea was available. After I ordered, 3 different people came by to checked if I did order something but none of them ended up bringing anything.When everyone got here, took forever for th
3920;This place is definitely overrated and overhyped,  especially by the millennial, East-Asian demographic that populate the surrounding city of Markham.Food: 2.5 (out of 5)Service: 0Setting: 2Overall: 1.5 SERVICE:Let's start with the main reason why this place left such a disappointing and bad taste in our mouths: BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. It honestly does not matter to me if the food tastes heavenly and is at a Michelin-star level (which it did not, in this case), if a restaurant cannot even get the basics of customer service right. I mean, when you dine out at a restaurant, you are not simply there to enjoy the food it is an entire package that you are paying for. They don't call it the hospitality industry for nothing.Upon arrival, I was greeted by three different hosts at the same time, and felt a bit ambushed as all three were talking to me at the same time. I arrived at 7:05pm for our reservation at 7:00pm. I found my friend who was already sitting and waiting by the front, and joined her, but ne
3921;Made a reservation well in advance and when we got to the restaurant there was no table for us. They tried to put a table in th middle of the walking area right in front of the door in the middle of winter. Not impressed. They said that was the best they could do. We left.
3922;The food is really delicious, but the service is very bad, the waiter is disrespectful. And if you complain about bad service, they do not care. I'm not going to come back ever.
3923;Where do I begin... The moment my friends and I sat down we were asked, "so boys and girls, did you guys just finish your last day of school?" We genuinely thought she was joking until she went on about it. It was definitely not a professional way to treat your clientele, even if we age well for our age.  When we ordered, I clearly ordered the roasted chicken but when the orders came she claimed that I ordered the other chicken dish. I wouldn't be as upset if she kept insisting I ordered the chicken dish and kept redirecting the blame to my colleague beside me when I pointed to what I wanted and read the dish name TWO TIMES IN BOTH LANGUAGES ON THE MENU. The staff offered a very low level of integrity throughout the service. After we all paid (with the 15% tip they slap on top), they were badgering us and harassing us about whether we paid or not. The chicken dish that I accepted in the end was okay. However my friends who ordered the boneless steak dish found their meat to tough, dry and rather bland. Th
3924;I've given this restaurant 3 chances and they failed each time. Each time we would go, us and every table around us would be complaining about bad service and badly executed dishes. I took the owner aside and calmly said why we wouldn't be paying for our awful meal which was 45 mins late and undercooked and she told us off. That's why restaurants go out of business. So sad. I really wish she would listen.
3925;Someone!Call the old owners!Another one has just bit the dust in my list. Do you remember the old owners and the friendly staff? It was one amazing place with an exceptional customer service and people who wanted to make it right. The food was so delicious but mostly we came for both- their people skills and great menu.The new owner has a funny way to deal with problems- to hide. Never called me back. I am not that important after all, I understand, whatever your name is, the ghostmanInstead of friendly skilled girls waitresses we had ,now you have this little young moody thing at the counter who will get even with you if you dare to upset his inattentive unprofessional and unpleasant existence. He'll let you know he's upset by shoveling the dishes, talking back or not saying hello if you tell him he freaking made a mistake on a huge order and you had to drive back and forth to exchange, while kids were waiting and arguing with you. Do they apologize or offer to rectify it just as the old staff would? You 
3926;We had our last experience here recently.  I've noted that the food was to be missed but we got together and I didn't have a chance to eat before arriving.  I decided to be a bit brave and order the gnocchi and regretted it immediately on trying it.  It wasn't eatable.  I had two other people try it and they agreed.  I had never sent anything back before in my life. That isn't hyperbole, I haven't.  Usually I just suck it up but I was starving and massively disappointed.  The waitress was really good about it and disappeared with the dish and a new order (a much safer fish and chips).  After about 5 minutes a woman came and asked gruffly what was wrong with the dish.  I explained that it wasn't eatable and apologized but I was hungry and didn't want to eat it.  She pressed the point - asked what specifically was wrong with it.  I said it lacked flavour and was too mushy (I was being polite, it had the consistency of gummy glue).  She, is a profoundly condescending tone, explained that this is what gnocci is a
3927;The limited menu felt stale and the high ratings seem grossly undeserved. We went with a group menu after our server assured us that the kitchen could accommodate any and all food allergies. One member of our party was lactose intolerant - an issue that seemed completely new to both the server and the kitchen. Even after a detailed conversation about lactose intolerance - as dishes from the group menu arrived, one after another contained cheese/milk/cream or  sauces were completely omitted. This led to uncomfortable moments, including one course where our friend was told to eat off the far edge of a shared plate. Other courses he missed out entirely. Drinks didn't come out in a timely manner. No attempt was made by the staff to address major service flaws even after they were brought to the restaurant's attention. Very disappointing.
3928;This is not Indian chaat - it's downright abysmal! Also, my god!! The sheer amount of plastic that is used at this place is frightening - wish they cared about the environment a bit more!
3929;The service is HORRIBLE! It has been 2 hours since I ordered my food and it is still not here. It literally takes less than 20 minutes to get from the place to my home, and I called the restaurant 30 mins ago, and they said that the driver was on his way... STILL NOT HERE. I really hope that at least the food tastes good... if it ever gets here.
3930;Very disappointed to be turned away from this place during the raptors playoffs. I understand they would like to maximize their space however for a table of 2 they wanted us to sit at the bar although half their restaurant was still empty. I rave about their food however at this time this was very disappointing to be treated like this. I hope the owner/manager does read this review and take it under their advisement to either provide tables that seat two as not every one will come in as a group of 4
3931;Terrible experience!!! Didn't honour their reservation. The manager said he seated people "an hour earlier at our table and couldn't kick them out". I made a reservation 8 hours earlier. They didn't apologize, didn't even offer a seat at the bar while we waited. We were very excited to watch the Raptors game. After waiting for 20 minutes we asked him again why we were standing by the doors when we made a reservation and again he said he couldn't kick people out he gave our table to an hour earlier. At that point we left. Don't expect your reservation to be honoured here if you're planning to watch a game you're looking forward to. I've never seen this happen before. He didn't apologize once. We figured out while watching the servers talking amongst themselves that they booked way more people than they had tables for. The manager actually had the audacity to say "your reservation was at 7:30, if you came at 7:15 you would have had the table." So rude, so unprofessional.
3932;If I could put 0 stars I would since I was very disappointed with the way I was treated when coming In for an early dinner to catch the game. Called 30 mins in advance to confirm if there are seats available, hostess advised that there is no wait for seats in the restaurant. Upon arrival I was told that me and my girlfriend couldn't get a booth seat because they wanted to reserve those seats for groups of 4 and that they had no other choice but to seat us at the bar, which is ridiculous seeing as the restaurant was practically empty when we got there. We came here many times before and had an overall good experience with food and their staff, but because of this, I will never come back, comes to show that the owner wants to prioritize making as much $$$.
3933;I ordered a latte and a scone to go. The latte was ok, but the scone was raw inside. I called to let them know their scones weren't cooked properly and the employee didn't apologize or offer to replace it, he just said "ok, I'll let the owner know" I think if you sell uncooked raw baked goods, you should at least offer to replace it. It's basic customer service. I won't be going back.
3934;Straight up, the worst cafe to go to in Toronto. I've been to a lot, just your average Torontonian, we love the coffee scene. But if you want to go to an anti-Toronto place, this is the place! Terrible weird decor, a mix of an out of place cowboy vibe and out of date fonts. The owners have created a place of fear. You can see it in the timidity of the staff, and the general way they lack creativity. The owners are old has beens stuck in a time warp. Places were run differently 30 years ago, and thank F times have changed! Not here though. Their fear regime spreads to the customers too - these tyrants have kicked people out for using their wifi, plugging in laptops, and not dressing appropriately (whatever that means, not cowboy enough?). Country hicks trying to run a Toronto shop. Toronto is dominated by quality espresso shops with easy going and collaborative vibes. This place has only survived because of the CN Tower tourist trap, other than that it's a dead zone.
3935;I had a hankering for sushi this past Sunday.  I've been on a hamachi obsession lately. I found this restaurant from another review site where reviewers gave it such high marks.This place had negi toro and negi hamachi makis so I ordered them. Generally, most places can't really go wrong with this unless the fish quality is terrible.When I was given the rolls, the rolls looked like it vomited in itself.  The fish was chopped up with the onion and had a very gelatinous and bubbly quality to them, spilling from the center of each piece.  It really looked like a clear phlegm with fish bits and green onion.I ate 3 pieces but gave up.  I couldn't stomach eating it.  The rice quality was terrible to boot.
3936;Service is friendly but slow. I heard they have changed management and the food was pretty disappointing.  The skimpiest sushi portions and presentation was not appealing. It's a shame as they were one of my regular go to places.
3937;The one older lady there is so cheap and ignorant. She never gives good pieces, every time I go there, I always robbed. A Large Jerk Chicken is usually $12.something and last time I went, she charged me $14.00 on the dot. Absurd. Attached picture for proof.
3938;Despite all of the great reviews of this place, I unfortunately cannot give them a good review for one simple reason:  eggs...barely...cooked.  Both my Wife and I had the breakfast special and asked for the eggs over MEDIUM.  I even stressed "not too runny"  Well, not only were the yolks uncooked, but most of the egg white was runny and gluey - GROSS.  In my opinion, if you cannot follow orders on how the customer wants their eggs cooked, you are not worthy of a return visit.  Too bad, having to line up had my hopes up.   Never again.
3939;Really really disappointed with my experience. I was charged $1.50 extra to add mayo to a bacon egg and cheese sandwich. The waitress said she had to charge extra as mayo didnt go with that sandwich. I had  been many times before and raved about the place. The pettiness and surcharge really turned me off. I doubt I'll go back. All over a dollar fifty. As a customer I expect better .
3940;Great little place   went in the other day and  look great  didnt try  the food yet  but gonna try soon....
3941;One of the worst burritos I have had so far. The veggies were cold, taste wasnt good either. Tortilla was uncooked, I felt like eating uncooked wheat, felt like gum in my mouth.I would not go there again.
3942;Came here after a close friend recommended this place. Was even considering having my son's baptism, based on my friend's referral. Thank God my husband and I decided to come for date night, because after our experience at this restaurant we will never ever come back, and will not be having our son's baptism here. The service was pathetic, and the food was a let down. There are so many other italian restaurants in the area with exceptional food. The only positive experience that came out of going was the fact that we know never ever to host an event here.
3943;After having read all the solid reviews, i have to say we were disappointed by rendezvous. my wife had the vegetarian platter, which was fine (altho i think the platter at Lalibela was a cut above). I had the doro wat (spicy chicken). While the dish tasted fine, there was only a single drumstick with the sauce and a soft-boiled egg, which was almost comical at $11.50. The really disappointing aspect was the lack of professional service. Although our server was pleasant, we never really saw her after we were served. Our water glasses were never refilled and my wife had to flag down another server to get more hot water for tea. It also took nearly 20 minutes to get the check, which no one ever picked up (we eventually paid at the register after another 15 minutes).I certainly don't expect fine dining when i get Ethiopian food, but this was pretty disappointing from start to finish. If you value service and want to try Ethiopian, i'd have to suggest going across the street to Lalibela.
3944;This place has gone downhill. It used to me one of my favourite Ethiopian restaurants. Now the food is blunt, old, cold, no longer tasty. The service is about the same, if you ask for the salad on the side, it won't happen.
3945;I had a Groupon to try this place out. The perogies were just ok and the atmosphere is a bar. Went on a Friday night at peak dinner time and didn't need to wait to be seated (first warning). I had the mushroom which tasted ok. My husband had pulled pork which he said was weak. A dessert was thrown in and we had strawberry and chocolate. It was a hideous dessert almost not edible. Everything tasted very processed, like a fast food joint. It reminded us of a Fancy Frank's for perogies. I dislike fast food, so unless that's what you are expecting, I would stay away. The regular prices are steep for the quality of food. My husband felt hungry after the dinner portion but there was nothing else on the menu to buy - no app options. I am surprised at all the good reviews for this place. I hoped it would be a lot better and will not be going back.
3946;Tried new Gerrard location. Was looking forward to it. Stupidly didn't ask what the filling was, assumed it was cheese or potato. Turns out they are all made with potato and onion. A lot of onion. I had asked for no chopped onions on my order, that would be the servers first clue, the dish came with very undercooked carmelized onions, i picked them all off, there were a lot. I told him i was allergic to uncooked or under cooked onion, he offered to cook the picked off onions until they were crispy. I said no thanks its ok, clue number two, i actually said out loud that I was allergic to raw or uncooked onions. This might have been the moment to explain that the pierogis contained onion. Nope! The filling ingredients are not listed on the menu. After eating one I realized the joint error. Server awkwardly apologized, told me i would get a discount. He brought me the bill. Very weird that I was charged at all, even weirder that he didn't ask me if i would be okay. Hopefully this can be chalked up to a comedy o
3947;Came to the restaurant to find that it was closed without a sign or message stating why. Stop by on a Thursday at 645 pm. Called the alternate location and they didn't even know it was closed... so confused and disappointed
3948;Mass produced pierogi that were freezer burned and dry. You would think that the toppings would help moisten them but no such luck.
3949;I ordered from Loaded Pierogi off Uber Eats, a $13 dish and it came with 4 un-cooked pierogies. Raw dough. DISGUSTING! What kind of service is this? There are 8 maybe 9 pierogis and half are uncooked? How do you even do that?Very disappointing, will not be recommending this to anyone.
3950;Unhappy servers, overpriced food with long wait times. Can't really comment on food quality - gave up on my SALAD after half an hour- paid my drink tab and left.
3951;A friend of mine and myself drifted in to the landing one afternoon and noticed a strong smell of burning rubber? We mentioned it to the server behind the bar, and she said "Yea, I know, several people have mentioned this, and we have mentioned it to the owner, he won't do anything"Enough said.
3952;The food may be very good but the service here sucks big time. Twice I have picked out a bunch of groceries and carried them to the counter only to have the girls behind he counter full out ignore me and ask the other customers to come up to be cashed out. At first I thought I was imagining this so I waited a bit until one woman who was behind me was aske to come up to be cashed out and I was still there holding my items. I placed all the my things down and left the bakery. The next time the same thing happened only this time I slammed the things down an asked them why this was happening. The girls looked at me and then continued to cash out the other customers again. So I yelled again and walked out. Never stepped foot in this place again.
3953;Not sure how anyone can think this is quality.  The deserts have artificial ingredients and taste awful.  The cannoli are among the worst I have tried in Toronto.  Fried shell where you can taste the oil and artificial flavours. Go downtown for quality Italian pastries.
3954;Incredibly slow service for such a small place. About 30 minutes after we ordered, we got our appetizers. The mains came about 30 seconds later. We ordered enchiladas, which were inedible piles of sour cream and cheese on a soggy tortilla, served with three tiny fragments of nachos in a tablespoon of beans. And there was bland rice with frozen vegetables mixed in. We left an excessive tip (the servers were nice, but not exactly attentive) just so we wouldn't have to wait for change.
3955;Went there with my husband and 4 year old daughter at 1:15 pm on a Saturday afternoon.  There was one waitress who was somewhat run off her feet.  We found a clean table and sat ourselves.  She brought over the menus and about 15-20 minutes later she finally took our order - torta, quesadilla, and pambazo.  A very simple order with no substitutions.  We waited for a long time with the understanding that the place was clearly understaffed.  (I used to be a waitress and am more than accommodating when I see a waitress struggling to keep up).  We started to notice that the food orders were also coming out very slowly as there was only one person in the kitchen.  After waiting for an hour (I know this because I had to put more money in the parking meter), I finally said to my husband that if our order doesn't come out next, we're leaving.  The next order that came out was served to a table that was sat after us.  I'd had it by that time.  We were in the restaurant for 1hour & 10 minutes and NO FOOD.  SO VERY DISA
3956;Hand written sign on the front door saying they're closed. Management wasted the time and energy of 5 people. Website says they're open till 10 yelp says 6 and no updates on any of their directories or social media profiles. For shame. Not coming back.
3957;This place is ALWAYS closed, and one time I wanted to have take out because I work near by, and the waiter was rude and told me they don't do take out when they're "busy" and didn't even offer to take my order and tell me to come back in one hour or so. Bad service.
3958;This is the easiest, shortest review I've ever written: good food, cheap decor, and appalling customer service. I'm talking a 10 minute delay to bring you a beer and a 20 minute delay to bring you the bill. Avoid.
3959;My opinion: steer clear. Not sure how they even got above a 1 star review. They sell trash at a premium. You've been warned.
3960;Big time miss!!!! Bought a $13.00 petit Acai Bowl for lunch. The fruit toppings were partially frozen which made it inedible. First and a last, save your money and Calories!!! USE FRESH PRODUCE!!!!
3961;Great customer service till they have your money!!!!!! Five day program for two people and not one day was correct. Three trips to pickup the juices and not once was the order correct or ready. On the last day they gave us another clients juices, worst $500.00 ever spent.Never received a call from a manager, if they even have one, to apologize for the inconvenience. Take your money elsewhere........
3962;Came here to grab breakfast on a Sunday morning Pros- Nice ambiance Cons- Absurdly priced the options that you get- Taste is sub par. Would not recommend
3963;Under every normal circumstance i would have given this bakery a 4 or 5 but as i went in today and asked for a specific product which they refused to sell me because of their "display". Had i gone into any other bakery and asked for a specific cake/cupcake or piece of dessert they would have given to me but the front lady and baker REFUSED and not only that but the baker was condescending and talked down to me as if i were an idiot. Maybe had their not been visual a visual difference i wouldn't have been so picky but as you can see by the picture there was a difference in quality (old versus fresh) I will never step foot in here especially considering i can make this stuff myself at home but didn't want to be bothered making huge batches
3964;I WILL NOT be back.  The server did not include all the items in the box that I paid for.  When I followed up to clarify the concern, they ignored my email.  Very POOR customer service and I am sad that as a long time customer, I was treated with such disregard.  There are many other great bakeries on the Danforth that I would recommend instead of this place.
3965;The server AJ is really rude. Ruined my experience at Miku today!I got the holiday set. The amount of food I get worth the price I pay, even though it was not extraordinary. Would not recommend friends to come here.
3966;The only reason This place got a star  is because of the waiter. He was friendly!Perhaps we didn't order the right things or perhaps we got spoiled by the freshness of everything in LA. We,however, did take the recommendation from our waiter since we are not Locals.-Grilled octopus: $21-- we got 4 small pieces.mediocre - Lobster entree : $59--- boring and not fresh.overall tasteless! - house special seafood soup Boullabasses: tasteless-Shiso Mojito: $14 very bitter and sour- Martini: good-Miyazaki #2: taste like cough medicine. Nasty! Flies in the drink.With the price,we honestly expected better. Food should be better in term  of flavor and freshness.
3967;I've been here once and after ordering a ton of food with my friends, I ordered the uni and was sadly disappointed. The uni was not fresh at all. It was borderline spoiled.My parents went a few months down the line for a special occasion of theirs. They came back to tell me that this place is overrated and overpriced for what it is. Along with the rest of their order, they got oysters. One of the oysters were not edible and my dad had to spit it out as fast as he could but not before some of it was already ingested. The restaurant should definitely make up for this error considering the level of establishment they claim to be. But all they did was replace the 1 oyster. Seriously? My dad came home with food poisoning. The single star goes to the design of the restaurant.
3968;Another resto that baffles me. The reviews are so good but I found everything so disappointing. Style over substance I guess. I wouldn't recommend, just avoid.
3969;Just a pure bad experience. No one cared about us for 15-20 minutes after we sat down. 5 different servers walked past our table without offering anything or looking at us.
3970;I'd give this place and average rating. The food was good but not amazing. I guess I'm comparing this place to Japango which is another sushi restaurant down at Elizabeth and Dundas. I mean if you would have to compare both restaurants, Japango would be a bang for the buck. Japango is a little less expensive but the quality is on point oppose to coming to this place and paying more, you'd expect that the quality of the food would be far more superior. Also, the taste was just okay and nothing too special. The sushi was just subpar and honestly didn't leave a lasting impression on me. I think the reason why this place is hyped is due to its location and the vibe that it tries to give, which is it's suppose to be a high end restaurant and it makes you feel fancy. Ask yourself this, by dressing up and looking fancy does that make the quality and taste of the food any better?  Taste with your mouth and not your eyes.
3971;After reading all the good comments about winterlicious, maybe they were all busy taking care of winterlicious customers because I had a worst experience in miku on sunday. I visited miku after 3pm when they were only serving bar bites menu, I sat down, only few of the aburi menu was served and some apps. I ordered tofu salad with miso dressing and saba, sake, and ebi aburi sushi.Service. TERRIBLE. WORST in high Japanese restaurant. I sat down. The server did not come to take the order until the guy who looked like a floor manager passed by and looked that our menu was closed and try to take the order. She ran into us and said that she is our server so she will be helping us for the day. I got a feeling that she did not want us to talk but to her because its her table. Because it was after lunch winterlicious hour the restaurant was very empty. The food had arrived. Our water glass was empty. But I tried to wait to see our server because I thought that was the manner that she wanted me to follow. Conclusion
3972;We went on a Wednesday evening for the first time.We started with a sharp/grumpy host who seemed upset about the fact we did not make a reservation. "You are not a 3 Michelin star where you have to make a reservation 4 months in advance!" Besides, walk-ins generate new clientele and if they would have done a good job, repeat customers.Not a good start, but we didn't let that bother us.A very nice lady let us choose our seats, gave us the menu and left.We waited and we waited a bit more. No water, no service, no nothing. We were so shocked with the bad service that we decided to leave! We didn't get to try anything! You can have the best food in town, we are not interested if you can't treat your customers properly!
3973;Service was great. The sushi, on the other hand, not so great. I would even go as far to say awful. The omakase was a waste of money. Of the 10 pieces of nigiri, I may have enjoyed 1. After dining at top sushi restaurants like Nakazawa and Morimoto, I had high hopes for this place. But I was only disappointed with the lack of simplicity and lack of distinction of flavors, besides the wasabi which overpowered most other flavors.
3974;The worst food ever. Depended on yelp reviews to go check this place out. It was completely disappointing. Everything seemed to be put together by a disinterested chef. The lady at the counter was most unwelcoming, acting as if she is doing  us a favour by letting us come in. Never again for me!
3975;Arbitrarily decided to close early today. So unfortunately we have review to provide.
3976;I am not sure where all of these great reviews are coming from. I have gone here a couple time and the food is okay, but the portions are small. Also I went here for breakfast once and got the waffles, but they were just eggo's. There is no problem with eggo's, but don't call them waffles if all you are going to serve me is eggo's. Try paradise Cafe which is across the street and has a much better selection.
3977;Terrible selection, very few options at 2 pm.. Only offers halal chicken which I avoid any time possible. Should at the least be optional. Can I add that this makes no sense to serve only halal chicken when almost every sandwich has a pork aspect to it? Prosciutto and halal chicken, absolute genius to come up with this idea Definitely not worth the detour
3978;Came for brunch. Found the prices high for what was offered.  They charged me $15 for eggs and potatoes. The potatoes were delicious but scanty portions (I got 3 and a half baby potatoes with my order). The service was also slow. It took 30 minutes just to take our order and then another 30 minutes to bring our food. This whole time, they didn't come by once to refill coffee. Definately not coming back to this place.
3979;Very poor service....vil never recommend or visit again. I wish I could give zero star to this place.
3980;Went here for dinner for the first time.  We didn't need to wait for our table.  However the waiter wanted to seat us next to the rest room!  Didn't appreciate this because there were many vacant tables!   We had to select our own table that was farther away from the rest room.  The table was not far enough because we can still smell the washroom odour.  We decided to move to another table just to avoid the washroom smell.  However the next table and seat were not clean, it was dirty and sticky.  I wanted to try the fish and chips, regretted the choice the moment it arrived.  It was so disappointing, the fish and the beer batter tasted bland.  The cook need to season the fish and chips.  The beer batter was too thick and the coleslaw portion was the size of a table spoon and way too creamy.  The fries were the only thing on my plate that was good.  My boyfriend ordered the grilled salmon with caesar salad and although the grilled salmon was good, the caesar salad was extremely garlicky.  He felt sick afterwar
3981;Yikes, food is overly greasy, very oily, not tasty, and super expensive.Very loud and cramp inside.The best thing of my meal was the grapefruit juice, but so small, I asked no ice to get better value of my drink.
3982;Went there a few weeks ago on a Thursday night. I called ahead to reserve a table for 2. We were seated at the table and waited and waited for a server to at least acknowledge us. Nothing happened. Both servers walked past our table several times and didn't offer any water or to even say they would be back. After waiting about 15-20 minutes we walked out and went to another near by restaurant.This was our first time trying out this restaurant but after the lack of service we will never come back.
3983;This is my third time visiting this establishment. Each time I've had to wait at least 10 minutes to see a member of the wait staff. Tonite was no different, it was 15 minutes to get my drink order while I noticed that staff are talking to each other. It seems that customer service doesn't appear to be a priority at this establishment. It's too bad because I do think the menu is innovative and interesting.
3984;We got struck in traffic on 401 and we called and spoke to the manager that pls keep our table we r on our way....he shld have told us ur policy then we would have not wasted our time coming all the way to the restaurant.....plus u gave us a table where there was no t.v. It's a sports bar pls get some more t.v. I hope u get our point
3985;Guys...this is quite literally the worst Thai food I have ever had in my life. Please save yourself and order from orchid Thai. There is zero flavor in this food.  We ordered red curry, pad Thai and spring rolls. Spring rolls are pretty delicious but other than that...just don't do it!  If your giving this place a good review, you need to try other Thai places to understand what real Thai food should taste like.
3986;Out dated horrible service food was not as good it was eating at cafeteria best part of the experience was getting the bill and leaving thank goodness I was only stuck in the 80's for 40 min
3987;I decided to go Santo's for Mothers Day Dinner. My expectations were high but I left disappointed. I understand that was hectic  due to Mothers Day...but that doesn't  excuse the bad service and below  average  food for the price we paid.
3988;The food here is solid for those late night grabs with buddies. However customer service was among the worst I've had. I understand since they are open late they must deal with a lot of annoying, drunk customers so maybe they're on edge. But I was with my family, being polite and the men making the food were extremely rude. It's a shame that since they have a steady flow of customers they decide they can be pricks, knowing they still make their money.I didn't expect service like I'm at The Keg, but it was pretty ridiculous how they treat their customers. I've never been back and probably won't.
3989;Yes the portions are big and they have a diverse menu. I've had their chicken souvlaki dinner and chicken on a pita, and their meat is very dry. I noticed that when I looked over the counter, they had already cooked the meats, and they just reheat it on the grill, that's why it doesn't take a long time. People have better standards for yourself, you're so easily fooled by the portions they throw at you you can't realise that the quality is shit, and it's not like it's dirt cheap either. The pita sandwich was $8+tax, and that's how much it'll cost at a lot of places. Also, the chicken souvlaki, is just grilled chicken breast...it's not souvlaki style...you can't add tzatziki  and say it's Greek. DON'T PRECOOK YOUR MEAT AND YOU'LL BE GREAT!
3990;Fast food style, expensive, terrible ambiance. Don't let the price fool you into thinking it is a good place to go.
3991;Do you like big portions? Do like pre cooked food? How about only paying cash? Or even zero hand washing while handling your food??? Well then this place is for you. Me and my husband went here hoping to find something amazing because of all the great reviews. Let's be honest everyone.. This is not that great. I wonder how many people have gotten sick from this place? It's really sad that a restaurant that's so very successful couldn't invest in a debit machine but would rather invest in subpar food/cleanliness. Well all these things will catch up to them as its only a matter of time. Please be advised sometimes things are what I they seem. If it looks rank it probably is. The reason for one star is because of shear obligation and manners.
3992;Late night disappointment: had the cheese burger and fries and was expecting home cut fries and a tasty burger worth the calories but instead got frozen fries and a bland pre cooked burger. I provably should have stayed with the Greek dishes in this popular restaurant.
3993;Tasty food but as for the respect of first time customer...HORRIBLE! Careful how you pay if using US currency . Cash only so I only had US currency and asked if they accept US, the lady behind the counter said yes we do. First of all...informing the lady this was our first time here and saw it had great reviews ... what do you suggest?  She point at the first plate that was just made for the person in front of us. I asked what that was and she pointed up at the menu and said " That " . Ok... lol , thinking to myself couldn't of been a little more personable and explaining rather than saying nothing and pointing.  Moving on... after ordering my total came to $51.00 CAN ... I gave her $40 US and she asked for more...thinking in my head that's close so I gave her another $20 because that's all I had . She gave me back $14 CAN . In my head I knew it wasn't right and decided to look into it while eating . Caculated it out and they owed me approx $28 CAN back, another $14 CAN  ... kindly waited in the long line ,
3994;So confused why this place has good reviews, has no flavour, you can only pay cash and the meals are expensive. I would only recommend only if you close by and nothing else is open.
3995;Are you kidding, I'm sorry but what kind of taste do people have in this forum. Four stars? There's something really wrong here.  This place is a garbage hole. What a bunch of tasteless, overly greasy, overly fat saturated food. Poorly cooked and it wasn't even busy. Just came back from this place,  my wife and I were really hungry spent $26 for two burgers, fries and drinks. I could have grabbed the fries and wrung the grease out. Here's a hint for the cooks, your frying oil needs to be hot so that fries aren't greasy tasting and crisp. Additionally your food needs flavour. Learn how to spice up your food to bring out the flavour. We were so disgusted that we left most of the meal there. It's seems most of what people like about this place are the quantities. Not good enough , give me some real food with FLAVOUR and less GREASE!
3996;I have been ordering from Thai Signature for years. Prior to about 6 months ago I would have said it was one of the 5 best Thai restaurants I've tried. Unfortunately they seem to have undergone some changes, and after several very bad orders I'm moving on - goodbye old friend.Today while ordering three dishes I said the words "very spicy" 5 times. I felt like it was overkill, but based on recent experience I thought better overkill than bland food. My pad thai was about as spicy as ketchup, basil eggplant wasn't much better, and I could detect a hint of heat (2 on a 5 scale rating at other restaurants) in the curry. The curry used to come with chunks of fresh thai chili. Now I could see maybe 3 flecks of a jarred red chili paste.Funny thing is, when I called to tell them this, I got met with an elaborate argument about how customers don't like when it's spicy and that's as spicy as they can make it... Great customer service huh? Then when I said the pad thai tasted like ketchup he said, oh yeah they didn'
3997;Beware when ordering takeout!!! If they miss something in your order here it is your problem to chase them down for it. Which in my experience included multiple calls and being hung up on by a manager. The food was good but an extremely disappointing customer service experience would make me very wary to return.
3998;Let me start by saying we have been to Thai Signature for dinner numerous times, and have left satisfied and happy. Unfortunately the last time was a very different experience. We went for a late lunch around 2:15. We quickly ordered. I ordered shrimp pad Thai, my sister the chicken green curry which were both off of their lunch special menu. My niece ordered pineapple fried rice which was not apart of their lunch special. The food came out quickly. My pad thai was fine. A little on the greasy side but still good. My niece's pineapple fried rice was weird looking. First off it was green!! We have never eaten pineapple fried rice that had a green colour to it. But we tried it. It wasn't terrible. Just not what we were used to. So we didn't complain. Now my sisters green curry on the other hand was hardly eaten. She told me to try it. All I could taste was salt!!! Like instead of a pinch they poured half a bottle. We told the waitress that the curry is not ediable. She took it back to the kitchen, and returned 
3999;This place is the worst. We ordered $15 of jerk chicken and rice and another order of stewed chicken and rice for $12 and we went to pick it up.  We paid and came home  and there was no jerk chicken in the container just filled with rice. This place is not worth  it. Completely shitty service.
4000;Came in to try the Jerk chicken. Wasn't able to as I was told I had to wait, as a large order was being prepared. Why would I wait for you to complete a catering order when you could easily prepare 1 meal, have me pay, then I leave? What if the place was packed? What would you guys do? You'd be screwed. Then you tell me 5 minutes later you might be out of Jerk chicken after this order. Wtf? The customer service is always sub par in Carribean restaurants across the GTA. Do better.
4001;Really wasn't a fan of it.The chicken tasted like gasoline. Almost as if the fire wasn't strong enough, so they threw lighter fluid on it to kick up the flames. Threw it out after a few bites. Add to it, food was served cold.The festivals tasted as if they had been sitting there for a few days.While I understand UberEats has paired with the company, and the company is often well-reviewed, this was among the worst places I've been for Jerk Chicken in quite a long time.
4002;Been here a few times over the years..Interior looks better .I'm not a big fan of cold food. Makes u wonder how long it's been sitting. Plus over 11 bucks for medium sized dinner?! I'll go somewhere else next time. Plus it's winter, cold outside and inside. Some poor kid at the cash with a HACKING cough, bad experience at RAPS.
4003;So we always go to Raps to get our jerk chicken when we are craving it. We went tonight and saw that the drum pan was not lit up and figured they jerked and had it all inside. When we wine inside the main server wasn't there and won't be back till March so they have substitutes.  We realized that these substitutes do not know how to cook or jerk chicken. The jerk chicken was sitting in a tray over hot water to keep warm. I had a feeling it wouldn't be good but I hoped I was wrong. I was right we bought a large jerk chicken with rice and oxtail gravy. The jerk chicken had no smokey flavor it was cold and wasn't cooked fully. The gravy on the oxtail tasted bad ad was salty. Needless to say we did not eat much of it and now we are sitting wondering where to go given that it is Christmas Eve and nothing is open. My advice to anyone who wants to go here is to wait until April to go when the main guy is back because that seems to be the only way to get good jerk chicken unless you want to try the other restaurants 
4004;Server is rude and not paying attention. Have to come back and verified our orders.  Salmon is over-cooked and dried.  Menus are overpriced for the quality of food.  However, the steak was done perfectly to medium.
4005;Well I took trip to valley fields today as I read great reviews. Dinner was alright . Breakfast was good but as I finished my my meal the server came over and asked if we wanted dessert so I ordered bread pudding with rum sauce, as I get half way threw a notice something sticking out the edge so to my surprise I find the bread tag baked into the pudding. So the manager comes an said sorry its cuz we used real bread and he still charged us for the dessert. I have to say not impressed and will not ever go back.........
4006;Came here with the family on Sunday for brunch. I was unimpressed by the service. People came in after us and got a seat before us because they seemed familiar with the hostess or owner. We ended up waiting another 10 minutes for a seat to open up since the place was packed. The people sitting beside us came after us and were asked about their orders first. We had to wait another 5 minutes before we could order.The food was mediocre. We will not be back.
4007;Ok so imagine that is Halloween all year around, that's the deco inside the place ... the service is great... their Caesar mix and the food not so much, we didn't returned the food because the cook is right besides de bar haha we didn't want to make her feel bad but the food was horrible :( we pretended to be really full and then shoot two shots of Jameson because we felt we were going to be sick ... I really wanted to like this place but we are not coming back eveerrrr
4008;A friend and I travelled from the east end to go for a bite to eat. Our initial thoughts were this was a cute dive bar. The initial server was funny and served drinks right away. She gave up and never came back. She left. Then a guy took over bartending. We asked for a menu. 45 minutes later no offer of drinks or food. We actually persisted thinking this was funny but it eventually enraged us. We paid the bill and left. Maybe we didn't have enough facial hair for this hipster crowd of 4 or 5. Dear manager, train your staff to acknowledge their customers (keep off their cell phones, don't just focus on the 3 regulars who walked up to the bar to order drinks). Honestly, I would consider going back and giving the food a try if you just said you had a meeting with your staff. We were 3 feet away from the bartender and he didn't even look over.
4009;THE LEAST INCLUSIVE BAR.  My friends and I were visiting and were mistreated by the bartender. We were visitors in town that were told of this amazing bar and were shockingly disappointed by the service and overall defensive attention brought to us. Lack of professionalism and common courtesy should shy people that expect a safe and warm environment.
4010;Thought I would try this place since it was Friday and didn't want to drive to olde York on Laird.  Oh boy do I wish I did.  Ordered haddock and chips $7.50. Very reasonable price.  But the fish was non existent under a 1 inch of greasy mushy no flavour batter.  The chips were cutthick not crispy and undercooked. The lot went in the garbage.  Complete let down.
4011;This place is right in our neighbourhood and a few years back it was a great treat to order from here. Tonight was our second bad experience in a row. Last time we ordered I am certain we were given cod, not the halibut we ordered. I called and the owner insisted this was not the case. Tonight we went there to pick up our order and we didn't realize until we got home, but it was the wrong order. We called and they said just keep the order ( there was more food than we had ordered ) as if they were doing us a favour. They had charged us for this expanded order!  I didn't want $40 worth of food. So we walked back and picked up our order. The fries were definitely not fresh. The fish was greasy.  And there was no recompense for their error. So we are done with thus place. Quality has decreased. Clearly the service is suffering. I can find better ways to spend our take-out budget.
4012;How hard is it to find decent Thai food in Durham? Impossible it seems. We ordered Tom Yum Noodle Soup, Chicken and Shrimp Pad Thai, and Red Curry and Lychee with Fish. They said it would be 45 minutes for delivery. 60 minutes pass and still no food. When I called, I was told that their driver never showed up and they needed to call someone else in. They apologized but there was no incentive (free spring rolls maybe?). I expressed concern that the food will be cold. They said that it should be ok. I told them that my husband is upset at the delay. For our troubles, we'll get free spring rolls on our next order. 90 minutes after ordering, the food came. The driver apologized and gave a completely different story for the delay. The food was cold. The Pad Thai was gummy as all the sauce was absorbed by the noodles. It was all clumped together. The Tom Yum was too sweet. The Red Curry did not have lychee which is strange as the name includes it. I'd give this place zero stars if I could. I guess my search
4013;Nothing famous or good about this place.  Much better shawarma in Aurora.  Very disappointed with the food, it was cold tasteless and obviously not fresh.
4014;Not very good food at all. Just spent $35 on takeout and it's all in the garbage. I'm pretty sure the chicken was bad.
4015;Just finished a disappointing takeout dinner from Vincent Sushi.  Ordered a sushi/maki combo.  The fish did not taste especially fresh, and the rice was somewhat dried out in parts.  The miso soup was the blandest I've ever had, and barely lukewarm.  But the worst part was the salad: it literally looked like soup, it had so much dressing, and the lettuce was wilted as if it had been dressed days ago.   Straight to the garbage.  I am not one to make a fuss, and the salad is always an afterthought with takeout sushi, but this was just an insult.  Moreover, when you start a meal with something that terrible and careless, it really makes you uneasy about eating raw fish prepared by the same kitchen.  Prices here are a little higher than comparable sushi restos, and there is certainly no justification for that.  Will not be back to Vincent Sushi, which is too bad as it's the nearest sushi restaurant to my home.
4016;This pho was so fucking bad I couldn't even find a rating for how shit  it was. Constructive criticism don't dilute the broth
4017;The food was good/decent.The low review is for the LACK of signage in front that this is CASH ONLY.It's 2017 if you don't have debit, you are both lazy and most likely 'particular' about what gets claimed at the end of the year...  When I have to walk down the street, pay a debit fee and banking fee to get your 'blessed' cash, it's annoying.  There are a lot of us 'cashless' folks these days, get on-board.  Ultimately I would go back to the other PHO places in the area, easier/cheaper.  Plus what is it with Vietnamese restaurant/daycare?!  Wandering toddler switching between crying or hollering ain't endearing!
4018;This review is long overdue.  Didnt have a yelp account back then.  If you are of a white background, your food will be good.  If you are of another ethnicity, there is a very goof chance youll get cut-eye from both customers and staff.    My husband(white) and i(asian) went to this restuarant because the place we orginially wanted to go to wad closed.  We decided to eat on the patio.  And all we got was dirty looks from customers and attitude from our waitress.  She took a very long time to bring us our drinks and take our order.We ordered the exact same thing.  Calamari, except mine was the dinner and his was the appetizer.  His food came first, and we didnt thing much of it at the moment, so he held off eating his food till mine came.  While waiting he wanted to order another drink, but our waitress avoided our table like the plegue.  So he got up and got his deink himself at the bar.  15min later, my food still hasnt come, so my husband and i started to share his food, thinking we would just split mine 
4019;Had a chicken shawarma wrap there. Not great at all. The pita wasn't fresh as well. There are much better shawarma places, not in the area though (Mr. Laffa, Sofra grill, dr. Laffa all much better). First and last time here.
4020;The babaganoush was so bad it was inedible. I'm not even sure there was any eggplant in it. Tasted like mayonnaise and nothing? If it wasn't out of my way I would drive back and and dare them to eat their own food.
4021;Went for lunch with a friend today. I ordered a burger and fries he ordered a chicken shwarma. The burger took over 20 min to get to me. It was not worth the wait. A homemade burger with unfamiliar spices I did not care for. The fries were lackluster. My buddy was not impressed with the shwarma. Neither of  us will be back again.
4022;If you've ever had a falafel in the Annex in Toronto, you know what a good falafel is and what it's supposed to be. The falafel here was a tasteless mess. Truly awful. All the 5 star reviews are obviously from people who never go into the city.On another note: the restaurant was not clean when I was in there. I saw a lot of flies and food crumbs all over the dining area floor.
4023;Horrible service. They took the orders of people who came in after me.  Then they served people who ordered after me.  I felt like they ignored me because I was on my own. I waited for over 30 minuted then they said the kitchen messed up.  If you are going to keep your customers happy , hire more staff that know what they are doing.
4024;Came in to order take out today for lunch, cause my fave Viet place was closed.First thing you should know is that I am a petite Vietnamese girl and I cook extensively - so, yes, I know what I'm talking about. Also, I do not write reviews because I have 3 kids under the age of 5 and do not have the time or inclination, but I was real angry today. Don't screw with my food.I ordered: XL pho dac biet (with all the weird Viet meats), bun noodles with grilled beef and two orders of the veggie spring rolls.Pho: - the broth was flavourful balanced and had depth-  they did not separate the raw meat from everything else so my noodles were bloody (thanks for that.)- the cooked meats were cold so when everything was combined I had to reheat the damn thing which in turn over cooked the rare beef and made the broth murky- there is a shit ton of msg in the broth and I died of thirst afterwards- not enough bean sprouts and basil especially for an extra large order Bun noodles with grilled beef:- the grilled be
4025;Came for dinner wit hubby. We were excited to try a pho place in Newmarket.Pho: broth a bit on the sweet side. Portions are good for a small and massive for an XL order. Beef is fresh. However, quite thirsty 30mins post meal. Sweet and sour soup with shrimp: not really good in terms of how the ingredients are put together overall as the soup. Bunch of bean sprouts in a hot sweet and sour broth and fresh cooked shrimps(not bad). But seems like the everything had its own taste in the soup and cannot really taste unified as a soup. Fresh rolls with shrimp: rolls were good but not too satisfied with the dipping sauce, seems blend and watered down in terms of its flavour. Service: nothing to complain about until the end where we paid with Amex at the cashier and transaction was already approved and went thru, then the owner refunded it on her own and came to us and said she did not have Amex registered for service in the machine.  Insisted she already refunded it back into our credit card already, gave us 
4026;I don't know what the fuzz about? I tried to choose zero but I couldn't . So I went with one starIf you love Indian food you are going to be disappointed the butter chicken tastes nothing like butter chicken The Manchurian beef was too salty it could give you a heart attack. Plus they will tell you it's chilli. The realty it's not even 1/10 chilliVery disappointing experience plus our bill was 25 for two meals, one of them only had rice, no drinks. Also over priced
4027;Was okay.  Nothing spectacular.  The server was just lost. He took or order for something they no longer had.  only to have us waiting for something that was never being made lolWould never go back
4028;I tried their food first time on my friends recommendation and I really got disappointed. The taste of their food is not too impressive. Their food is full of sodium and colour. The taste of their food is garbage compare to other good Hakka restaurants. I have been to better Hakka Chinese places like wok n roll on Erin mills and Millcreek. And their price is same as any other place. I would never go back there.
4029;Visited because of the reviews.  All I can say is the owner must be paying for reviews because the quality of the food in no way warrants anything more than a 2.  The portions are large, the food is - words fail me- nasty.  Loads of free rice, - chilli chicken - disappointing in the extreme, crispy beef?  So crispy you can't even get your teeth into it.  Miserable tiny little pieces of hard overcooked beef.  Getting stung like this makes me question yelp and trust reviews less!  This guy even has a notice on his front door about his yelp reviews. Don't believe all the good reviews here!
4030;I had pretty high expectations for this place after reading all of the YELP reviews but I was so disappointed.  We were a group of 8 that decided to order from the menu and share our meals family style.  We had a really hard time finding something on the menu that wasn't deep fried then covered in sauce OR a vegetable of some sort OR not a carb.  All of the dishes are reasonably priced but every single dish we ordered was deep fried then covered in sauce!  I won't be going back ever again.
4031;My first time coming to this place. I saw the reviews, and they have lunch special and went to try it out but I was kind of disappointed with their lunch special. Maybe dinner is better?The lunch special come with the meal and 1 spring roll or pop...I ordered their general tao chicken special for around $9, and the price was reasonable as you can see the portion wasn't bad in my photo.However, 1. rice was hard and kind of a bit dry. I know western people have their rice on the harder side but the rice with my general tao chicken was HARD. Maybe it is hard because I have the lunch special?2. under the general tao chicken was 1/3 of rice underneath. I guess some people like it, but I don't.3. the general tao chicken tasted "OK", I won't say its good or even bad, it was just soso. Maybe its the sauce? I know some places they use ginger and garlic to their sauce to make general tao chicken and you can actually taste the difference. This place just probably use chili and sweet sauce, but maybe I was wrong,
4032;I was not impressed with the food at all. Very greasy and lacking the authenticity, the food gave me stomach churn. Not going back again!
4033;Extremely garlicky .. I cant believe it has so many good reviews have you people never been to any other hakka restaurant
4034;Terrible chicken quality. Had the sweet and spicy chicken, chili chicken, Cantonese style noodles with chicken, and Manchurian chicken. All had the same issue. It was so gross that we left hungry.
4035;DO NOT get takeout from here. It's one thing you eat in and they give you enough food. But when you order the same dish to take home, the portion is cut in half. I don't get why they do that. It's disappointing. And we go here almost every month. But every single takeout the portion that should've been enough to feed 4 in the restaurant becomes just enough for 2... not coming here.
4036;Cheap prices, crappy food.  Don't waste your money on this.  If you want good food, go to the Ali Baba on Lawrence.  No connection to this.
4037;Myself and the gf have gone here on few occasions and the food was good...but our last visit last night was the absolute worst...had fish and chips and wow...fish was over cooked mush...fries were horrible and both looked like they been in the deep fryer way too long...gf had a Greek salad and even she could not finish due to horribly put together...they have definitely lost our business...get a new cook cuz the one they got now wouldn't cut it on bar rescue Lol he sucks!!!
4038;Girl at front counter is obnoxiously rude. My first time there and she was very inconsiderate I asked a couple of questions and she act like I was wasting her time. I gladly walked out and gladly won't ever be stepping my foot in the dirty store again. There are way better competition with polite manners and customer service. What a lousy female!!
4039;I used to come here all the time and recommend it to my coworkers since it was in the area.  But as of today, I'm done.  You cannot serve someone something that was ordered as vegetarian, that you confirmed when dropping off the plate, is vegetarian, but upon a few bites in, is NOT.  Just because I don't go into anaphylaxis upon biting in doesn't mean it's any less serious to me personally.  The servers were not fussed at all when I pointed this out, my half eaten spring roll was served to someone else at the table and nothing was taken off the bill.  I didn't even receive eye contact or an apology.   I won't be back, ever.
4040;I have only been here a few times. I will never go here again.Their rice: I have no idea why they would serve us OLD rice (out of the pot for at least a few hours, if not a day it is hard and crunchy, which is not what I want when I ask for rice). I got the red curry once and the green curry once. They are both horrible. I have no idea what they are doing to their chicken, but it's definitely not fresh. The flavours are also a bit off. If you just had the sauce but not the chicken the curries would be passable.You should stick to their Laotian dishes, since they do those alright. But I just can't accept a restaurant that would serve its customers old rice. It's RICE! How hard can it be to do RICE right?! When my girlfriend complained the second time we went there the server came back, giving us the same rice, but they microwaved it this time (making it harder and crispier).Thanks buddy, that really cemented our decision to never go there again. Fresh rice is not going to kill your profits.Before you 
4041;Service like shit. no drink no menu, waitress is literally blind. Will never come again
4042;I would not recommend eating here or ordering from here. People are insane. This place is always packed around noon and I just don't get it. For $10, yes you get a good sized portion...but it's of OIL!!!!!!!! Every time I've eaten here in the past, I have literally been sick because the food is so incredibly heavy. NOTHING is fresh and anyone who tells you different has no palate. I've tried the chicken fried rice, fresh spring rolls, fried spring rolls,  shrimp fried rice and the spicy pad thai.  All very generic. And any meat you get has obviously sat out raw, or was defrosted prior to your order being placed you can tell in the quality of the food. They could easily do a better job.
4043;Don't eat here.We came here with another couple looking for some great Thai food, and after looking at the reviews and what people had to say we thought this would be the perfect spot.We arrived for dinner at 630 pm and as soon as we sat down the woman came up to us asking what we'd like to order, since we hadn't looked at the menus yet we asked her to come back. Not even 5 mins later she was back asking us what food we wanted and we had to check the closing time as it felt like we were being rushed out of there. We ordered some waters to get her off our backs once we realized we had lots of time before they were closed.We ended up ordering mango salad, spring rolls and chicken satay to start.The mango salad was overly sweet and the satay sauce looked like a brown gelatinous substance which vaguely tasted like peanuts.For the mains we ordered seafood red curry, chicken green curry and chicken and shrimp pad thai.It was the worse Thai food I've ever eaten.We were all hungry but still could not eat the
4044;I am not sure what it was I was tasting: either rancid poppyseeds, or a bagel that had once been frozen and just tasted funny.  In either case, I was not impressed with my first purchase from this place.
4045;As much as I would like to support any new local enterprise I was disappointed with both visits I made to this new store. First visit was okay, the lady made me a great meatloaf sandwich on a house baked bun and I had it with a coffee, yum yum. However the shop layout appeared to have been put up with little retail in mind. Two examples: 1. An old retro style frig filled to the tits with pizza dough, when I opened the door the stuff literally exploded onto the floor. The front window display was an ancient wooden rack filled with plastic bags full of day old reduced breads. How appealing is that? 2. Later as we were finishing up our snack the store filled up with customers. The lady at the cash (an owner I presume) had her hands full servicing the customers, however she received no help from the other employees that were placidly working/chatting in the production area in the rear of the shop. To the Owner/Nice lady: Crack that whip!!3. A year goes by. One fine spring day I passed by and went in for a cof
4046;The pizza is okay but their prices are ridiculous. I was ordering a medium pizza special with two toppings and they counted one topping of chicken as two toppings which I thought was a rip off. The cashier explanation for charging double for one chicken topping is that it's expensive for him. I'm sure if major pizza company can only charge one topping as one then I'm sure they can too.The washrooms and tables are always dirty. The floor are sticky and I do not recommend this pizza take-out.
4047;Absolutely appalling. We got an assortment of sushi (takeout) and every single piece was old, falling apart, and tasted fishy. We actually threw out most of it. I eat a lot of sushi, and I've been to dozens of places in Toronto. This is by far the worst.
4048;I was so excited to try this place. My co-workers keep raving it's the place to go for sushi.  I had to give it a shot. I walked there through the freezing cold weather and came upon a tiny clean sushi place. Two workers were behind the counter making sushi for the lunch rush while my coworker and I picked through the options in the fridge. We both stumbled upon a sushi plate (4 salmon sushi and 6 spicy salmon rolls) for $7.95. Perfect! We both grabbed one each. We went to the cash to pay and the female cashier said "oh this is $9.50" and scribbled out the $7.95 and replaced it with $9.50. She then did the same to my sushi box. My co-worker asked her why we are being penalized for something that is not our fault. She promptly replied that the price was incorrect. My co-worker then said "fine, take my dollar. I will never come back here again".   She then decided to charge us $7.95 for the sushi boxes. I was so appalled by her lack of tack that I refuse to come back here. To top it off, and her behavi
4049;Curry was ok, nothing spectacular. Over priced for what you get. And they charge extra to dine in. I'm from the states and I've never heard of this practice. Sounds like they don't like cleaning up after paying customers. They don't ever have to complain about cleaning up after me ever again.
4050;*PUBIC HAIR FOUND in food* I'm usually very satisfied with my samosas from here. This is all I've ever ordered. Granted the line up is chaotic and they never have the amount I want, I always leave happy having one even!Recently I got a dozen which comes with sauce and chutney. The green chutney sauce had a giant PUBIC hair when I got to the bottom of the container. I'll refrain from disparaging comments but you can imagine my disgust and outrage. Never again!!!!!!!
4051;Confusing SCAM restaurant!!!We usually order take outs from them. Minus the fact they sometimes 'accidently' sold our order to someone who got there quicker (you did not read wrong,it happened more than once), one person would charge us tax one day but not the other, sometimes we'd show up for an order to find out they didn't make it since the order was 'too small to start things up'...we grudgedly go back there for lunch because it's Brampton. There's no food option within the 5 km radius. This town makes me cry.Today was last straw. Their take out menu for vegetarian dishes start at $3, and rice for $2.99. Their thali (3 tapas,rice, salad, yogurt, naan, desert deal) is $6.99. But when we sit down instead of ordering take out, they did not tell us prices start at $8.99 + tax. We walked out rightfully assuming our bill to be $10 or less, but it ended up being $29.50!!!!! How on earth did they design this menu?!?I say, regardless of the quality of their food, these people should not be in business becaus
4052;People taking orders are part of the restaurant experience... For Sweet Palace they will cut you up for critiquing they're service level... I watched the owners wife tell a customer not to come back if he didn't like cold somosas...turns out neither do I, so I also left! Never went back.
4053;This place sucks.  Overpriced sushi, service is o.k. No mints... Taste of the food is o.k. Thus, not a recommended place I would go to.
4054;So incredibly disappointed. Made a reservation to avoid seating issues but still spent 45 minutes waiting. This was after being sternly told to arrive on time. Finally went to wait at the bar only to be given a broken wine glass. Once we determined that we would miss our next engagement if we waited, we were STILL charged for the sip of beer we consumed. (No sign of replacement wine by the way). This is the second time we have been disappointed by Sushi Den and the LAST time we will try.
4055;From an Asian eating lots of AYCE, this restaurant doesn't worth 4* at all. Probably this can only fool local people. Rice has bad quality. No sashimi from lunch AYCE. Sushi is sliced horribly. The Hot and Sour soup is so sour that can't even take a second sip. The sushi roll is cut unevenly. Overall, very bad quality and the selection from lunch AYCE doesn't worth $14.99. Won't ever come back again.
4056;If you don't care about your health or the environment than this place is for you. They really should change the name of this place to "BPA TOXIC Tropical Joes" and their mission statement should be "we use black plastic for your food because it is toxic and all black plastic is non-recyclable" . The plastic containers they now use are fully non-recyclable and loaded with BPA. Want breast cancer? then this is the place for you. These plastic containers when mixed with hot food spells TOXIC. Originally they didn't use these containers, they switched because servicing convenience became more important than health and environment.  The BPA plastic dish scares the hell out of me. Hot food and plastic should never be mixed. We need to put pressure on fast food joints to not mix hot food with plastic. Wake up people. Think of your health folks and think of your kids health. It not enough to just vote with your spending, you need to send a message loud and clear. "Those who know, have a duty to act". In a review the
4057;I gotta say this place is now a mall court fast food place.  No longer cut chicken quarters in ur order.  Pre cooked boneless shit in your take out plastic shiny container. The nice guy that was out front may be gone. U got now this bitchy non interested employee that seems like fuck u and fuck ur order.  I mentioned I must have not been here in awhile and chicken different. She was like ya easier for roti. Then when I went to pay the stupid interact didn't work and I had to go to the CIBC beside it and paid $3. mentioned ur machine is not working and she again was a bitch and said it worked before u.  She was an employee before for the nice guy. And was a pig then.  I hope she reads this and understand that a smile and a bit of niceness goes a long way.  I love the tip cup. I should of took $3 for the bullshit I went through.  And the food was meh.  No longer a good place.   Just mall food.
4058;Has anyone cut open their so called "general tao chicken"?  There's absolutely no chicken inside.  I cut open every single piece (approx 15) and it was all dough.  I challenge anyone to go and do the same and let me know if there was any chicken inside.  STAY AWAY!!!
4059;I decided to hubby for a late lunch and looked to Yelp for a Greek restaurant in York Region. I spotted the reviews for Kosmos and thought, great it does breakfast/brunch and Greek food.The pictures are highly deceiving as when you first walk in it feels very cold and yet very grungy. But putting aside first impressions we sat down at one of what seemed like a million wobbly tables. Okay, still could be fine, maybe the food is awesome. I ordered the gyro small plate with Greek salad and roast potatoes, the hubby ordered the Kosmos burger with cheese and bacon. It took a reasonable amount of time to come out. Hubby's burger was very, very overdone as in they tried to cremate the cow. And the bun was also charred but they tried to cover it up with slathering on ketchup, mustard, and relish but to no avail. My small gyro plate very mediocre. I have had gyro at Mr. Greek and I would say it was easily comparable. Plus my "roast" potatoes where cold in the middle and slathered in what I assume was an attemp
4060;Terrible service and terribly cooked food. I've been here before and it was amazing. This time we had to wait over an hour for a table when we were promised 20 minute wait. We were basically forced to leave  and were promised a call and then they totally forgot about us and I had to come back and ask to remind them. By then we were starving and I pretty much begged the waitress for bread and some quick starters like the feta cheese plate. 40 minutes later and nothing had come to the table... Not even water!!! Apparently they ran out of kettles and glasses. Fast forward and the apps and water come but  with missing items and no bread. We had to finish the starters without bread. The when we asked for it we found out it was sitting at the bar for a while and nobody thought to put it on our table. Then the food arrived. Sunnyside eggs were over cooked with solid yolks and rubbery whites and over medium was undercooked with runny whites. I know, this sounds like it's impossible but they managed to do it. We had t
4061;This place is definitely a hole in the wall! Inside out, which ever angle you look at it, this place just screams ugliness. LOL Although I really admire the old Asian couple that run this joint in no way am I cutting them any slack for the mediocre food.Dry, dry, dry uninspiring chicken. Nothing worthy of mention here and not really worth trying either if you're on the fence. The only thing that stands out is the affordability of this place.If you want cheap calories, go ahead!
4062;I was expecting more based on the good reviews I saw, but it was a disappointment.I know this is a hole in the wall place and I didn't expect anything fancy - after all, it's the food that matters. However, I didn't find the food too exciting. I had the chicken leg with Greek salad. The chicken was cold and a bit too salty, and the salad was a bit bland. I do admit the price was pretty cheap, but you get what you paid for.
4063;My last experience with BAKA CAFE was a total disaster.Ive ordered a sandwich with a soup, was told it would take 20 minutes (because it was a busy Friday night). Not a problem. 15 minutes later one of the staff approached my and informed that they ran out of the sandwich that I ordered, so I chose another one. 25 minutes later I asked what happened to my order - the other serve went to the kitchen and upon returned asked me what I ordered. My order was simply forgotten. Nobody checked on me that I did't have my order. I asked for my money back and left.The staff is mostly young and unexperienced. The whole order taking and processing is a mess. It is a shame since the food is pretty good.
4064;This place used to be good, but they have been cheaping out on the small things lately, which takes away from the experience. Charging extra for jam and no longer including fruit with $11.25 french toast?! Really? On top of that, service is painfully slow. Rarely get acknowledged. As of today, no longer giving this place my business. Treat your customers better and don't be so cheap!!
4065;Wow... for a place that I've been going to since before it was Burro Burrito and occupied the corner of College and Clinton (yes, that was a long while ago), I'm sad to say that this place has officially hit rock bottom. Due to their failed business venture of "Tapas Slider" that was once next door (for it's short lived life), they've become increasingly more expensive and increasingly lower quality. This used to be my favourite place and everyone at our office would literally be coming here at least once a week. I have to say that after their change to "premium" meats that I noticed for the first time the other day, it is no longer worth it. I get that they probably lost a bunch of money, but you're killing your regulars by constantly changing the price and adding new "stipulations" to every aspect of the order. We came back time and time again even after the staff would tell us "that costs extra" for literally EVERYTHING ("for instance, can I have a bit more lettuce? - no, costs extra"). The problem is 
4066;Worst Service. I couldn't get a straight answer as to whether they could make a simple cold pressed coffee. One of the counter staff let me sample some of their cold brew but when I asked him to make me an iced one with some of their soy milk, he became baffled that I wanted to actually get a drink there!   What??  I was waiting for a hidden camera or something, like is he serious??  Then he asked the other counter staff who said, the thing is, we don't serve that here.  So I then asked, well why do you make it, give a sample, get me to custom order the beverage etc.  She said she did not know what to charge for this drink.  Again, I was kind of chuckling, thinking they were kidding, so I put down a fiver....but they acted like suddenly I was robbing them...they stared at me like proverbial deer....Again, I said, some of that coffee I just sampled, with some ice & soy milk please.  They just shut down (looked like they were suddenly requiring a re-boot!) and said they can't...I grew really kind of upset. Ther
4067;The absolute worst service. I've been there 3X - horrible customer service. Young and entitled staff. Attempted to order and purchase juice recently over the phone and had the worst experience - they put the phone on the counter and h staff were speaking about me in the rudest way! Unprofessional. For an organic food-energy juice bar, the hired staff is entitled and horrible. The owners/manager seem lovely, too bad their staff represents them in the worst light.
4068;DO NOT GO HERE! I have a life-threatening allergy to eggs and went here to try a dessert, which I usually cannot from elsewhere, as majority of them contain egg or egg products. I informed them about my allergies, even though I knew that the place was purely vegan. I made sure to let them know that even if there is a slight chance of cross-contamination, I will have an anaphylactic attack. I ordered a pumpkin pie slice to go, ate a bite, started to feel my throat closing up and was rushed to the hospital. I called them the next day and asked to speak to the manager. They denied me the chance, saying that he/she was too busy. When I told the girl who picked up the phone about the issue, instead of apologizing for the mistake, she was extremely rude and said that it wasn't their fault because the pies are made elsewhere. So overall,1) If you are going there because you follow a vegan diet, you are probably not getting food without animal products mixed in. The fact that one bite of the pie caused a severe rea
4069;Went to Blake House - I like premium Vodka - I like a double - however Blake House likes to stiff their patrons - double the price for premium.  I can get a double Premium Vodka drink at almost anywhere else for $10 to $13 - however at The Blake House it's $20.  There are 33 ounces in a Litre of Vodka - at that price The Blake House is making $330/bottle - it costs $45 - I will never go there again until they change this ridiculous gouging!!!!FU Blake House
4070;The atmosphere was great and the patio was packed. The three of us had beers, can't go wrong with beer but dinner was a disappointment. One of us had the Cesar Salad with chicken which was OK but two of us had the Flat Iron Steak Salad and it was minimal at best. The steak was good, what there was of it, but the salad was just weeds with no dressing. Thank goodness for the little bread they brought to the table. A great place for afternoon beers on the patio with maybe an appetizer or two to share but not for a full meal.
4071;I hope they fire the miserable bartender that served us. Don't worry, we will be back to give you another chance to redeem yourself. Be prepared to earn your tips!  Beaaatch.
4072;As a traveling business owning woman on a work trip to Toronto I rolled up on a Friday eve around 8pm to a half empty restaurant, it took a while to get seated (what everyone was so busy doing I can't imagine), I was then offered a seat as tucked away as possible by the "maitre'd". The restaurant by now was a third full, lots of wait staff and yet after 20 minutes I had yet to be offered a glass of water let alone asked for my order.  I left.  So tiresome.  Whoever owns this restaurant and if they are on this earth because of a woman needs to clean house.  Its 2017 and to be treated by this is pathetic.
4073;The Blake House is literally in my backyard. I've tried it a few times and have never been wowed, but kept giving it a shot since it is so close. Today was the last time I'll ever visit. We went for Summerlicious--which had one of the 2 dishes we typically order. Upon arriving, the waitress said you need to make reservations to order off the summerlicious menu because it puts a lot of strain on the kitchen and they need to know what to expect. I could understand--but there were literally 2 other people in the restaurant. Plus, their website says nothing about making reservations for Summerlicious, nor is there any signage to this effect inside or outside of their establishment. She brought the menu to us and graciously allowed us to order. We received a nice size portion of a pre-dressed and over-dressed salad [that was inedible]--the pasta we are used to, minus all the regular veggies [only a few pieces of chopped tomatoes]--and a small scoop of ice cream that had been pre-scooped and frozen with 2 cherries 
4074;They were awesome and made tacos with love but now they throw them together without any concern for actually filling them up.
4075;Overpriced hipster-businessman food. The kimchee doesn't have any Korean ingredients in it. The meals have horrible pun names, so the head chef must be a bit of a head case. Financial district people line up because there is a line up in which to be seen.  Grabs hold of fading trends and appropriates them into a sub par approximation of other, better fast food restaurants' attempts.
4076;terrible service and food is not so great either. they took an hour to bring out our food, we were at the restaraunt for 3hrs!
4077;Ordered the salmon special with shaved truffle--there was no truffle. The owner admitted that they messed up, but his solution was to offer us a drink or a dessert with a candle in it because it was my birthday. We payed the $450 bill (included a bottle of wine) with a 20% tip (because it wasn't the waiter's fault), but when I spoke to the owner afterwards I told him that the appropriate adjustment would have been to take the item off of our bill. He did offer to do that, but I told him that it wasn't about the money and I just wanted to let him know that he should have automatically made the correction at the time that he admitted their mistake. Don't get me wrong, everything else was delicious, really!  But we would have loved to have gone back there and now just feel like we can't endorse them.
4078;I went there for some sweet wine or dessert after a meat-heavy dinner with a couple of friends. We were traveling from the U.S. on vacation and were looking forward to a good sweet wine such as a late-harvest Riesling or Canadian ice wine to celebrate our last day in Canada. There was a Riesling Alsace Cuvée Ste. Catherine 2001 for $22.50 per glass that I ordered under the recommendation of the waitress/sommelier that it was a "very sweet" wine from France. I specifically asked her about the wine because I was not familiar with Ste. Catherine. I asked her again if it was sweet because sweet Rieslings from Alsace are rare except the late harvests. It was definitely not a sweet wine. I explained this to the waitress and asked if she had tasted the wine. She insisted that she had and she stuck to her claim that is was very sweet. She was, in fact, offended by my question about whether she had tasted the wine. I have never gone to such a high-end wine bar with such an unprofessional waitress who argues with the c
4079;Bought a cake from here once and it was awful. Every bite tasted like a spoonful of sugar. There was too much icing, and the texture of the cake was dry and crumbly. Wouldn't come back.
4080;Sometimes I don't get why places like this got 4 stars reviews. I wanted to eat beef teriyaki really bad yesterday and passed by this restaurant. As soon as I came in no body was there and we need to wait to be seated, pls keep in mind there's only one costumer they have so there's no excuse for slow service. I looked at the menu and noticed that this place is way wayyyyyy over priced. I ordered beef teriyaki and agedashi tofu. It came in a very small portion. And here's when things got really bad, I ordered beef teriyaki from all over sushi place. And this is the only restaurant that charge me 30 bucks for ONLY beef teriyaki and miso soup, there's no shrimp tempura and any other tempura. My bill was 45 plus tax and tips. Oh and to just let you guys know, they charge 3 dollar for a glass "small-tiny" glass of green tea. There's a lot of more affordable authentic sushi restaurant that is more affordable. Note: the service was decent, but can be more attentive. Definitely not coming back!
4081;I give this place 6 more months.I came here based on Yelp reviews.  Must've been an off day.  I got the sashimi plate for take out.  Fish was not fresh, portions were small, wasabi was pasty, and not good price for value. Also, the ratio of styrofoam and plastic to food is ridiculously high. I sat there for about 15min waiting for my order and it occurred to the waitress to bring me tea at the very end as I was paying, like she just remembered she wanted tips.  I guess I should've taken a hint from the fact that I was the only patron in there.
4082;These are one of the few times that a restaurant deserves no stars.We came here with a group of 6. Upon entrance, the server (lady) looked at us oddly, and randomly pointed us to a seat in the front. As we sat down, we waited about 5 minutes patiently to see the menu. There was no one to be seen in that entire time. Another group walked in, their greeting was MUCH different than ours. They received a smile and a greeting, and menus right away. Since they were sitting next to us the server was dropping off their menus, and only there we literally had to flag the woman down to get ours... She resentfully gave us menus. After another 5 minutes of scanning the menu, and looking at the overpriced items, STILL no one came to ask us if we wanted tea, if we were ready to order. We waited patiently for another 10 minutes. And still no one came to see us. We were fed up with the horrible service from the get go, and got up and left.Really disappointed, and confused as to why this restaurant has 4 stars. I hig
4083;Over priced and the food is not so good you figure your paying a lot for your meal that the food would make it worth it. Not in this place.
4084;Came here and immediate a bad first impression when was not seated promptly. We were seated and was not acknowledge after that. No menus, no water, no tea. After many minutes of waiting, we left. Can't believe how we were treated.
4085;Rhank (yes on purpose) you for the despicable service and food. There is a certain discernment considering what hour it was 10:00 pm. Just because you're from the east coast and you might have a hard time getting the food served to the three patrons of your concern, the thousands of dollars ive dropped in your establishment could have been greeted with even remote appreciation. Believe me the food isnt good enough to be treated like shit on top. Thanks for ALLOWING ME to OVERTIP 25% because  I feel so fucking bad for you i wouldnt want you people to go home with more depression than you must already have.Thanks for taking my money.
4086;I use to come to this place very often and I loved it. But for some reason it changed, they r super rude and do not acknowledge the customers.Last two times I went to have brunch it took forever for someone to ask us to seat and the food took a super long time and everytime we askes for something they will take the time and keep forgeting things.And then the next time the same took forever to let us have a seat (and there was tables available) then when we finally sat down, we waited at the table for about 10 mins, the waitress passed by us 5 times, we did not have a menu and not even drinks, so we stand up and when we going towards the door to leave, the server yelled at us that she was going to be with us in a second and came running to take our order.We just left and we are not coming back, such a shame, i use to like the food.Never going back again :(
4087;13 dollars for a really bland salad. Overpriced and nothing speical.
4088;Change, before is good but no more. Fish not fresh and worse service. 0 star.
4089;Wrote a previous review, but I need to change this. This place now gets a one star from me. Staff isn't friendly and doesn't talk to customers at all. And if you ask for anything they treat your simple requests (ie. Having a glass of water) as the most difficult request you could make and that you're bothering them. Had to ask multiple times for items we ordered 20+ minutes before that we still hasn't received. They only gave us two order sheets for 2 people, and when we asked for extras they handed us just one. We order in small batches so we don't over order and waste. But they didn't want us ordering as little we did anyways. They can't seem to handle a full busy restaurant, and get overwhelmed quickly. They avoid eye contact with customers, seems to be a way to not talk to customers. The only time we got speedy service was when we were paying to leave. I won't be returning again.
4090;Never listen to a non-Korean when they rave about a Korean restaurant. This isn't like Italian food that is so pervasive in our "Canadian" diet that ethnic background really doesn't matter. Korean food is something you need to have been immersed in - not necessarily raised on, but immersed in.  If you are not Korean, but spent two years fully engaging in Korean food and cultural activities in Korea, then your word counts.  The reviews received here for all dishes other than this places known favourite: naeng myun, were most likely non Koreans who saw the line up in the summer and thought it had to be a good place. Why else the line up, right?  Honestly, the naeng myun is good if you are into that. Anything outside of the naeng myun is just ok but nothing to wait in line for.  So why the 1 star?  The Korean restaurant experience is not only about food but the service. Koreans are of a culture that elevates the guest to a position of honour and respect.  As such many Korean restaurants will provide little ext
4091;I wasn't impressed with the food or attitude of the employees.The tortillas were from a package and when I tried to alter one ingredient on one of the tacos I was given attitude saying "people try to ruin their tacos". If they are so concerned with the artistic integrity of their product, they should be making better tasting tortillas in-house.
4092;I have been to this restaurant before but this time is the worst customer experience one can have, I order fried rice with the ying yan source(sweet on one side and the other is white source) and bbq pork side dish.  At first the fried rice look nice, but when I bite into the shrimp it tasted funky. Believe me, I usually cook at home, and I can tell was is fresh and what is not, I paid almost 15 with tax, for one dish, please do not give me ingredient that is not fresh come on, then comes the bbq pork.  The most disappointing part of the dish, is that this restaurant pull all the old mean at the bottom to make it look good on the top, and after you eat into it, you later find out that all the old meat is in the bottom, and they tried to hide it too, by adding soya sauce to it so you can't tell that it has been a long time, and they are still serving old meat, come on. And to top it all off the bill was not cheap, came to around 60 with tax for 2 dish, with old meat and funky shrimp.....Save your money and fin
4093;Rude waitresses and owner. Sneaky butcher and cashier.If you refuse their hard selling, they will sneak the way more pieces into your order so they can charge you way more! They also switch out meats even you have paid for the premium and give you the fat and crappy ones. To all, don't forget to check your order and receipt before you leave the take out session. Otherwise you will get 'surprises'. What a shame a well know restaurant to treat its loyal customers in this way!
4094;First time going and last time. Their menu consists of burgers ,fish and chips and salads and they had none of the above "SHUT IT DOWN!" Chef Ramsey would say. After spending close to an hour waiting for coffee, water and our food. Which we ordered only two vegan bowls and one burger. The waitress informed us that they had no vegan bowls , fish and chips and no burgers left. They had nothing left to serve. You would think since we spent almost an hour there and did not receive coffee and water only one beer and one pop. That the bill would be complementary. But it was not. After telling us the news she handed over the bill. I was in shock. We only paid for the beer and we left. I was looking forward to eating here. And now I will say I will not be returning. I have never been more disappointed with a restaurant experience in my life.
4095;Based on the reviews, and with a craving for roti, I gave this place a try last week. Bad decision. I ordered some doubles with 2 roti's, chicken and duck. Found the doubles sooooo oily and the chicken roti wasn't so great. My girlfriend said her duck roti was okay. I only ate half of my roti. Fast forward a few hours - I was in the washroom all night suffering from severe cramps and one of the worst stomach aches I've had in my life. My girlfriend was fine, so I was wondering what the heck I ate. The next day, she ate the other half of my chicken roti. You guessed it...... that same night she had the same "crappy" experience that I did. This was my first ACR experience and will be my last. I will NEVER, ever, ever evvvvvvvvarrrrrrr go to this place again.
4096;I had the worst brunch, ever. It was seriously bad. It was gross actually. I ended up leaving hungry! On top of that, you'll leave smelling like a fire pit. Also, whoever makes the coffee should be fired because they obviously don't drink it or they would have realized it was salty. Yes, undrinkable and salty. I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth for the rest of the day. (Note: sometimes ppl add a dash of salt to cheap coffee to cut down on the bitterness, I know. A dash, not a cup ppl!) And when I let the server know, she remarked that they serve Maxwell House, like that was something they should be advertising! It became a game to watch other ppl order a cup and see them make faces. I still can't believe I paid for such a lousy experience.  (We had planned to eat at Rose and Sons but it was busy so the hostess suggested we try BC instead. I wish I'd ignored her advice.)
4097;No idea why this place is so highly rated. The popular ribs were dry and tough like jerky... and so heavily charred that all we tasted was smoky carbon.The salmon poke was very nice, but I was so grossed out by the ribs that I can't rate higher. This is supposed to be a BBQ restaurant! If you like tender ribs forget about this place. For the price you can go to so many better restaurants.
4098;Reviews made us visit this place after shopping around Cumberland/Bloor West. First of all I was quite disappointed with the service. Yes, we did not make a reservation but it was a Monday night and we didn't think it would be busy. The hostess/waitress and I did not start off on a good foot. I felt a little annoyance from her that we came to the restaurant without reservation. Our server/hostess took our order once we were finally seated, but never followed up how our dinner was. We had a difficult time getting our server's attention throughout our stay at this restaurant. I would understand if it was crazy busy but it wasn't for a Monday night. We had another waiter get us our water, condiments and finally our bill. Secondly the food was disappointing. My bf and I ordered the popular ribs and was very disappointed. The ribs were very dry and burnt and could not really enjoy the flavour. One end of the ribs was not as dry as the other end but for the cost we were not impressed. There was a bit of a weird
4099;Atmosphere is ok. The food is awful and really expensive. The ribs were dry, salty, and had pesto instead of bbq sauce which overpowered whatever smokiness the ribs had. Pesto was good on its own. The pickles weren't good, baba ganoush wasnt good either.I tried a piece of the tri-tip and that was good.Drinks are also more expensive than most places. I got charged $28 for a double shot drink. Music was all backstreet boys and nsyncGreat place to take someone you hate if they're paying
4100;Is this all some sort of a joke? Is the emperor wearing any clothes?A waiter with terrible teeth sits down next to us uninvited and whispers amid all the din. Yes, yes, I know this is supposed to be a style a la certain American restaurants (the sitting down uninvited part, not the teeth part American student waiters usually have perfect teeth). Sorry, never been a fan, but let's move on.The drinks come in Hobbit-sized glasses while sporting outlandish prices. The famous chef didn't personally tend the orange groves that produced the cartoned Tropicana OJ, did he?The ribs with pear is curious. Oh, I love thinking "outside the box", and I love ribs, and I love pears. Give me weird food. I'm game. But there's gotta be a point to it. The ribs are edible but nothing to write home about. The pear on the side is quite tasty, except it does nothing to rescue the sad ribs. Why are they together? To distract from the utter blandness of the meat? To disguise the poor skills of the pit master? Why not add anchovy
4101;Ate here on business this week. As a vegetarian going to a BBQ place, I did some quick research before agreeing to go. I was misled (not their fault) by another review elsewhere that they have a vegetarian menu. They don't. So this review is only to try and manage expectations for others. The veggie options are the sides, which consisted of broccoli covered in cheese, potatoe salad, kimchi and a bag of chips (yes, an actual personal sized bag of chips). If you have diary issues, and don't eat meat, don't go here. They said they're expanding their vegetarian options in the weeks to come, so it might get better. However, the seat backs will likely still be made of cow hide, so there is that...Also, if you're an environmentalist, the poorly insulated, propane heated, basically open to the out-doors space (ala Hemmingway's rooftop patio) will also likely offend. The rest of our group had a fantastic time. So if you love BBQ, apparently this place is pretty good. Just not for 5% of the population.
4102;Just ordered from UberEats -- have ordered many times in the past, but will not longer patronise their restaurant again. Egregiously overpriced with terribly small portions. Ordered the Korean ribs -- $19 for 2.5 burnt, dry ribs. A real let down.
4103;Hair in my food. Hair! Curly beard hair!Not mine, definitely not a match in colour or texture. I returned my food, discretely pointing to the hair and was asked if I'd like something else, which I politely declined. Didn't comp my coffee, which would have been a nice gesture.I've been here three times and each time was not impressive.Eclairs always taste stale & a little tough. Yesterday's stock? Huge disappointment in flavour as well. Another reviewer had the same comments.Croissants and jalapeño bread are excellent.Service is disinterested. No one cracks a smile, not even the owner. As if you're too cool to serve your customers?Definitely not inviting, despite the nice decor.Walk down to Capitol Espresso, better service, excellent coffee and lovely choice of baked goods. Yes, not as fancy looking but at a fraction of cost.Had high hopes for this place given the owner's pedigree, and since it's local, it would have been a win-win.Sadly, never going here again.
4104;Caution: Do not eat the Ham & Cheese Croissants sitting in the display! It was obviously not freshly made, must have been sitting there from the previous day. They did ask if we wanted it heated up (which would have likely helped with the fact that it was dry and stale) I opted out because of the walk we had ahead of us... needless to say it was a total disappointment. I ordered mine with no cheese and it took 10 mins to put together but at least it was a fresh croissant... much better but the $9 price tag is certainly not justified.
4105;The service was really bad, been here twice and one time closed outside regular hours without any notifications, so came here from downtown for nothing
4106;90% of their pastries have French names which is what I expected for a place that advertises itself as "Paris in Parkdale". However when I ordered them, the staff said: sorry I just speak English. Portions are on the small end, starting with 4cm. éclairs for $2.5 go look at what L'éclair de Génie offers in Paris- the city where this mediocre pastry place in Parkdale calls "home".
4107;I went again, because I'm open minded, and it was a friend's birthday.Service was very slow, it took us over 45 minutes to get our appetizers:Hen-o'-the-woods mushrooms were over-salted, the accompanying wild rice was under-cooked.Raw Alaskan sea scallops came with soggy, excessively vinegared vegetables trace amounts of micro-basil were nice--could have used more!It took another 45 minutes to get our mains (i.e. over an hour and a half from when we ordered):Roast Lake Erie pickeral [sic] was astonishingly bland.Warm kale salad was the only part of the meal that approached satisfactory: chewy and sour, but not displeasing.I am never going back under any circumstances!
4108;The good is great but the service is non-existent. I've never felt more unwelcome or more of an annoyance to simply order a second drink or ask questions about the food. I've been three times and each time was the same. Horrible, horrible service.
4109;Great disappointment! Sadly. The appetizer (beef crudo) was overpowered by pine flavour and simply not satisfying. My main (ox tongue) burned black and inedible (sent it back after a first bite and decided not to take a chance on another dish). My GF's main (pasta with rabbit ragu) was relatively good. The (small portion) of side brussels sprouts was ok but not worth the price. The one thing that was outstanding was bread. Perhaps this is the business they should stick to - bakery. Will not go back.
4110;What a pretentious, hipster hellhole. I was out for dinner with two friends last night, looking to try a few different places we'd heard about along College. We didn't have a reservation at Woodlot, but dropped by and saw there was no one waiting in the lineup, so asked to put our names on the list. The hostess told us it would be approximately 45 minutes for a table to come free, but that it might be available earlier and we could leave our phone number and she'd call us when they had a spot. It was early (7:45) so we went for it, left our number and headed around the corner for a drink.An hour later, we still hadn't heard from them, so I called to ask what was happening with the table. The hostess told me the people at our table were still waiting for their desserts and that it would be another 20 minutes. I started to get frustrated as, to me, there is a big difference in being asked to wait 45 minutes for a table and being told it would be 1 hour 30 min. She told me the 45 minute wait time was "just a
4111;My BF took me out for my birthday dinner here and we were both VERY disappointed. Maybe we just happened to be in on a bad day, maybe the wrong chef was on shift that night,  but it wasn't the service that was disappointing IT WAS THE FOOD.The restaurant is cute and you can see the huge wood burning oven they have there. The staff were all very friendly and service was great. We had what felt like the best seat in the house. But....the food.The bread that is made in-house was dry and some of it was burnt. The gnocci was VERY tasty but portion was weak. The asparagus was okay but portion was weak. The steak. This is why I'm writing this review (I don't normally write reviews)... we went with the steak because we're meat lovers and you can never go wrong with steak. Plus, we love steak soo much and its very hard to "screw it up". The steak was BAD. It looked great. We asked for medium-rare and they brought us medium-rare. But it was soooo unbelievably tough, we found ourselves gnawing away at piec
4112;After hearing about raves among other foodies, I decided to come here on Valentine's Day. I was ecstatic about its ambiance for this special occasion. Mind you, I booked about 3 months ahead. Where did we end up getting seated? In the middle of the upper floor, squeezed in between other couples, barely having any space to sit down without worrying that our arms and legs would take a swing at other couples trying to have a nice dinner. We are fairly small in terms of size, and I cannot imagine how another person with much taller and/or bigger figure would feel.Ambiance was the only thing that was worth raving about. First of all, the service was incredibly slow. it took an hour, YES ONE HOUR, for our food to arrive. We were not  given an explanation as to why that is. You guessed right, our server NEVER checked up on us. He never bothered to ask if we needed to get some more bread because food hasn't arrived yet. When the food finally came, we were not given utensils. What did we have to do? Flag our waiter 
4113;Would strongly recommend NOT coming here. Value: High price, low value. Came with a large party and was pretty much told that we were expected to get the five course set dinner. It was $55 per person + tax + 18% tip. I was thinking WOW five courses?! Big mistake! Several of the courses had to be shared - 3 plates for 10 people, I had no idea how to split it. This was also the first time I ever had to share a plate of papardelle with four people. Food: I'm not a food critic or picky eater, I'd say the food was average. Nothing special, definitely not worth the $$$$ I paid. Atmosphere: It looked like a shack on the outside and not much better inside. The music in the background wasn't bad, but it was so loud that I had to shout talking to the person sitting across from me. Bonus: There were FLIES everywhere. My friends and I caught about FIVE that night - one got stuck in the butter and two flew into our drinks. Service: A bit arrogant - kept telling us how lucky we were able to get our table and how we
4114;DO NOT GO HERE. 1) the portions are extremely, unreasonably small for the price. (I cannot emphasize this enough). 2) the service was very bad Only go here if you're willing to fork $150+/person by ordering mutliple dishes, go right ahead. If you're looking for quality food for a fair price, do not go here.
4115;Now a days most pouplar restaurants seem to look always the same.classic wood and old Edison light bulbs .An example of this........Woodlot I have to admit they Had a Good ambience it is a typical rustic Canadian style no different from any others very ordinary.However,everybody said "u must try these sodas"but it was Ok!!!!Pork could have been more tender  soo chewy and onion soup was over powered by these aged STINKY cheeses.
4116;Me and my girlfriend went there on a Sunday night. We didn't have reservation but were able to find a spot on the patio ! Menu's selection was very limited but we each ordered 1 appetizer and 1 entree !After a few long minute we get our entrees : crab salad and Yukon gold cheese stick, not bad but nothing Waouw ! Specially after tasting that delicious bread and butter !Then goes an hour and it gets really chilly outside so we decide to sit at the bar!And there goes another 20min to finally get our entrees. And big disappointment ... Small portion, cold, Too salty,... Appetite was gone, and we couldn't finish !The place was not busy, I wish we had a better service. At least a warning about the slowness of the kitchen!
4117;Food was regular, quality was medium and price was high. The only thing I enjoyed was the setup and decoration. I don't think I'll go back here
4118;Terrible reservation system, you call the place but don't get to speak to someone, asked to leave a voicemail with the requested reservation.  Left two voicemails but 24 hours later no call back.  Sent an email and was told hostess would be making calls that afternoon.  Showed up and rude hostess said she did make a call (a mystery call we never did receive), and that we didn't have a reservation.  When asked why she didn't leave a voicemail, hostess said she doesn't leave voicemails (which makes no sense, would have saved us a lot of trouble to let us know they were full).Food smelled good, but that's as far as we got, had to head back out into the rain in search for an alternative.
4119;EAT HERE AND GET YOUR PERSONAL BELONGINGS STOLEN!If you eat at Woodlot be sure to hold your personal belongings jacket or purse in your hands. I ate there with friends a few months ago and someone STOLE my jacket from the rack directly behind our table. It was  winter, a national holiday the next day which meant  stores were closed.I was visiting from out of town. The restaurant manager Kevin made sure that I would be reimbursed for the stolen jacket and Woodlot would send me a check. After months of correspondence , there is still no sign of the money. I even had a kind friend from Toronto go in and speak to Kevin with a copy of the catalog with the jacket in it , the liner of the jacket and a note from the store manager where it was purchased. The fact that your personal property can be stolen right before your eyes is shocking. The way this was handled was completely unprofessional and a waste of my time. I would like to make all customers are warned of Woodlots negligence and careless attitude towards v
4120;This is the worst dining experience I have had in Toronto, perhaps in my life. Seriously, save your money because the food is overpriced and the portions are tiny. The food took ages to arrive, and was bland, cold and small. We had a reservation, however were disappointed to be squeezed into a small table on the top floor, tightly surrounded by many other people. The worst part of the experience was the extremely rude and unhelpful service. We first complained because the wine was corked (obviously not their fault), they replaced it of course, however this took an extra 10 minutes. The butter we were given with our bread was off, it had a cheesy taste to it. My father has worked in the food industry for 30 years and was confident it was off, they of course denied it. The server then dropped food and cutlery on my father, did not apologize until he asked for a wet napkin. We would have to call out to a server if we needed more drinks, napkins... and they would be extremely rude as they were clearly not ser
4121;Overpriced and below average!....this is not what Korean food is supposed to be and the empty dining room on a Saturday is a good indication of that...
4122;This place used to be so good. Now it NOT anymore. Went to this place last night. The waitresses never brought us what we asked for(like a glass or napkins..) haha. Pork hock which is one of their best menu was too hard to chew.. haha. And the chicken was smelly. Literally it took 30 mins to get the bill and there was a mistake on our bill. They charged more. Everything was awful there. Food.. service... Geez. I dont think I will be returning..
4123;Fake greek food. Gyros are not real and frozen. Instead of chicken souvlaki they give you frozen chicken strips. Frozen gyro slices. What a joke and waste of money. Don't waste your time and money. I dont like when people advertise regular bad quality chicken as souvlaki in skewer
4124;Seated quickly and atmosphere and decor is beautiful. I wish I would've visited the washrooms first absolutely disgusting!!!!!! Women's as well.  We family of four ordered calamari. We order this all over at high end to medium scale. Restaurants. The calamari had no flour on it and very very rubbery. We ordered the platter for two. I left 3/4 of it there. Pork ones were still frozen and raw in centre,sausages overcooked , chicken sticks too small and dried up.  We left it all there. I was going to complain but I dint want to ruin ther business while they were busy.  Overall 150$ for that. I could've made this ten times better for probably $10.  Big big waste of money. Do not waste your time. Keith
4125;The chicken souvlaki today was dried up and fish was just ordinary No taste! Ridiculously priced as well! Felt so ripped off today :( Never again
4126;Lol , chicken souvlaki wasn't bad ..but flat soda and the fact that I found a mouse in this restaurant..will never go again .
4127;Went in on a Saturday night, one server (which could be the owner as well) made it not attentive enough. Saw twice that as some eating utensils were put back into the clean pile after they were dropped accidentally onto the ground as she was preparing for the new tables... We went in 9ish, and at around 10:50pm she came to use and said that it was last call. So we rushed in our final orders after a new friend came to join us half an hour ago. Then at 11pm, we witnessed another couple walked in and she would sit them down and whispered to them that they had an hour of eating time. (Meanwhile, she told us it was last call just 10 minutes before then). Before we can ask her why she would told different customers different info, 3 other groups of people came in, and she sat them all down to serve them.....Quality of foods was barely ok, some veggies we ordered were a bit rotten and dry. Seemed like those bulk order off the specially discounted foods rack....  Given the above, we will be happy to rate it n
4128;It is a complete rip-off and food is very mediocre. My friend and I went there one night, we didn't order anything with extra charge, and if ends up $70 workout tips! That's crazy. Too many hidden costs, please be aware.
4129;Located in the same parking area as the Petro Canada Gas station. Not really located on Queensway, more so on cawthra.VERY SMALL LOCATION!Kitchen staff talked so loudly in an Asian/Middle East language it made it difficult to focus on my own conversation. Chairs were stacked well before closing time, which makes me feel like they don't want us there.I will not return to this location.Waitress was pleasant.
4130;Awful, just really awful. The food was really salty and tapas were soggy and not fresh. I complained about the food and unfortunately the owner took it personally. She came out and yelled at us for not enjoying the food. We still don't really know why, but rather than over analyzing it, a better solution is to not return and to warn others who are considering a visit. There are many great restaurants nearby that are worth a venture no need to settle on this one.
4131;Very difficult to order on uber eats. Ordered a chicken plate and got a whole lunch of toppings i did not want.
4132;I was very disappointed with the food and the service. My daughter ordered a dish that was over salted so we sent it back and asked for Pho. They brought it out and didnt bring toppings. When we asked for toppings the server brought them out and I looked like 1/2 of what I got with my pho. Then when I went to pay they wanted to charge the full price of the dish we had sent back. The staff was very rude.
4133;Pho Mi 99 has the worst service I have ever been to. The waitress was not welcoming and when my boyfriend and I wrote our order down on paper, she could not differentiate the number 7 and the letter T. When she asked if we wrote T, we clearly said no, its number 7. So she left and came back after some time with the wrong order and said it's order #T08 instead of #708. She then accused us of saying that we told her T. We also had a "Take-out" order where the letter T was clearly written on it. We also asked for iced water and she came back with just water. We don't need or expect people in the service industry to say hi with a big smile or pretend to be interested in how we're doing... just don't accuse the customer of your error. If she just had corrected it without those comments, that would've been the end of that. We're never coming back here again because of poor service.
4134;Just terribleWe ordered take out and found a cigarette bud and filter in our chicken satay I would give this place a zero but it won't let me postEff those dirty pricks Pic attached
4135;When I ordered the fried rice with bbq pork they had the eggs shells in my food, it was not appetizing at all. Very poor service as well.
4136;This is a sorry excuse for Pho.  Viet restaurants have reached the point where there are too many that don't try anymore. Soup is bland, ingredients are cheap
4137;The first times I had the chicken pad Thai it was really good. I've now been to this location for chicken pad Thai twice since then and the pad Thai was absolutely disgusting. I don't know if they have a new cook but but pad Thai completely different. No flavor and no chicken or vegetables. Just horrible.
4138;Food was good and so was the pricing but I was very disappointed by the service. I had to ask for every single thing. I ordered the soup . It came out very quick, impressive. I also ordered an entree. Now the server didn't have enough sense to let me finish my big bowl of soup before bringing out my entree. I was just 20% done with my soup when he brought my entree. So then I started rushing through my soup coz I didn't want my entree to be sitting there getting cold. I ended up just having half the bowl of my soup so that I can start with my entree before it gets too cold. I think the server should have cared a little more. Not at all impressed. Then when my bill came, I thought he would come and collect so that he can bring me change. No one was coming so I just had to leave a 20 while the bill was 16. I didn't feel like giving a 25% tip but whatever.Overall poor , inattentive service.
4139;When I went to pay for a large drip coffee, the owner told the cashier to charge me $1 more than the posted amount. When I asked why, the owner told me it was an extra charge for a drop of Almond Milk, which was, in his words "very expensive." Apparently he didn't realize that if you blatantly rip people off, they can post reviews on the internet.
4140;***DO NOT BUY THE $50 VOUCHER DEAL ADVERTISED ON YELP!***I made the purchase and tried to use it a few days ago, and the lady behind the counter did not know what to do with it, so she called the manager, who told her that they did not post any deals on Yelp. They did not offer any explanation, reconciliation, or apology about the issue, and so I left hungry.I contacted Yelp, and they said that deals on Yelp are posted by the business owner, and are not posted by Yelp. Overall it was a poor experience, and they could've handled the issue much better.
4141;We ordered from H Bar through JustEat for delivery after reading and hearing great things about the restaurant. I got the fried cauliflower and my partner and friend each got an assortment of sliders. After a very long wait for the food it arrived cold and soggy. The cauliflower was complete mush and tasted like the fryer oil hadn't been changed in quite a while. The sliders, despite being an assortment, all tasted the same and were burnt. The menu options sounded wonderful, but none of the items we ordered seemed to be made with any care. We ended up throwing everything in the garbage after a few bites. I called to ask for a refund and spoke with one of the owners. She was very polite and open to hearing the criticism, she assured us that we would be fully refunded for the order. It has now been almost three weeks with no follow up or refund. I am as disappointed in their customer service as I was with their meal.
4142;We thought it would be a great idea to pick up a picnic basket of their gold package before our date at Trinity Bellwoods one night. The basket was cute but the contents inside were not.The roast beef had so much fat on it that only 1/8 of the portion they gave us was actually edible. The "selection of meat" consisted of that fatty roast beef that my 4-year-old daughter could have made better and chicken that was dry AF (there was only enough chicken to make one sandwich btw). The bread was rock hard. They were "out" of potato salad and did not bother making more, forcing us to change to a boring garden salad. Their "selection of cheeses" consisted of goat cheese and cheap mozzarella (who likes goat cheese anyway?) Oh and they were also "out" of the donuts and the replacement sounded so bad we opted out.Overall a great idea, but a terrible execution. I highly DO NOT recommend this place for their picnic baskets. You're better off to go to Loblaws and get your own fresh and delicious ingredients for half t
4143;update: they didn't give me my 2 pops and said they are coming back. But it's been 30 minutes. There's no driver! !      Do not order delivery! You will regret, cry, and starve. First of all, she's not gonna understand you over the phone. Secondly, they don't even deliver to your door. And. It takes them two hours to deliver! Or even longer, if they have customers in store. I don't get it. Hire a driver if you're in the delivery business.
4144;My mum came into to town so we decided to hit up a near by cultural festival and saw that they put up a stand. I was super excited and got 6 pieces of takoyaki and it was by far the worst, most disgusting food I've had. It was cold and I asked for some fresher ones and the person running the stand declined (in the rudest way possible). She wouldn't even consider it and told me she would absolutely not give me fresher ones, nor give me back my money. Not only was the food quality poor, the service that I got was completely grotesque. If I could rate less than one star, I would. I do joy recommend, unless you want to get treated like garbage.
4145;I got scowled at yesterday for ordering a drink I've ordered many times at other coffee shops (crema, dark horse cafe, balzacs ...). I mean a Double Americano in a cappuccino cup? Is that so hard?
4146;So I showed up due to the oxtail pho I read about somewhere out of curiosity 1. Oxtail pho ran out at 7pm 2. Service was very slow. 3. The broth was SALTY SALTY, both mine, my friends were salty4. We complained twice and they did nothing!! 5. At the end there is ONLY 3 tips options 15%, 20% and 25% forcing you to choose these 3!!! I said I don't want to do that and put 0%
4147;Have to second the bad review below about this place.  Biggest turn off was Pam herself.   Acted as though we had committed some type of terrible crime by walking into her establishment, being friendly, and ordering 2 roti's to go -  shame on us for doing such an awful thing!!!!Her complete distain for our patronage carried over into the food - the two tinyest and least filled roti's this city has ever seen.  What a load of crap!  Not surprised to hear her last location was a dismal failure, seems she hasn't figured out the classic rule of business:  if you make a point of treating people like s#$t, and then provide them a crap product, they will not come back ever again.Here's a mini roti heirarchy:A level - Vena's (fantastic)B level - Island thyme (very solid and with a lower price than most)C level - Jerk King (what they lack in freshness, they make up for in quantity)F level - Pam's (small boring roti, high price, nasty service)
4148;Horrible food. Never had tapa that is wet! At 10:45 am at least 3 breakfast items on the menu was out already. And the sinangag rice had burnt rice (tutong) in it. And to top it off these Filipinos having a birthday celebration sang happy birthday at the top of their lungs 10 times!!! Really you are not in Quiapo or a palengke. Have consideration for other customers who want peace while having breakfast! Geez!!! And one more thing we were told that one item we were ordering was no longer available, all gone!  Lo and behold the waitress brought it out for us. It was chicken inasal but we refused it because first we already ordered something else and second it looked like fried chicken with Frank's Red Hots on top of it. Did not look appetizing at all. And the sago gulaman tasted well water! Never again! Crossed this testaurant off my list when we go to Canada.
4149;Picked it up. Had spaghetti with meat sauce, over cooked, no flavour and thick tomato sauce. And hubby had fettuccine with shrimp garlic sauce. Also no flavour. Garlic bread tasted as if it was on stale buns. Not worth $35. Not sure how you can mess that up?? Never again.
4150;Really rude waitress. Garlic cheese bread was greasy. Alfredo sauce was thin, runny, sweet, and disgusting.  The spaghetti was bland, tasted like Ragu or Prego or something out of a jar. I complained about the alfredo, but I was told it was not that it was not good, it was my personal taste. Never again.
4151;Disgusting!  Couldn't even eat half of it. Agadashe tofu was gross, smothered in teriyaki sauce. Toro was chewy, couldn't even swallow it. Asked server to not charge me for Toro but she did anyway!! She told me she had to... What??!!! I should have just eaten at a dirty Chinese restaurant, would have been better than this crap Japanese!  Shame on this place
4152;Food is decent, but it has one of the worst service ever! The waitress was holding the chopstick paper wrapper to trash it, but when she stopped at our table because we asked for water, she accidently dropped a piece in our miso soup. She saw it, didn't apologize, didn't offer to replace the soup, and just walked away. She didn't even bring the water. We had to ask a different waitress.
4153;One of the worst Cajun places I have been to. The atmosphere, decore was very nice. Servers were not very attentive for a littlely packed place. But the food was not good at all. We only order appetiser. The Gumbo tasted out of a can' the chicken liver had no seasoning, the calamari was over cooker in a bland tomato sauce, the crab  cakes were made out of fish, and the mussels bland.
4154;I have been to N'Awlins three times and my first two experiences, sipping brandy with my boyfriend by the bar were stellar - the bar tender was a little bit rushed but I'll put that down to my personal preference.  The third time I went to N'awlins we decided to have a meal, the crowd was extremely boisterous but the band was amazing. We both ordered a vegetarian pasta dish, (the pasta was VERY al dente) and spent the night dodging dancers left and right who all but sat on our table (and food) with the heavy dancing in an extremely cramped space. Not only did our server not do anything with regards to this, she also brought me the wrong glass of wine, which having taken a while to arrive I accepted regardless. In addition to all of this they do not take debit only cash or credit, at the end we put down 100$ cash (all we had) for a 90$ bill and decided to leave the rest as tip only for the waitress to come back and rudely say "I would rather not" - Needless to say considering the mediocre experience and horr
4155;The food is really nothing special other than being "cheap" by downtown standard. That in itself should earn 3 stars. But their service was terrible, not to mention they did not accept my card saying they don't have the machine that works. But then the guy behind me used the same and they let him use it. Unbelievable.
4156;The service is very slow and wait staff doesn't pay attention to patrons especially who do not order expensive alcoholic drinks. The food was greasy and took forever to arrive. Quite expensive however to be expected as the place is classy with nice decor however the food is not great.
4157;Food is mediocre and overpriced. Stay away from apps as most of it tastes like pre-cooked and microwaved to perfection - and ones which haven't gone through that exercise, came out really oily. We were served samosa rolls which tasted like the potato mix was boiled and filled without salt or any kind of seasoning - quite un appetizing. Chilli chicken was rubbery and vegetable pakoras were oily and mostly broccoli. Will never return.
4158;Absolutely ridiculous. The food wasn't half bad but as far as the service is concerned, it is patently pathetic. This should be a part of the manual of how not to treat customers. There were 4 adults and one 2 year old child in our group. We got there at 9:15PM. By 9:30 no one had come to our table. Eventually they did and I ordered a scotch and we also placed the complete order with appetizers and the main course. The child was very hungry and we put in a request to rush the order and it was okay if they brought everything at the same time rather than waiting for us to finish the appetizers. It took about half n hour for them to get us the appetizers. During that half n hour I had been waiting for someone to ask me for a refill. Never happened. After we finished our appetizers, we were kept on waiting for our food for another half n hour. We finally got our food at 10:40 PM. Absolutely ridiculous. Eventually we got the bill and on checking the bill I realized that I had been charged $24.99 for an appetiz
4159;Where do I start.. so I've been here about 6 to 7 times now within the last 4 years. Needless to say, each time I go, I find myself less and less impressed. The food is good, with the exception of the non-Indian portion of the menu. I'm not sure if they use different chefs for Hakka because it always turns out terrible, and the chicken quality sucks. The tandoori menu however never fails to oblige. Service is very slow especially on busy days.. we had to remind the waiter we were still waiting on various items atleast 3 times. Making reservations on a busy day? Forget it, they only take walk-ins. You'll be waiting atleast an hour before getting a table. Step it up Avani.
4160;I wish I could give a zero star. We visited the restaurant today (June 18)evening. The person on the reception asked if we had reservation. We had no reservation and then he made annoying faces. And remarked that we should always come with reservation. He was rude and disrespectful. And he even offered us a table. The restaurant was fairly empty at that time. Even if they did not have a place, he could have simply said there is no space or there is a wait. After witnessing such rudeness, we opted to walk out and eat somewhere else.
4161;We had the sizzler tofu as a vegetarian starters and not to dampen anyone's spirit it had egg batter on it. That's a no no for Indian vegetarians. When an Indian restaurant prepares Thai food make sure it has all the ingredients of good Thai sauces rather than using coconut milk and a bit of coloring and calling it Thai. We had the Pad Thai and we gave it 5/10 and the Avani Thai curry was basically a coconut creamed based sauce with no hint of Thai in it. It had a many pieces of brocolli and Cauliflower and a few pieces of peppers and carrot. I ask the chef to add tofu and it was basically cut up in triangle pieces and thrown in last minute it was horrible.     I ordered the masala chai and was given a hastily prepared microwaved like tea. How disappointing. Wasting my hard earned money in this pit is a pain. How and why is this place doing business I don't know and I wish them luck only wish they have better chef.
4162;If you're trying to make a reservation for a couple hours before closing, they won't take you. Apparently, it takes 2 hours to feed their guests so if they're closing at 10, they'll stop seating at 8.I wouldn't count on any lasting success for this restaurant.
4163;A total letdown!Food - Basmati rice was inferior - seemingly microwaved and re-heated, brought to us after an inordinate amount of time (for serving rice). Dried up and tasteless. "Samosas" were a "modern" take on the classic - but fell flat, being less than enough and mostly potato! Intensely disappointing! The amount of tamarind sauce was puny and dollhouse sized! Not enough. Customer Service - Utterly clueless. Although I understand her relative newness (recent hire), the server could not answer basic questions, leaving us to consult the kitchen multiple times - and even asked -us- to tell -her- what was on the menu. A sign of lackluster training. We found a hair in our "Chicken Platter" and promptly informed the staff. Instead of listening to the claim or abiding by the "customer is always right" phrase (the hair did not match any of the customers!), the plate was taken to the kitchen and another staff member returned to inform us that there was actually NO hair on the plate! (the hair had been
4164;Food was good. Pretty nice ambiance. However, I felt discriminated being the only asian guy in here. Would probably not come back based on service.
4165;You get the smell of pungent non veg as you enter the resturant. .. nonetheless I can't say about the food as I was refused to be served coz I didn't make a reservation. It make sense to refuse if the resturant was full or there was any waiting. But there was none, it was more than 70% empty.   I had gone there around 6:30 pm and waited till 6:45 pm to see if anyone with reservation came...nobody came and I too decided not give them my business... this one resturant is off my list.
4166;Staff unfriendly. Did not greet us or smile.Waited over 10 minutes to be offered a drink.Currently still at the restaurant, will update if the service gets any better...
4167;Mine was a mixed experience. We ordered Veg Chowmein, Murgh laziz and Naans. Chowmein was really good, one of the best I have had in US and Canada. Murgh Laziz was just ok. Given the Chowmein was good, we ordered Dry Chilli Paneer but unlike Chowmein this was a total disaster! It was too sweet and lacked all other spices or the schezwan taste. I checked with the server and she said that's how it is supposed to be!! I have never had that sweet a chilli paneer. For dessert we ordered Coconut fried icecream which was another disaster, smelled of old oil and old coconut.. We ordered masala tea which came after 45 minutes and was as if they made it in literally under a minute. The staff is not very customer friendly either. Our server was busy setting up the tables for next day although they had more than an hour left was closing time.The one star is for the good Chowmein.
4168;Service was terrible.  We went as a group of 10 people.   When we went to pay our bill they refused to split our bill because they only had one credit card machine.  When we asked if he could split our bill and some of us would pay cash he said no. That was my third time and last time I will ever go to avani
4169;Complete wastage of money, food was horrible and my entire family was disappointed.
4170;We ordered take out from here on Friday. I finally got around to trying it early Saturday evening... It all started off great... I was praising the restaurant and making comments like "this is one of the better curries I've had" "we'll definitely have to go back". Long story short... I've been up since 3 am with the worst food poisoning of my life. (No exaggeration) We ordered the channa masala and the egg plant dish... No meat or seafood. Kind of scary and very disappointing since I had high hopes this would be a good spot. I leave for vacation Monday and I'm trying not to let this put a damper on anything but yeah I will definitely not be back
4171;Nah..didn't work for us. Gave it a try today..we had the doner kebab and it was yucky..the meat didn't look fresh and the plate was just full with rice and burghul, some salad and with just a drizzle of kebab.. overall wasn't good. I highly doubt we would try the place again:( oh and it gave my hubby food poisoning:(
4172;I would give this place negative stars if I could. Awful customer service. I wasn't happy with the butter chicken that we first ordered, so we ordered the malai kofta afterwards. When the waitress brought it over, I noticed there was a hair in it. I kindly told her that there's a hair in this and requested that she take the dish away altogether as I obviously wouldn't want it. Normally places apologize and would gladly do this AND don't even charge you for it. She answered with "I can't do that, sorry." I'm sorry, what? After we then requested for her to bring out a new dish of the malai kofta so we could actually eat what we're paying for, she said she couldn't do that either. We then replied with "You want us to pay for and eat something with hair in it?" She carelessly answered, "No, you can pack it and take it home." Aside from the awful food and even worse customer service, the final bill altogether was over $40.00 for a few pieces of naan, a watered down/flavourless butter chicken, and an untouched dish
4173;STAY AWAY.  check your bill as they will charge you for items you did not order.  Also food gave us instant food poisoning. Horrible service also
4174;Ordered delivery from the, via Uber Eats, first time using this service in Brampton and wow what a crap experience. Food was made and delivered on time but thats about all they got right. The Malai Kofta was horrible, like gross, and the Butter Chicken tasted like what I imagine it would taste like if it was made by prisoners in a supermax penitentiary by people who've never eaten the dish before. Just so bland. Ordered Garlic Naan and Tandoori rotis, both tasted bad and were soggy and I've eaten store bought naan that tasted better. Kuchumber salad was basically a box filled with poorly chopped carrots and onions, really bland and boring, not what I was expecting at all.All in all place was a serious let down so avoid at all costs as there are hundreds of decent Indian joints in Brampton but you should never order form this place unless you have no idea what good India food is supposed to taste like, then maybe you might like it. Otherwise you'd be safer with fast food.
4175;This update is long overdue. I came here over the summer, so I'm posting this quite late.This is an update on my last visit and it was terrible. I went in a small group, no more than 6 people. Service was really bad, not very polite. The lady served us our food with a very unpleasant grin. At the time I was hungry and didn't want to let that bother me. The quality of the food remained consistent, just not the attitude. We finished our food and just decided to stay for a little to catch up. The lady had the balls to hand us our bill a few minutes after we finished eating.. At this point, I was furious (in my head). I didn't want to make a scene bc my friends were with me. I'm sure they felt the vibe I put out.. Luckily for the server, I didn't pay. If I did, I wouldn't have tipped. But thanks to this experience, I now visit other Vietnamese restaurants around town. I'm happy to say that there are other places that have Vietnamese food just as good or better, WITHOUT the attitude. Haven't been back since su
4176;Service/environment left me feeling uncomfortable and unwelcome. We came on a Monday evening, and during our 1.5hr stay, we were the only customers. The one waitress working didn't greet us, smile, say thank you, awkwardly approached us and left me feeling as if we weren't supposed to be there. During the time we were eating, she sat behind the bar and seemed miserable to be there. The restaurant was cold and turned off the lights to the basement where the washrooms were, it seemed as if they were trying to save on the energy costs regardless of the modern decor. Food was pleasant but I would not return here due to the ambiance.
4177;We passed by this restaurant often and were curious. We are very familiar with Hungarian cuisine. I took the initiation to read reviews and were excited to try it.To our disappointment, the following is our dinner experience.Pros:- The restaurant is cute, warm and very clean.- Our waitress was very sweet and welcoming.Cons:- We ordered Goulash Soup to start with. It was blunt, we had to put chilly flakes in order to eat it.- The Chicken Paprikash was flavourless and salty, rather nasty.- The Meat Loaf was absolutely horrific. It was deep fried to close to black, very very dry, extremely salty and greasy. I didn't taste much except for 1 cup of salt and grease. - The Mushroom stew was almost pickled in salt. There is more salt in the dish than the actual veggie ingredients. As for flavour, there was none.We kindly gave the owner feedback regarding the salt content of the food. She wasn't pleased to listen nor appeared to care. We really wanted to like this place. We feel scammed and lied to by th
4178;The décor of this restaurant was adorable. The waitress was hospitable. The food was flavourless, greasy and salty to an unimaginable degree. If you're used to a greasy KFC diet, your stomach now has a new challenge. We had a pitcher of water to wash things down and later wished we didn't as I had a sleepless night of tummy growling.
4179;Was here with my friends and I should say that this place is really disappointing. I order borsch, sashlyk, plov, olivie and kvass. The borsch was very salty without meat and the price was 8$ what is pretty high for the small plate! Plov was made with the indian spices which is absolutely abnormal for a ukrainian/russian style of this rice! This fact really disappoint me, because I know how hard it is to find ukrainian spices here in Toronto, and I was assuming to have some good ukrainian food at that place, but.. When it comes to kvass, i drink half of it and later on found out that there is a fruit fly in my cup. I called the waiter (it takes him 15min to notice that we were calling him) and told him to change my drink and his question killed me when he said how do I want him to fill, just a half of the cup? I think if there is smth in the cup, he should surely change to the absolutely full one without questions! He didn't even say sorry! The only good food was sashlyk (russian style of barbecue) and olivie
4180;I went yesterday for Nuit Blanche with a friend of mine. Actually, we tried to go in. It was 9:45pm and apparently this place is open until 11pm on Saturdays. The waiter told us that they were closed when we went in at 9:45pm. What a letdown! You just lost 2 potential customers who will most likely never try to go eat there again. It's a pity cause I was looking forward to checking it out but the really bad customer service on the part of that waiter for lying to us really just made all the enthusiasm for it disappear! I will definitely check out other crepe places in the area, but not CrepesClub, thanks for NOTHING!
4181;wish i could give this place more stars for their great servicebut the dark chocolate & strawberries crepe was not good crepe itself had a thick batter so it was rubbery to chew on the strawberries were also souri left half the plate unfinishedmaybe i came on an off day since the other reviews are so high
4182;Ordered a crepe from uberEATS and the crepe is BURNT. I can't imagine you serve burnt crepes to customers! Very disappointed!!
4183;I have loved this place for a long time. I eat there at least three times a month as I live in the area - but this is the last time I go. I ordered butter chicken, which I always order and am incredibly satisfied with, but this time my order was INCREDIBLY SALTY. Like unbearably so. I tried to add sugar, lemon juice, yogurt, ANYTHING to get rid of the saltiness, but nothing would help. This is the second time this has happened, but I wrote the first time off. I called them the next day to rectify the issue. I would've been fine with a new plate of food or a refund - even an apology would've been nice. The guy who answered the phone was not the manager but stated that he is in charge while the owner isn't there. I told him my story and he stated that "The food is always made the same way with the same amount of salt and the flavor I'm experiencing is probably just my taste". I told him I've made MANY MANY orders of butter chicken in the past and this has happened one other time but this is the first time I
4184;Have always been impressed with the roti shell but fillings are hit and miss and absolutely horrible guest experience tonight. Husband waited in line and placed an order at 7:32pm for 1 chicken biryani, 1 veg roti w/paneer, 1 chicken tikka masala roti w/ paneer - $44 .  He paid and waited. And waited.  After 25 minutes (this is a walk up takeout counter), he simply asked them to cancel the order and give him a refund which they refused saying the food was already being cooked.  They offered him a credit, which tells me that it wasn't a big deal that he was cancelling, but refused to issue a refund.  It's almost another 15 minutes before he gets his 3 meals.  I called to follow up with guy who said his name was Sam and he said he wasn't authorized to give refunds.  It is ridiculous to make anyone wait 40 minutes for a takeout counter roti and refuse (or not authorize your staff to give) refunds.
4185;So me and a few friends decided to order food from this place, for them to bring it to us at work. we ordered a total of close to 100 dollars in food from their website, after which we were prompted that there is a 75 minute waiting time for the food (they have an order tracking system which is a huge farce). After close to 90 minutes we give them a call, and they say we never received your order!After that we asked for compensation having waited an hour and a half for our order and the manager was very rude and said we wont get compensation since the issue was from their website and not them. Seemingly he doesn't understand unfortunately that the issue does stem from them and not us. After close to 2 and a half hours and numerous calls to which we were very rudely treated we finally got our food. The food wasn't what even close to worth the ordering price, let alone the hassle required to get the food. To summarize: Horrible horrible horrible service, very run of the mill food, expensive. I would steer
4186;I've seen this place a few times biking down by Harbourfront and always wanted to try it. Yesterday I had that opportunity and boy was I disappointed. I order my usual whenever I go to any Indian place spicy butter chicken roti. Where should I start:1. The roti was too thin and flimsy - it couldn't hold the sauce.2. Butter chicken sauce tasted too creamy.3. The consistency of the sauce was almost like a soup.4. I asked for the hottest and I got sriracha level hot - I was expecting more from an Indian place.5. Even with all that sauce in the roti, I don't know how they managed to keep the chicken so dry.I'll be sticking with my go to spot, Gandhi Indian Cuisine. That place never fails me.
4187;I am deeply disappointed by this restaurant and their service. We have waited around three hours for our food to get delivered and on top of that, we were treated in a very rude manner. I can't believe that this restaurant is actually open and operating with such a low quality service.If the manager is reading this now, please work on getting you and your team some customer service courses/classes (customer service 101 will really help) because you really really really need it.
4188;This place has gone down the tubes. Ordered an aloo gobi (cauliflower and potato) roti and it tasted like Chef boyardee sauce with heat. The roti was nothing more than a stale, soggy tortilla. Yuck. Never again.
4189;I would never recommend ANYONE get food from here. They have the most despicably bad customer service - paid $30+ for food and $3 for delivery and never received my order and when I called, not only was I yelled at by the person working there, they demanded that I repay the delivery fee (for a restaurant less than a 5 minute drive from my house). As this whole thing took 2 HOURS, I asked for a refund and they blatantly refused even though they still had my food at the store. There are 100 better Indian restaurants in the area - absolutely no need to go to a place with such deceitful practices. So completely disgusting and disrespectful.
4190;This place is right downstairs from where I live. Their Roti was good but I am no longer returning because of the way they treat their customers. I stood in line for 20 mins to order my food, which took another 20 minute to make and another 10 mins in line to pick up. I specifically asked for mild and the end product I got was the most spicy version. The box clearly labelled spicy and the guy crossed it out and wrote mild on top. Who was he fooling? I go back to the shop to inform them of this mix up. The guy at the counter told me someone was going to call me the next day to provide a full refund of my food. Heard nothing even to this day. Terrible service and I can't stand a business that doesn't keep its promises. Never again!
4191;Not worth. As name suggest roti house but instead of roti we got rumali roti made of maida. It's disappointing. Also, malai kofta was full of spice. Test wise it's OK.
4192;Ok, so let me clarify, the one star is not for the food. The food is delicious, best Indian I've had in Toronto so far.Order no. 5751, ordered on Sunday, Feb 5 2017. Total bill came up to $30, to be paid in cash on delivery. The delivery guy decides to show up without any change. I only had two 20s for him, and the guy decides to accept a big fat $10 tip! When I call the restaurant to complain, they said they will look into it and call me back. No one did. I called again on Feb 9 to ask for an update I was told the delivery is outsourced and that they can be of no help. Best customer service ever!I ordered again on Feb 9, and this time I paid by card in advance. No more trusting these guys again.
4193;Really bad taste. Also the wrap was so inconvenient to eat. The filling inside was not dry and made the food messy. Also I felt sick whole day because of spices and so much oil used.
4194;On work assignment and my second visit to Toronto, local colleagues took me to Yonge street. We were so hungry and exhausted, dropped in at this cute looking small Kabob place, we were the only guests there. I ordered the priciest item on menu 2 types of kabob (Koobideh and Barj /flet mignon combo) . Three entrees were on our table in less than 5 minutes, we were surprised at how fast the filets were done. Both meat were dry and rather cold ( ground beef and flet skewer), felt very old & hard to chew, politely told the lady waitress ( owner?) that the Barj was cold & too chewy, she offered to microwave it for me!!!!  I said, I  would try to eat one   kabob as though ordered a single kabob vs two (since I did not want microwave food  without saying it to her)..... She smiled. My companion mentioned that his stew did not taste right. She told us that she had been serving that to customers all day. Three of us basically left our plates untouched . A man ( possibly the husband) came out of the kitchen and sat a
4195;I ordered take out and it was very disappointing. Both the masto khiar and shirazi salad were completely tasteless. They could do a much better job, like adding some flavor (salt!) and lemon juice for the salad. Additionally, the koobideh was very dry.
4196;I went there yesterday with a friend of mine. I ordered a barg kabab and shirazi salad and asked the waitress to substitute the rice with zereshk polo. When she came with the food she said they forgot to substitute the rice and brought me a cup of zereshk (a sort of red sour berry) to add to my rice. I thought the zereshk was uncooked at first but she told me it's cooked. The kabab was so old that my fork nearly broke in it. It was really dry and it was obvious that it's days old. When she came to ask how the food is I was direct and told my honest opinion. She asked if I want something else instead but I just couldn't stand being there anymore so I decline. They deducted a salad from our bill. The waitress was a real lady for doing this, but I have a problem with their cook. This experience taught me a lesson: never go there again!
4197;Ripped me Off. Took US $ said its equivalent to Canadian $ they charged me extra. They didn't want to take my US credit card. Worse Biryani I ever ate and it seemed Rasmalie had baby powder to make it creamer. Will not be returning.
4198;It's apparent that somehow my experience here differs drastically from others. I don't now where I or the King went wrong but somehow things just didn't work out. Perhaps I was a little late to the game or maybe my expectations were way too high or maybe we just didn't understand each other.The samosa's are fresh! And....that's about it. The crust tastes great but the filling definitely needs some work (or maybe just a bit more of it). To plainly put it, I've had much better and I've definitely had much worst. As of the rest of the other stuff I am not sure why anyone would want to eat. The biryani is wrong(I know, I know it's an Indian joint but I was craving it that night!), chicken tika is strange and curry chicken is....just confusing. The paneer marsala is paneer-less. Ironically, the only saving grace is something that's not even inheritantly Indian -- butter chicken and even that was subpar. One thing they do have in common though is that they are all salty like the ocean. I can't comment on the swee
4199;RIPOFF! Stay away!!!- Terrible service.- Food is cold.- Cash only but only states that at the end of the line.- I paid for samosas but never got any.- Worst way to staff a business. Understaffed and then create a long line for orders. People need to wait forever.- No names of items in the display case. You need to go all the way to the to come back all the way to the front to be able to order.- Staff doesn't know the names of the items and can't be bothered to ask for help.All in all, a huge ripoff!!!
4200;The take out food was poor. Barely any chicken in the butter chicken, cartridge in the chicken fried rice, not enough meat all around in the meat dishes. Chicken samosas were cold, and the roti was too oily and thick. Customer service was poor as the staff didn't seem like they wanted to help or explain what certain items were. Overall only go here for the vegetarian samosas which are 5 for a $1 otherwise don't bother. Very over rated.
4201;This place is extremely overhyped. I was here and saw the huge line, so it seems they have some people who think their food is worth this gigantic wait.They are pretty cheap, which might be a reason why people like them, but everything from them tasted pretty bad. Their samosas were bready and didn't have a satisfying crunch as seen from other samosas I have tasted. They were out of meat and chana (chickpea) samosas, but I was able to try the veggie samosas, which were priced at 5 for $1.00. (Which is pretty cheap) They were ok, and had a nice spicy taste. I was also able to try their $0.50 plain roti, which tasted similarily to naan.The goat curry was spicy and decent overall. I did bite into cardamom when eating it, leaving an overpowering taste in my mouth.This place was disappointing on multiple levels, even with the better than average pricing.
4202;Sucks soooo much for bulk party orders!!! You can't call in orders. I waited 1 hr. for 300 samosas. They wouldn't take orders even if you were in line waiting until u got to the register. I waited 20 mins just in line. Would have walked right out if it werent for a charity event. Worse customer service and they would look at their customers in disgust when asking simple questions on timing. Ridiculous!!  Losing a big customer for this one incident and I will spread the word corporately. There are other providers just as good out there. With bettercustomer service!
4203;The horrible place to take your family.The people working there can't speak english. I asked if they could warm up my food for which a guy working there bluntly said 'NO'.I was taken aback by his response so I asked 'sorry, why no'? , the guy says microwave not working broken'.. I would have agreed if he said in a polite way or atleast explained the situation.  Come on , customer serive obviously matters.  When I realised he lied about microwave i went to his colleague who offered to warm up my food the first guy came running to the second guy and prompted him not to warm and said ' microwave stopped working I told her'. Then the other guy was a little surprised and gave my food back.  It was very obvious to the people standing there that first guy ran to the second guy just to save his big ass when I realise that was a lie from second guy.   And food is all oily and someone working next door told me that it is not fresh and please don't  buy because he had stomach upset after dining at samosa king. Beware 
4204;Went to this joint, looks clean and lots of choices, takeout only.The food was cheap but not very tasty or fresh.Got the butter chicken and rice,No place to sit and eat so we got it to go. They would not even supply any plastic utincils.Also wanted to sample a small piece of a Ladoo (sweets) before buying, they would not offer me a free sample. So I bought a sample for 50 cents, wasn't impressed with the taste.I've eaten a lot of indian food(I am of Indian origin) and this was one of the worst.  I think you need to head out to Brampton to find good Indian food.I also think the staff could be a bit more friendlier.
4205;Just called in to place an order for dhokla worth $100 to be picked up Saturday afternoon, the man who answered told me they don't take phone orders, and to call back Saturday then they will make it, perfect buddy, now if I want it I not only have to call back but possibly wait for my order.Where can I get good dhokla?
4206;Oh my goodness guys what happened? My go-to place for samosas and Indian sweets let me down last night and made us sick.Ordered samosas for our movie date to see Jason Bourne at Cineplex, judge me if you must for sneaking in food haha, but I'm sure we've all done it before. $8.00-$12.00 on nachos, popcorn is not my thing. Grabbed a masala dosa, first time trying and headed back to the movie. Snuck in the food with no trouble, mazel tov!. However after eating the dosa and some samosas, halfway through the movie, my stomach started to disagree with me, then came the nauseousness, gassy stomach of mine that growled non-stop. Thank goodness I went to see an action movie, so no one heard the King Kong wrecking havoc in my abdomen. Couldn't finish the movie, had to find a washroom and went home to rest before I felt any worse. To dispute any doubt, I felt fine till eating from Samosa King. I don't want to have this experience again so I unfortunately won't be returning to Samosa King, exercise caution if you 
4207;Am not sure about the sweet. But in terms of Bryani,it's so disgusting.. really bad !!! Am not sure if mine was old or what! But I had the worst Indian food in my life... butter chicken is like tomato with chicken.. really really bad
4208;Unlike a lot of other poor saps, I didn't have to wait long for a table. Service was mediocre. They were trying a bit too hard. Overall, not a horrible experience. Drinks were gross. The BiG Bad Wolf I ordered (a whiskey drink) tasted like they dumped a half bottle of liquid smoke in it.Overall, totally hyped up bar. Not worth your time.
4209;SERIOUSLY... WATCH YOUR ATTITUDE PLEASE!My friend is a huge HP fan and she has been talking about this bar for ages. However, we did not have a pleasant time here tonight. When we arrived the bar, all the tables were occupied so the four of us stood at the entrance, waiting for further instructions. But the female bartender (who definitely saw us) seem to ignore us. Few minutes later the other male tender asked us if we wanted to sit at the bar (while he was delivering drinks). Her attitude was horrible when she served us (she threw the coasters to us?!) and when my friends turned around to take some pictures and wanted to observe the place, she said "You should be sitting on the opposite side!" We were shocked! We ordered the Better Beer Pitcher to share, the drink is okay and it tastes like Yakult. After we paid, she looked at our bill and shook her head. I mean WHAT?! Seriously my friends and I felt very much disrespected from her attitude. This bartender's name starts with an N.
4210;First things first - we gave up. We arrived at the bar and looked inside and then at each other, puzzled, thinking "that's it???" It's a tiny bar that fits like 15 people at a time, with a 3 hour wait time if you reserve a spot (which I never actually got a call back for, even 5 hours later as they're still open!) And for what, exactly? The older man at the door was QUITE UNPLEASANT and accused us of being "difficult" when we politely asked if we could pull up a chair as there was a table for 4 available but we had a party of 5. We were immediately turned off and I immediately got defensive and snapped back... They serve some drinks in cauldrons etc but there's nothing actually mind blowing about this place at all. It's getting a lot of hype for its resonance with Harry potter fans but I can confidently say that there is hardly anything in this bar that has anything to do with Harry potter. Do yourself a favour and take a hard pass on this place, there are hundreds of other good bars within walking distance t
4211;This is a fandom you don't f**k with. One of the worst bar experiences in Toronto. After waiting almost 2 hours in line, we were bowled over by the sparse decor, you'll find a better Harry Potter theme in my grandma's garage. Not a place to bring your first date and then make out in full view of the lineup outside, as people will hate you forever. I strongly suspect this place was set up by someone who was a fan of the movies, or God forbid, Harry Potter Musical. The tapas tasted awful. 100% do not go, as you leave angry and disappointed. If I could give this no stars, I would. Crucio, bi**ches. Ps. The deathly hallows graffiti in the bathroom did not distract from the grime of the toilet.
4212;Colour me Unimpressed and Annoyed. The Lockhart is a tiny little place with only the vaguest of Harry Potter trappings. The servers have some really backwards idea as to what constitutes professional in terms of seating and management. Little tip for you, Lockhart. Don't do reservations in your first few months of opening. It just gums up the flow of people and makes your already stupidly long lines even dumber. My friends got their twenty minutes before I did and rather than leaving two seats of the table of four open they shoved a couple of randoms beside my friends, refused to move them, and then bold-facedly told me "Even if the two sitting beside your friends, who requested a table for four left there are people who would get in before you." I stood in line for an hour and a half just to get told that. I left after that/You want to over spend on Tapas and novelty geek beverages, go to another bar. I suggest the Black Dice, which is literally down the street. Better prices, better service, and peopl
4213;I'll totally overlook the HP theme because I knew going in it was subtle and it was, so that was expected. But the food and service were a huge problem. My boyfriend and I went around noon on a Sunday for brunch. We came in and were not acknowledged, so we sat wherever. There was a bartender and a server both on staff (and the place was not busy), but it took about 3 min to get water. Then another 5 min for one of them to come back and offer coffee. Then another 5 min to get a menu.... and in the meantime, both of the staff were putting in concentrated effort to prepare a flaming Pepsi for the kitchen staff. Awesome. We finally ordered from the limited menu only to be told that what we wanted was not available. We got grilled cheese and tomato soup and the soup was literally pureed tomatoes with no seasoning (and for $11 for a sandwich, I would expect some flavor at least). We finished our food, waited 10 min for our plates to get cleared and another 10 for the bill... and I mean there was literally 12 other 
4214;My brother and I went there for late breakfast .. food was nothing special and service was rude .. BEWARE
4215;Came in and saw a favorite of mine "slodka chwyla" instant polish warm jello. I love this stuff but when I checked the expiry date. 2014!!!!???!! So I guess all the pastries and luncheats must be from that year too.. beware of what you buy people. Go to Roncesvalles to benna's bakery instead if you want fresh unexpired food/sweets/desserts..
4216;I came to Katsuya super pumped after reading the reviews and got the carbonara katsu with cheese... it really was super delicious and filling and I was so happy and stuffed... until the next morning when I woke up with the worst case of food poisoning. Not sure if it was the two small pieces of shrimp, the sauce or the cheese.. but I regret ever coming here.
4217;One of the worst Japanese restaurants made and seems like a wanna be restaurant. The servers were extremely rude to us and the meat inside the katsu was stiff (I ordered curry katsu). I asked for new chopsticks but it took them ten minutes even after my reminders in order to get them. And also after I got my chopsticks  I found hair in my rice. It was disgusting and it is definitely not a happy atmosphere and wouldn't even dare to go back again.
4218;I was so excited to come to Edulis because of its reviews and ratings. Sadly, this restaurant was so bad that I honestly don't feel like adventuring out again. It was absolutely terrible. Outside of the staff, who were very attentive and detail oriented, this place did not work at all. We started with the hedhog mushrooms cooked in duck fat. This was good but nothing amazing. However, at this point it was a starter so I wasn't expecting amazing. It was good but nothing I can't do at home. Next came the sweetbreads over polenta. I tried the polenta plain, and it was the worst polenta I have had in my life. This is saying something since I eat out excessively. The polenta was bland...it tasted as if it was boiled in plain water with nothing else. The sweetbreads were overcooked, too crispy and had a terrible after taste. It was awful...truly truly bad. I eat a lot of sweetbreads so I am well versed in how they should be prepared and how they should taste. Next was the duck. The duck was overcooked, it was
4219;December 2016 - 5 course Menu $85Read lots of positive reviews for this restaurant, and decided to splurge a bit for a belated birthday celebration...needless to say with much regret that we will not be returning again, but let us explore why.Ambiance of the restaurant was dark and perhaps to feign a romantic setting maybe quaint is the word to describe it. To be honest, more light would be appreciated, since I wasn't able to see what I was eating. Service was awful. Miss Waitress must really hate her job because she made minimal communication with us especially when it came to explaining food (She named the dish and that was it. Also didn't help the restaurant was so loud). It was quite intimidating to see how peeved she was at us when we asked for more time to make a decision on our orders (One of us had dietary restrictions, so reviewing the ingredients is justified.) A big part of the experience is feeling valued as a customer I did not feel valued at all. Needless to say her attitude was sending 
4220;I came here with a few friends, scouting out the "best of Toronto" for friends visiting.After hearing good things from the ether, and a warning from a good friend whom I trust, I was curious to see what the "Real deal" is.My friend said they did not order any of the "pre-order" items that seem to be the house special dishes, so we ordered the chicken and 10-week aged ribeye.   The roasted and raw beet appetizer with goat cheese was executed well enough and generally good.  The special hay chicken ($70 for 2) was  nice and tender, but completely bland  and without any sort of textural contrast.   The ribeye ($90) was grilled, though quite rare throughout and completely lacking in the delicious crusting that forms through either a proper sear or grill, the beef flavor was a bit grassy but otherwise, was lacking in any 'enhancement', either form some nice Maillard chemistry on the surface or some nice salt and pepper or rosemary.  Bland again.  The accompanying au gratin potatoes were fine.    When everyon
4221;Just back from Edulis. I had to come and read the reviews again in case I was missing something...No, I was not. The food was just really bad. I can't, for the life of me understand the stellar reviews.The food was not generous to begin with. Not only in portion size but in taste. We felt we needed salt on everything. Everything tasted stingy.We had the 7 courses menu + a bottle of wine.I don't think we had 100grs of protein all together...We had a lot of vegetables...either undercooked vegetables- baby zucchinis, potato, etc., or overcooked ones- tomatoes, fava beans and green onions.We had small, and I mean magnifying glass needed, portions of fish. We had nuts and some kind of sauce on every dish.Nothing cohesive. Tastes jumped to our mouths discordantly.The pièce de résistance, the last dish, a thing of squab with onion puree tasted exactly like army food...the feeling of having had too many onions...I'm still shocked, shocked at how bad it all was.As for the service...our wine was poured way to
4222;Total rip off. This restaurant was all hype and in the end we walked out knowing we would never get that time or money back.First mistake was doing the truffle tasting menu. For $150 a head I could have spent my money better at another restaurant. Let me preface by saying I love eating out and have no problem spending money on good food. I love truffles. This was not a truffle meal to love. Truffles were only in 3 of the 7 courses and none of the courses were delicious. I kept trying to find amazing flavor but after each bite came back bland and boring. From the first course I knew we had over paid but since we were already along for the ride I wanted my moneys worth! That did not happen. Secondly, it took forever! Our reservation was at 7:30 and we didn't make it out until 10:45. And we did not loiter around, we wanted to get out of there! The service was slow and the meal dragged along in an uncomfortable way. My suggestion don't eat here.
4223;Impolite counter person, burnt food, brown edges on chopped lettuce, improper food handling, high prices for low quality food.
4224;My wife and I have been to this restaurant several dozen times and I thought I had left a review.  If so had, I would have given this restaurant a solid 4+ stars way back when.However, since my last time here some things have changed, and sadly not for the better.First off...the food is still good.However the hospitality and treatment of repeat customers has made me not want to come back.What hasn't changed: The food is still good and of good quality. The lunch menu prices haven't changed over the past two years.They still tend to not have items in stock.  My wife wanted to order the octopus/shrimp ceviche and like the last two times...it wasn't in stock (again!)What has changed:The general feeling of welcome and acceptance.  The courtesy to customers and potential customers is no longer there.Prior to this meal, the restaurant used to provide free chips while waiting/ordering. Now, there is a fee for each refill. Not being aware of this, my wife had two refills while waiting (these chips ar
4225;I had such a terrible experience. The food had absolutely no flavour and portion size is definitely not worth the money being spent. I had visited this restaurant when they opened up. Food was delicious back then and the portions were huge. Something has changed for sure.....
4226;UGHH ! Never again in life. Fries all stuck together, Fish, with lots of batter. In fact, there was hardly any fish at all, just many pieces of empty batter. Extremely greasy to boot. Couldn't figure out the long line-up outside... or the fact that the place was packed. Went during the holidays and by the afternoon they had run out of several types of fish. Don't recall any coleslaw, either, or onion rings. Shocked at the high ratings this joint gets. Horrid. Avoid at all cost.
4227;Frankly, I would not give this restaurant 1 * , but it is the lowest option.These people have no consideration for handicapped people.I was horrified at our treatment.  We went to this neighbourhood restaurant for my best friend's birthday dinner ( at her request), and she was excited to about her evening.   There was a 20 minute wait, so we ordered a drink from the bar, the 2 guys each ordered a beer, and the girls (my friend and I) decided to split a beer as we did not want to fill up before our fish and chips, as they can be quite filling.  We were then seated and put our order in.  We ordered a half litre of wine with dinner, and a short time later, the waitress came back and told us she could bring our food, but she could not serve us any alcohol, the half litre of wine.I, discreetly, asked to speak to her, to let her know that my friends husband had a brain injury and is handicapped, and that she might have misread the situation.  He walks with a limp and has a left side deficit from his stroke, and 
4228;Poor service. Food was taken away even we were not done, constantly asked if we were done even restaurant was empty, didn't pour us water, didn't give us tartar sauce...not a good experience
4229;I went there for the first time last week and all I have to say is " What's the big deal"?? What is it with all the great reviews for this place?  The fries are soggy, the fish (in the halibut fish and chips) is just greasy, too much breaded and a small piece of fish for the $13 dollars that I paid.  Just look at the pictures of other reviews here of the fish..it's so small.  In a nut shell, don't waste your time here..  there are much better places for fish and chips in the city.  Actually anywhere but here.
4230;*****This review is solely on the service I received and not for the food*******Amazing amazing fish and chips. 5/5  But the worst worst service ever. If you ever get Stacy - the Asian lady.   Not to be racist cause I am Asian.  Good luck if you ever get her. So we sat there for more than 10 mins and server didn't even come present herself.  No water no nothing!! Even other servers notice that we had no service and I heard one of them ask the bar who was in charge of us.  So finally, she showed up after her co-worker told her it is around 15 mins after getting seated.  She never once came to check up on us for the entire meal, only time she came was to take our order and bring the food.  So she didn't bring us water the entire night and we were not able to flag her down cause she didn't even give us a look.  So finally we asked another waitress for water and she is like  there is no more glasses.  But 2 mins later an older lady came and gave us 1 glass for the two of us.  Okay, so why would you bring 1 
4231;Had a reservation with Nicole M. and some friends in town from NYC, which had been made about a month prior, for 6 people at 8 pm. Left at 9 pm to go to Union as we had yet to be seated. Between 8 pm and 9 pm we stood in the "lobby" jockeying around in order to let people past to use the restroom (we didn't go to the bar because it was full of people eating, so basically there is no bar). We were given no update about what was going on until 8:20 when one of the members of our party finally asked (despite the fact we were standing no more than 3 feet from the greeter), at which point we were told it shouldn't be more than 20 additional minutes and that it wasn't their fault, but the fault of the diners who were eating too slowly. Apparently at Enoteca if your table is incredibly delayed it is not attributable to their inability to manage reservations, but instead it is the fault of their paying customers. Enoteca, if you can't work out how to time your reservations, stop taking F'ing reservations! At 8:
4232;We came here a few months after opening, and decided to wait until all of the 'kinks' of opening a new place were out before trying again. We went back again this evening and solidified our decision to not return. We were seated quickly, without a reservation, which we appreciated. We had the daily crostini, which (I'm sorry to say) tasted like well-seasoned spam. Entrees followed - a carrot mezzaluna and the rigatoni with chanterelles and pancetta. The mezzaluna was ok,  but the rigatoni, aside from having no chanterelles, was so salty from the pancetta  that my partner couldn't finish it. I should also mention that both of our wine glasses were cleared without being offered another - my partner managed to ask for another, but nothing for me! Someone came by and verbally offered the desserts, another server dropped off dessert menus and (we think) the manager took the menus away again, with a brisk 'this is wrong, we're out of panna cotta'. To top it all off, we had just decided on dessert and after-dinner d
4233;I attended a private party here a few months ago.  I waited to post a review so as not to upset the organizer of the party.I have a number of dietary restrictions due to chronic conditions and allergies.  I am not accustomed to having these restrictions met, and I don't expect them to be met either.  If a restaurant can't accomodate me, that's cool I just don't eat there.  I don't like to make a big fuss or cause problems for the kitchen staff, so I always call ahead to see what's possible before visiting a new restaurant.  I would like to emphasize again that I understand the risks of dining out with allergies, and I also appreciate that I take a risk every time I do.  I would also like to emphasize that I understand that I am probably a huge pain in the ass to cook for, so I don't expect that every restaurant will be able to do so.  But I always call ahead and check, so as not to cause undue stress or inconvenience for the kitchen staff or for my fellow diners.  And I would never go to a resaturant if th
4234;I was with Jordan T. for the 1 star experience he describes below. Mistakes and delays can happen. I can understand that. The experience was frustrating for a number of reasons, mainly Enoteca's failure to accept responsibility for the delay (they repeatedly told us it was the fault of the people still at our table). They treated us like they were doing us a favour by accommodating us over an hour after our reservation. In fairness, Enoteca sent out some prosecco (at about the 25 minute mark) and an appetizer (at about the 50 minute mark). It was a nice gesture and the appetizer was actually quite good - but the overall experience left a sour taste in my mouth. We left shortly after 9pm.
4235;Food tasted really bad! I ordered the Tandoori chicken with Afghani rice. The rice tasted horrible..they had a weird taste to it. Chicken wasn't so bad..so I just ate the chicken and left the rice. Portions were small. My friend ordered a curry and some naan... The curry tasted good. However, Some of the stuff from the menu wasn't available. The waiter had really dirty hands and fingernails which grossed me out. Also his uniform was visibly dirty. To me appearance of the staff matters and it reflects the quality of the food and service!
4236;I found the service terrible and the prices too high.  They don't even have real basmati rice for the curries only some stale gross frozen version of rice.  It was disappointing.   The food was brought out before bans so.everything was cold by the time the bans got there.  For the same money I could have gone to a nice restaurant that was efficiently run.  Also too much garlic in papri chat. It was overall one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.
4237;Food was good but now it has gone bad!! Service was always SLOW but now it's PATHETIC! If you call them 1 day ago, food will still not be ready when you go to pick up!! I was their regular customer but after terribly slow service, almost insulting! I gave up! Restaurant owners always has excuse to give for food not being ready!!
4238;Gail J you are an idiot!Did you not notice your food going in and out of the microwave.Don't be stupidThe place is a s$%t hole.The stupid old fart is rude, stands there pretending everyone is his friend.He actually pulled my pita out of my hand and opened for me.You never do that to your customers, if I wasn't such a nice guy I would have plowed him in the face.Food is crap, service is crap and the place sucksDO NOT EAT HERE!!!!
4239;Microwaved shawarma meat... is this your best effort?  Seriously.  What proud Arabic person nukes shawarma meat and serves it to the customers? Yes, as everyone said, the portion is giant here.  More so than anyone should be eating.  But then again, it might be twice the size, it is also twice the price.  Most pita sandwiches here are around the $8 mark, or about twice the price of a typical shawarma.Oh, here is the kicker too.50 cents extra for hummus? 50 cents extra for garlic sauce?75 cents extra for baba ganoush?This place is geared for the hicky white folks.  Surely only they would not be upset at this.  Unless, you know, they walked into a burger joint and the people there charged them 50 cents extra for relish.  And 50 cents extra for grainy mustard.More proof of it being geared to the local population.  You can even order a falafel with honey mustard if you want.  And next to it all, you can order a pita with ham and bacon.. in a middle eastern restaurant, run by middle eastern people.  Ag
4240;I have no idea why this place is getting such high reviews. This is not shawarma. The meat is just grilled chicken breast that is microwaved. It lacked any sort of flavour. The girl making our pita filled the whole wrap with lettuce. Like the wrap was overstuffed, falling apart and watery because of how much lettuce was in it. I can't say anything about the owner as he barely talked to us. But the food wasn't good. Plain and simple.
4241;The last time I checked Arabic's don't microwave chicken........sure its packed look at the quality of the people that live in whitby hicks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4242;Terrible service. Tried to have a nice tea afternoon but was spoiled by unattentive service just because we were only two people.
4243;This is THE WORST fish and chips place! Trust me, the oil they use is extremely old and a few seconds of the fish in the fryer will burn them black. We received super hard dark flavorless pieces of haddock and halibut and the fries are soggy and tasteless. They don't know what good fish and chips are... Go anywhere but here!!!!! Never again!
4244;If you want to eat in forget it there's no air conditioning..you'll sweat like a pig food is greasy decor is retro 50's washrooms forget it... Just another greasy spoon!
4245;Food here is barely edible, and there are a few guys who hang around the place and bother women who pass by. (I don't know for sure whether these guys are affiliated with the restaurant, but all signs point to yes.)For some reason, I don't think this is a real restaurant...
4246;Horrible service. We came into the cafe and people just left a table of four. We waited few min for it to be cleaned which is fine. We were about to sit when a group of three came in. We said they could take our table of four and my boyfriend and I can sit at another table next to another couple. My question is why did they get served first, why did they get food first and why was our order taken 15 minutes later. Doesn't matter if your short staffed which he told us half hour after, Take the order of those who came in first. Cherry ontop . we waited for our breakfast for half hour. Still the food has not come and its because the chef is looking for one of the ingredients for 20 minutes as stated by the waiter. We said its fine to leave it out and so the waiter told UA it's just few more min. Another 5 min goes by and we just had to go. All we got was a sorry.
4247;I'll be honest. I am gluten free. They didn't really help me find good options that would be safe for me on their menu. I have tried to eat there a couple of times as I'm a huge supporter of local restaurants. But they turn me away every time.
4248;Not that great or anything special.  The price is ok for what you get. I'm not sure if I'd bother coming back.The restaurant charged us for a bad cup of coffee that they served that we asked to have replaced. That is very unreasonable, we won't be back ever.
4249;This place used to be amazing.  A long time fan of the square peg, I didn't mind when they increased the price a dollar because the quality was incredible.  Something happened to this place though.  Whether it is new management or simply a matter of resting on their laurels.  The peg was changed so that basically it became a glorified soup and salad with potatoes and the service went downhill to boot.  Today I went in hungry and left starving and a little queezy.  I ordered the wanna-be peg that was to have potatoes, soup, a brownie and a chicken taco.  The soup was sour and kind of clumpy and I found a blond hair in the chicken taco and sent it back.  Waited.  Got a my new order, found another hair -this time brown.  I sent it back.  The only staff person their offered me anything on the menu for free (after the second time finding a hair!) but then walked away.  So unable to ask any questions about the variety of salads I was supposed to eat as a substitute for a meal - I left.  It is doubtful that I will r
4250;Curry Twist was a mediocre experience. The best part of the meal was the free pappadums we received on being seated. We ordered a fair amount off the small menu and were horrified by our first dish, the Tawa Paneer -  it was without a doubt the saltiest dish I have ever been served at a restaurant. Next came the rice pulao, the lamb masala and the saag paneer. The lamb masala tasted of black pepper, lacked any depth of flavour and contained very little lamb. The saag paneer was bland. The na'an was the worst I have ever eaten, it was cold, hard and crunchy. This experience was insultingly bad. The restaurant was packed, and once again I am reminded that being busy is not a good indication of quality.
4251;The Good:Nothing that I can note.The Bad:1. mediocre food2. small portion size3. burned appetizer4. pricy for what we orderedConclusion:Try Banjara at Christie.
4252;Figured I was in the area tonight so I would try something different in the area. First off I love Indian food but this take out was nothing what I expected and have had in the city. $12.95 got you no chicken (5 chunks) with LOTS OF SAUCE good customer service but with Roti it was just under $18.00. Not worth it. It's like having a soup dish.
4253;Really quite bad. I remember having curry twist several years ago and it was quite delicious - naan bread was the right combination of chewy and soft and moist and oily, curries were flavourful and fresh. But this time was markedly different. We got take-out and a couple of different curries and some naan and the curries were so insanely sweet they were inedible, we tossed them out. The naan bread resembled grocery-store-bagged pita bread. Definitely won't return.
4254;Let's just get this out:  Curry restaurants are too expensive.  Two entrees, one with only four pieces of meat (the lamb curry) a lassi, papadums, garlic naan, and two rasmalais should not add up to 50 bucks.  It is the same curry that you would get at any greasy spoon Indian place in Brampton.  They happen to have (somewhat) pleasing decor, and decent service.  At any greasy spoon curry house, you can have the same heartburn and potty issues.  However, high park eateries have to stop charging working folks 50 bucks for the same old coconut a ghee buckets.
4255;I was so excited to order from here after all of the amazing reviews. I am in disbelief at how tasteless the food was!  We ordered the butter chicken and the dal. Both dishes lacked the flavor of Indian cuisine. Both were bland and we were so incredibly disappointed. The garlic nan was the best part of our meal.  Really too bad as we live close by and thought the prices were reasonable. Maybe they had an off night?  Will still never return. Bukhara grill or Chutneys are much better options
4256;After having sat in the entry way, because a group of 3 was not acceptable to their standards we had to leave after an hour. Seeing groups of 2 or 4 go ahead, whilst we were on the list way ahead of them they informed us that there was only one table for 3 people and we would simply have to wait. After spending $50 on three glasses of wine and seeing a former colleague being served free cocktails and being seated ahead of us - it was insulting and embarrassing. I'm fairly certain there was racial bias involved. 3 people is an odd number but when hosting a friend from out of town and being treated so poorly, it does not reflect well on Toronto, Gio Rana's or us. Thanks for nothing.
4257;The ambiance is messy and dirty, literally you can look up and see the dust on the vents and fans. The place is not even painted properly. I thought they were under construction, but apparently 'that's their style'. It's tacky in a dirty way, not in a fun hipster way. The tables are super small, that you have to literally stack plates to eat. The tables are also really close to each other, that the waiters will hit your chair at least a few times a night. The waiters are dressed casually, but not in a preppy way or even in a hipster way, just in a 'homeless man' way. The music is terrible. It's super loud. They play the crappy stuff on top 40. The service is alright, I mean you do get your food - if that's your standard. Some things I asked the waiter to bring never show up. They just leave the pitcher of water on your table for you to serve yourself. It took a lot for me to get the waiters attention, at least 6 tries calling him over. The food is not good. You can eat it. If that's your standard. For s
4258;This is a 0/5 rating.The staff are inattentive and pretentious. We were greeted by waiter Y, he took our order and spent the entire night at a couple's table while waiter A brought us our food, drinks, and dessert and checked up on us once. Waiter Y only returned to collect the bill/his tip.The food was incredibly disappointing.Meatball app = 1/5, pre-madeGnocchi = 0/5, bland and coldRisotto = 0/5, unappetizing as it was a dark brown, no taste, and it was already separating as it arrived, pre-madeChicken Breast = 1/5The food/service resonates with the theme/decor of their restaurant - incomplete, half-a**, and 'meh'.Save your money, time, and the disappointment and go to any other Italian restaurant.
4259;Horrible experience! Went there looking at Yelp reviews but the food was pathetic. We ordered the chaat papri, mixed chicken platter and hot & sour soup. The chaat was overly sweet and full of brown sweet chutney. The chicken marination had no taste. The hot and sour soup was too bland - we had to add vinegar & chillies to it and then all we could taste was vinegar & chilly. Although the staff was courteous and offered us 10% discount for the next visit - we were not happy to hear that they had been busy the whole day delivering a big order outside and hence, they couldn't live upto our expectations. That is not something customers should have to put up with.
4260;The guy running the shop made fun of my mustache (I have trouble growing out my mustache). I was there for about 20 minutes before he kicked me out for "totally killing the vibe with my whack stache".
4261;Even though I live around the block I'm never coming back here.Went in to grab one of those overpriced cold press juices they have. I buy it on debit and leave.I shake the bottle and all these moldy specks appear I keep shaking and they don't disappear. Expiration date is two days ago. Apparently pulling rotten inventory from the fridge is not a priority here. Upon returning, the staff:A. Don't know how to refund debit purchases at first and spend a few minutes texting for help. B. Eventually attempt to refund me the charged amount and not my 15% tip (I'll never again tip for a bottled beverage purchase EVER at a cafe again).C. Very likely didn't refund me correctly since the refund amount hasn't appeared on my bank statement. EDIT: Hours later and no refund, which means they 100% straight up took my money for free.So go to Tokyo Smoke if you want to have to inspect expiry dates with zero confidence that anyone here gives a crap either way, or only bring cash knowing full-well getting a debit re
4262;Terrible staff was ignored when I first entered and the place was empty!!! I started to touch the merchandise for attention. Finally got "the can I help you" from the owner. He showed me some sweatpants and a cannabis grinder. The merchandise was very poor quality everything was black and had a red oblong dot on it. I Kicked the tires on some overpriced metal drug pipes. The pipes looked like someone crushed a car exhaust with a forklift and then proceeded to drill 3 holes into it I said goodbye and left to find a heady.
4263;Called Sat. they said they were closed for delivery. Said the next day they were open for delivery was Monday. I just called. They said no delivery except Wed. to Fri. I don't care how good they claim to be,  there are other fish and chip joints that are reliable such as Olde Yorke. The last time I ate at Duckworth's it  was 10 years ago and it was meh anyway (too greasy and tables were sticky).
4264;Extremely disappointing.  Went here because of the reviews but were very disappointed.  Both of us had the shitake clams tempura and the collard greens.  The tempura was not crisp and hot.  I even had some raw batter on my shitake.  The collards were too undercooked, not salted and tasteless.  Both of these could have been wonderful but were rubbish.  Won't be going back.  I used to be vegan for six years and cooked much better food without seitan, soy, tofu, tempeh etc.  Not sure why these restaurants cannot make better food.  Service was fine.
4265;They should change their name to The Hogtown Unvegan or take "Vegan" out of the name completely.Let me explain.This used to be one of my favourite places, and it seemed like it was getting progressively better over the first year it was open. But from there, the food was way less consistent (over/undercooked fries, big variation in portions, and even burned veggie burgers!). And more importantly, the customer service proved to be just horrible. My friends and family were really good, loyal customers, and without any explanation they basically just froze us out when we pointed out that an item on their menu that we had independently known to be non-vegan, even though they'd previously encouraged this type of feedback. So weird! If that's how they treated us, after all of the support we gave that business, I think that speaks volumes about how they view their customers and the legitimacy of their "vegan" business.I'll never be going back to Hogtown unless something significant changes at the management 
4266;Simply the worst first experience ever. I just moved to the neighbourhood and I asked my neighbour if there is a good vegan restaurant and she was like "go to Hogtown, I've never been there but I hear it is a very nice place". Right at the entrance there was a sign that warned "Please wait to be seated, booths are for parties and groups" or something to that effect. So trying to be modest, even though the place was half empty, I stood by the notice for 15 good minutes and no one noticed I was standing there. Something makes me think may be because I am Black. After waiting for 15 minutes a young woman comes to the counter and calls on me, "excuse me a table for just one tonight?" First, I thought it was a dream, finally someone is talking to me but behind a counter when the notice suggests someone would come and show a customer to tye seat. Just the gesture irked me and I excused myself and said, "thank you but I'll go elsewhere". My advise: put up a notice that reads, BLACKS ARE NOT WELCOME.
4267;Good idea for a vegan restaurant, BUT very bland and tasteless. The idea is achieved much more elegantly across the street at Disgraceland. It's similar to the food I made in high-school when I didn't know how to make good vegetarian food. Won't go back. Overpriced garbage.
4268;Unfortunately, I don't have many positive things to say about Hogtown Vegan.The space isn't particularly clean or nice. The tables are wobbly. The prices are high, particularly given the location. Not good.The menu consists almost entirely of thrown-together mixtures of mock meats and faux cheeses, almost all of which are store bought. Almost everything is fried. The cooking is also really inconsistent. (Burnt fries and an undercooked patty are common partners!) And the few items that are made in-house tend to be poorly seasoned. Also not good.I also have it on good authority, from a number of people I trust, that the restaurant is not careful about ensuring that they have no items on the menu with animal-based ingredients. So vegans should be mindful. (I encourage you to ask questions.)The servers have sometimes been friendly in the past. So I almost want to give a star for that. But even that has been inconsistent.Not good.
4269;I live in the neighbourhood and have passed this place a number of times, but not being vegan nor thinking that 'unchicken' sounds particularly appealing have not ventured in. I went for the first time yesterday and left with what I can only describe as a mild case of food poisoning. I had the Hogtown Burger with a side of Mac and Cheese, and I'm fairly sure it was the mac and cheese that did it. I like to think that I have a hardy stomach, but when I got to the bottom of the bowl and saw about 2cm of orange grease I knew I had made a mistake.In short, if you're in the neighbourhood and want good vegan food that isn't some outlandish combination of tofu/meat substitutes masquerading as soul food then go to Banjara, which is basically right next door. I will never understand this obsession that vegans have with eating meat-like foods. Veggies are delicious in their own right, and I'd rather have a bowl of roast brocolli than tofu drenched in soy cheese.
4270;I'm sad to have to write this review. I liked this place tasty food, and cool atmosphere. Unfortunately, the last time I went there (it was my second visit--my first visit was great!), was rather unpleasant. The food was  good, comfort food made vegan=yum. But, then, cockroaches!!!! Ugh. Very upsetting. The couple next to me got up and left, and I saw movement out of the corner of my eye right after they left. There were 4 or 5 large cockroaches scuttling around the floor vent right under the table next to us. LARGE cockroaches. Seriously. When we mentioned it to the waitress, she brushed it off, saying they "get sprayed weekly, but, you know, it happens". She wasn't very understanding or disturbed by the situation. I found that rather disconcerting. She didn't offer to discount the bill, despite seeing the group of cockroaches sitting there. Sadly, I will never go back. If she had been as horrified as I was, then I would feel more at ease going back, but she really didn't seem to be concerned...very tro
4271;There has been  quite a few occasions that I have wanted to leave my meal at Hogtown due to really horrible service that ruined their amazing vegan food. Today for brunch, I didn't even get a chance to order before their unwelcoming service upset us so much that we actually did leave before eating. Their food is amazing but is completely ruined by the hostile service of several employees. We opted for Disgraceland's vegan brunch when we left Hogtown - way friendlier service...by a mile.
4272;I have reviewed Hog Town before and every time I go it seems to get worse. I love that there is a vegan spot like Hog Town but to be honest there is no consistency at all. Every time you go things taste different, cooked different, and even their "chicken" has changed now for the worse. The atmosphere is not great... matter of fact it's actually not a good atmosphere at all. The music is horrible.The staff wipes the chairs and then the tables with the same exact cloth... that CANNOT be sanitary whatsoever! I have stopped going to Hog Town all together at this point because I find myself paying for food that I don't eat because it just isn't good.
4273;My partner insisted on not going here (the menu looks like a lot of stuff targeted at unhealthy vegetarians) but when Nazareth was closed one day I went to Hogtown out of curiosity. I just found a severe lack of real (fresh) food here - definitely felt terrible after eating some of the appetizers. I ordered a ceasar and that was also not very good. Sorry Hogtown!
4274;2 of us walked in off the street for dinner, and were told to wait for a table even though there was one free. We waited for 10 minutes and walked out. I can only assume they were saving the table until a group of 4 came along. Won't be going back here!
4275;This used to be my favourite vegan restaurant in the city. This last visit was horrible. To begin, the service was so slow. For a busy Sunday, they should have more people working the dinner rush. We ordered "wings" to begin and then I ordered the Reuben sandwich and upgraded to Ceasar salad and my husband ordered the Philly Cheese steak. When I took a bite of my salad I ate a crouton that tasted like moldy bread. I asked my husband to try one to see if it was just me and he gagged, confirming my experience. When I was finally able to flag down a server, she took the plate back to the kitchen. Instead of an apology, a kitchen worker came out with my plate and demanded that I show her the mold. I said I couldn't see it (the crouton was covered in spice) but I could taste it. I invited her to try one. She went back to the kitchen and came back to lecture me how it was a spice they use and "one in a thousand people" think it tastes like mold...etc. She didn't apologise but said she could take the croutons off 
4276;I really like the premise of an American-greasy-spoon-style vegan restaurant. Guy Fieri would be proud. That's awesome.What's not-so-awesome is that I've noticed, and confirmed with questioning, that the unchicken that everyone is raving about, and every chicken product on the Hogtown menu, is an institutional, cafeteria-style breaded veggie chicken burger patty cut into chunks and deep fried. Sometimes rebattered and deep-fried. Some of the sausage/beef menu options are also made from institutionally prepared commercial patties chopped up/battered, deep fried, and served. Come on, I think that this restaurant owes itself and everyone who eats there more than that. if all they're doing otherwise is punching fries and steaming greens, you'd think they'd be able to at least make some in house vegan 'meats'.The reality is, a lot of the stuff that's offered on the menu is processed, factory made food (Daiya cheese).It's a vegan McDonalds for fecksake, right down to the assembly (and quality) of the food. I'
4277;It had 'vegan' in the title so it was suggested (while I appreciate the attempt, there is a little more depth to culinary choices even when with a high-maintenance eater).I left wishing there was more to the menu. Good location, but the vegan diner is not my taste so what others might love was lost on me. I had a salad of some description, sadly just on romaine. Other dishes seemed lack-luster too. Note: cash only, come prepared or use the ATM machine on site. End of story: no inspiration for a return visit. Also, I'm the wrong audience for it.
4278;It's not the fact that you are terribly understaffed every time I come in, or that the food is salty as heck. It's not the fact that I sat there on August 9th, 2015 at 7:15pm for 15 minutes, 10 of those without a menu, (still ok. You were busy) but that you took the order of a couple that was there for 5 minutes BEFORE you took mine. THAT'S why I left pissed off and out of my mind with anger. I wish you guys could get it together there. I feel bad for the servers because either a) you are perpetually understaffed or b) it's your first gig and are just inefficient. Either way, something needs to be done.
4279;There was nowhere to sit (there are only two tables) and girls that work here were so rude we were nervous to even ask for a to go box. Won't be returning.
4280;So bad. Unhealthy and bland. Both our meals were artificial tasting and greasy. Vegan food definitely doesn't mean healthy, quite the opposite!
4281;Honestly its pretty bad with some pretty rude management. Maybe this is a nice place for someone that is new to vegan eating, forced into a vegan diet or as a compromise for vegan eaters to bring their meat loving family. Only one item on the menu isnt pretending to be meat or cheese. (The blt and only because they use thin tofu for bacon instead of a fo bacon) and they are really insistent that it can only be served at brunch. I even offered to pay full burger price and just have a burger with the same tofu bacon but no patty and was just insulted for the sugesstion. Having takin people here a couple times I've observed a terrible attitude in general with any substitutions etc. There is no tastable love in their food. No joy for their own ingredients and what countless tastey delights they could make that arnt pretending to be meat. Id rather eat real meat than their burger that tries too hard to be like real meat. They could at least have a bean burger or a mushroom burger. What is even the point of being
4282;Made the mistake of ordering the beaver bites. I saw that the bites were not made fresh to order but were only reheated in the oil. My order came out oily and soggyI'll just stick to the traditional beaver tails next time
4283;Ordered a pizza for delivery at 8:30pm since we had guests over. They said it would arrive in 30min. The location was literally 2km away. They asked for our number in case of anything and we fully gave our address and directions on how to get to our location. 9:44 no call or pizza. We call back they said he's on his way and that when he arrives call us back to get a discount. 10pm. Still nothing. Call at 10:10 to cancel. Our guests left. 10:25pm they call back asking us to "open our FaceTime" and that they were on our street. Poor customer service. Poor communication within their establishment. And no appologizes from the establishment what so ever. Very unprofessional. Extremely disappointing. Would rank 0/5 if possible.
4284;Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat the heck is going on here? When I first tried it a year ago I loved it. Yes, the service was incredibly slow. We were in a huge group though, so we didn't really notice it. Every subsequent visit was slow. During my last visit, they took a whopping 2 hours to get us our aps. Then they forgot about our mains and asked us if we'd like the bill. 3 hours later we were out of there. No joke.My interpretation of this is tasty food but consistently severely understaffed.If you go there, try the rolls and get the black rice on your rolls. I miss the black rice, but I can't go back there. Fat pregnant lady is not happy.
4285;Argh. I don't think I've ever written a review before but I feel a huge urge to do so.  This places annoys me. The first time I went, the food was great, terrible service. I live around the corner so I tried calling a few months ago to order take out, but they didn't answer the phone, so I walked there to an empty restaurant and had to sit and wait for my order. Tonight I tried again, they kept answering and hanging up. So my boyfriend walked there, there was only 4 tables, and they said they were too busy for take out. So he said there is only 4 tables, and loads of empty spots, can we come and dine in? They said okay take out. But it will take 30 minutes? For Thai food? And sushi? Two meals. So he walked back 30 minutes later. The curry is usually decent, tonight it had no flavour and barely any sauce, so I basixally  ate dry rice, with vegetables. That was my last time. I don't understand how they are still open when 4 tables overwhelmed them too much to even answer their phone. Do yourself a favour ppl an
4286;If you are hungry. Don't bother.  The service is very slow and there are far better places just next door.I came because I love sushi and while there are so many amazing restaurants on ossington, I figured it would be nice to see how this one stands up. Not worth it. The prices are obscenely high and the portions are tiny, not fresh and the staff is less than friendly.
4287;This place is a joke - we have been sitting here for an hour and still haven't received our appetizers. Yes I am sitting here writing this review and I can see that the servers are in the weeds. I wish that we had just walked down a few more steps and gone to any other restaurant on ossington. Its Saturday night and you expect these guys to be fully staffed. I should just pay for my saki and walk out. Don't fall for the reviews here. Review written and no sign of appetizers.Update - food finally arrived and our order trickled in for the next 30 minutes. I finally found out why - there was one person preparing food for 12 tables (about 50 people) - that's a little crazy for a busy Saturday night. Food was actually good and on par with decent sushi places around town. Was it extraordinary..nope...will I be back...not a chance.
4288;Made reservations several days in advance, on a Thursday. The restaurant was not busy. We arrived on time for our reservation and were seated promptly and given menus. We waited for 1/2 an hour before leaving. During that 1/2 hour, we were not acknowledged, we were not offered any drinks and we were not communicated with regarding a delay in service. We were only acknowledged when we got up to leave, and asked 'is there a problem'? WORST SERVICE ever.
4289;Came here for a friend's birthday with a party about 20. It was about 6:30pm and the restaurant was happy empty. As soon as we walked in there was no one to greet us so we sat ourselves at the second table assigned to our group. As we were ready to order it took a few times to flag the waiter down. Clearly they didn't have enough workers to handle our group and other patrons. We ordered a few martinis and then our food: Beef short ribs, tom yum soup and a dragon roll. The soup tasted decent, full of flavour and spice. We waited about 20 mins for our main entree the short ribs which didn't taste $27 quality worth. The ribs were dry and lacked flavour. Also the purple rice it came with tasted u undercooked. The presentation was also lacking on this dish. For a $27 dish, I expected it to look flawless. After we finished this dish, I still haven't received my dragon roll and so 30mins later it came. This was probably the worst dragon roll i've ever had. Usually speciality rolls come in 8pcs but 5 pcs for $14?! 
4290;The food here is decent, however they have a completely false menu on their website which does not report the prices which they actually charge. They charged me more than double the price on their site, and I paid thinking I had misunderstood what I read. I checked when I got back home, but there was no mistaking it - they charged more than $20 for something which is only $9 on the menu. I have tried repeatedly to contact them, but they are unresponsive - and the menu has yet to change. So not only have they not fixed the mistake, but they aren't making good on it either. I used to be excited to bring people there, but never again. At least not until they make good on this issue - if they do, I will update this review.
4291;Really disappointed.Came here for a birthday celebration and we were let down before we were even sat down for our meal. My husband booked reservations for approximately 20 people, 3 weeks prior to the actual event date. The week of the event date, we received 3 calls from the restaurant. The first to confirm the amount of people (ok, this is normal), the second, to ask "Are you sure you're going to have 19 people?" After responding, "Yes", they responded with, "Ok, because we get REALLY busy at the time, do you know how long your party will take?"... At this point, they are sounding like they can't accommodate us and putting a time limit on us almost. The third time they called, they asked AGAIN if we were SURE we were going to have 19 people. So at this point, we're feeling pretty unwelcome, but considering we only had a couple of days left before the event - we didn't bother to rebook as it would be difficult to get a reservation for 15+ elsewhere. We arrived the day of, most of our party was on tim
4292;This was an awful dining experience. I happened to look at the clock when we came in, which is good because when my wife asked if this was a ridiculously long wait it just seemed that way because she was hungry I could actually answer. It took 10 minutes for my coffee to come out. Ten minutes later their smoothie arrived. It took another 20 for our food to be served - and it was wrong.  My wife has a wheat allergy and asked if she could order the insides of the monster crepe. They said no problem. About 15 minutes after we ordered the cook double checked that eggs were ok my wife said yes she did want the eggs and the cook asked how she'd like them. So it was a bit surprising when the plate came out with no eggs!?! ...but not that surprising since a friend of the cook came in right after she'd asked about the eggs and they spoke across the counter while she was prepping the food. He, of course, was in and out - arrived about 10 minutes after we did and took his food to go about 10 minutes later. We sat h
4293;Like fresh bugs with your crepes?!  Then this place is for you!My husband and I have walked by this place all the time and decided to go today.The cashier/server was very helpful in the beginning.  She recommended that I get the Paris (nutella and banana) and the Thai (condensed milk and banana) for my husband.We got our crepes and returned to our table.  I took a bite -- delicious!  And then I saw a live, crawling bug on my plate.  Not sure if it came from under the crepe or was just on the plate.  I took it up to the cashier/server and explained there was a live bug on the plate and that I can't eat it.  She seem nonplussed.  I appreciate that bugs can be found in many establishments, but I don't want them on  my plate.  I also expect a refund or at least some concern or appreciation for the situation.  There was none.  Instead she acted as if she didn't understand what I was saying.
4294;Went with a friend.  He only wanted something to drink.  All of the sodas in the cooler were warm, I wanted food, they feature shepherd's pie and some Italian soup. They did not have either one.  I had the hot chix crepe.  It had broccoli but they used the stems and they were raw and tough.  It  took them 20 minutes to make it and it wasn't busy.  What a shame, a great location and lousy food and staff who doesn't  have a clue.
4295;Had heard great things but was very disappointed. The manchego was luke warm and awful. The Iberico Bellota was thickly cut and meh. The olives weren't warm and clearly store bought. The Octopus Raval was cold and flavorless. I've been to Spain numerous times and this barely qualifies as Spanish fare. Not worth the hype.
4296;The room is great. So is the product: drinks and food. The service though, save for one bartender on one night and one barista who I know and so I am biased because I know them, is embarrassingly bad. The host didn't know anything about the menu, I only asked a few basic questions. Every time I go in there, no one is ever smiling. They don't offer water, you have to ask. And as Tom Waits said, you couldn't find a server with a Geiger counter. I had 3 slow, inattentive, and altogether absent service experiences in a row. I wrote in twice. Got no response. They're raking in the dough so who cares, right? This beginning to be endemic in Toronto. I'd rather go next door to Woodlot and be treated like a person who is paying money for great food, drinks, AND great service.
4297;We had been looking forward to going out to Bar Raval and were completely disappointed by the entire experience.They had us sit in the heated patio section - but the heaters weren't working so we were freezing the entire time and they had their door wide open. It was raining and cold last night and the whole atmosphere was terrible as a result.I was hoping the food would make up for the misery of the restaurant - but it was completely disappointing.We ordered many items (chorizo, cheese, kitchen bread, blood sausage, octopus, croquettes, beef tenderloin) and the only thing that stood out was the salt.  The dishes were either completely forgettable or over powered with salt.  There wasn't a single item that I thought I'd want to go back for. In fact, I have a reservation at Bar Isabel in two weeks and am going to cancel it since I've heard the two restaurants are similar. I have no desire to eat their food again.If you're looking for a really good meal, this definitely is not the place. If you're looki
4298;Went there last night to meet a few friends whom were seated on the patio. I got there an explained to the glorified security guard that I was there to see a few friends and they were seated 6 feet away from where I was standing. Later told there was an 8 person limit on the patio. Nice place great atmosphere but annoying to go all the way there and find out there is a limit as to how many people can be seated on the patio when there was room for at least 6 more people there comfortably.
4299;The food was not great, and the service was horrible. There are many other choices for tapas in Toronto... Don't bother with this place.
4300;Just walked in with my husband for dinner and unfortunately we were not able to get a seat. The reason for that is because they barely have any stools. If you are looking to sit down with friends to have nice tapas and drinks this is definately not the place, unless you want to stand around a barrel the whole time.
4301;Bartender ignored us till we ordered drinks from one of the women picking up plates. She was great. He was rude. Also pigs head? It's pork mate. It's shaved pork.
4302;When I heard the idea of visiting a Mediterranean tapas place I engaged the adventure with a yeahh!! I really liked the concept of picking 10 different tapas for 36 something bucks and share.When we arrived to the entrance, I didn't have a good feeling but they were smart enough to display newspaper notes of approval (from 2009) in the windows, so we went in.We ordered hummus, eggplant, potato kind of empanadas, Phylos dough stuffed with spinach, shrimp, shoulder veal and lamb kebabs, salmon, some kind of red sauce we couldn't say what it was, and something else that if I can't even remember for sure wasn't worth at all.The service lacked at lot. She didn't gave us a glass of water even when we ordered beer and wine... When the dishes came, a guy and the waitress would just smack the dishes in the glass table without explaining what was what.But what killed every aspiration of a decent meal was the sound of the pip pip on a microwave... Like seriously they cooked it last night (hopefully) and warmed i
4303;I had THE worst meal of my entire adult life at this restaurant. I am baffled that there are any positive reviews.  My boyfriend and i ordered several dishes on Sunday to take home.  None of them were edible, and I am pretty sure they were old and had been reheated in the microwave. The vine leaves were dry and tasted rotten. The lamb was dry and tasteless. The pita was stale!!!  The kofta came in a sauce that tasted like jarred tomato sauce. The babaganouj was the only dish that was not spoilt. We couldn't eat any of it, and I cannot believe this place is in business.
4304;I heard good things about this restaurant and gave it a try.They call themselves a middle eastern restaurant. I cook and bake many middle eastern foods. I even have traveled to many middle eastern countries and the food at Mezzetta was worse than terrible.They seem to forget that cumin, garlic, salt, pepper, and other spices are used for middle eastern cooking. The flash green beans, which I thought was a Chinese dish was horrible. This is favorite food of our waitress.The falafel was sticky and raw, the baba ganoush flavorless, the pita bread was served cold, the hummus was too thick and flavorless, the hot sauce was disgusting,  mistake, the stuffed phyllo with a sauce of some sort was not pyllo dough and tasteless, the Mediterranean salad was bland. Although the water was very good.  The lone waitress was condescending and not very helpful.There are a lot of  middle eastern restaurants in the GTA and by far this is a disaster. If anyone out there knows middle eastern food stay away and if you don
4305;Terrible. My partner and I walked out. Some dishes were mediocre at best and the rest were all a disappointment.  The bread to start was stale and presentation  awful. We should have called it quits at this point but decided to persevere and frankly we wish we hadn't.
4306;Customer service is awful. Called to place an order and was asked to wait 2 mins which led to the person hanging up. Called right after and they didn't answer. Called for a 3rd time only to be asked to hold again for 5 mins. After 10 mins, they ask to call back in 3 hours instead of just taking the order and asked me to take the business elsewhere...Food may be good but attitude needs some checking. Will not be going there.
4307;I have never been treated so rudely as by the staff in this place. food was good and cheap but it's not worth the attitude that comes with it.
4308;The manager here is very rude.. I bought 4 box of lamb briyani Yesterday. And three of the family mamber was sick the next day. When I call them today just to tell them to be careful next time. Inserted of telling me sorry the manager start talking rude. I am a chef too and I don't want free stuff. Will never go back again. Or introduced it to anyone
4309;my husband and I just came from this restaurant.  After sitting there for an hour and a half we decided to ask the waiter what the status of our meal was.  He did not know.  He told us that people were arriving later than their reservations.  People who arrived after us were served before us.  We decided to leave.  This restaurant does not have control of their kitchen.  We ate at McDonalds.  Maybe this restaurant should take  some note of McDonalds who seems to be able to serve their customers in a timely fashion!!!
4310;One of the worst eating experiences I've ever had. The cow must have been 50 when it was made into streak. Just awful.
4311;Date 29th April Time of Visit: 11:45pm Really bad and foul tasting cheese dip provided with chips (I have this regularly so I know its taste very well). They refused to refund me and when I asked to speak to store manager she refused to speak to me (when she was clearly visible to me but she decided to not to speak to me).We regularly go to this location to dine. But today I went to this location with some of my friends, the restaurant was very dirty from inside. The floor was full of food dearie and there were also some used hand gloves near the make table. Saw one of the staff members cleaning one of the equipments with sanitizer cloth but I noticed 3 times she went back to the make table to serve customer and she was touching food surface and food containers as well as salsa scoop without washing her hands. I work at restaurant so I noticed this issue right away. I also saw other employees doing similar things. Even the taste of food was not similar to other locations. I don't think I will be goin
4312;Very very poor service. Restaurant is too dark inside. They do not believe in lighting or at least they don't want to bring attention to the dirty dated dining area. We waited 20 mins before the lousy waitress even took our order. At which point she made us feel like we were bothering her. We even saw another patron go behind the bar and serve herself. There were only 3 other tables of customers. We waited nearly an hour for our food that was awful. The shiro was watery and the doro wat was burnt. Being East African we are very familiar with the food and know what to expect. They took advantage of my young family thinking we didn't know better. To top it all of the waitress was rude, inattentive and quite frankly really miserable.NEVER GOING BACK!
4313;Food was ok.Service was horrible. People working there were friendly but that is no excuse for horrid service. Even the bill took over 20 minutes. Just couldn't wait to get out of there and even that took long.
4314;I decided to try this place after a colleague of mine recommended it.The restaurant was fairly empty at 7:00pm, with an excess amount of serving staff.My party of 4 decided to order the special meat balls dish, with hot and sour soup, minced pork green beans, fried and boiled dumplings, along with white rice.Let's start with the food first: soup was insanely spicy, too spicy even for a hot and sour soup. The meatballs were not firm, filled with more rice, and an odd taste (don't recommend ordering it at $16.99 for a tiny dish). The only decent items were the dumplings which were at least flavourful. Our bill came to $75 for everything - which was a rip off!On to the service, at first things were fine, water was provided, order was taken in a timely manner. Things started getting pretty frustrating when we found ourselves asking 3-4 times for soya sauce, then the bowls of rice we ordered. Maybe 2-3 servers passed us by without acknowledging we needed something. The worse part was their attitudes, didn'
4315;Bad attitude , Bad service, the food tastes not good too!! Won't come back for sure !!!!
4316;Bad Serivce. The manager is sort of rude and the servers don't even give you spoons when serving soups unless you spend 5 minutes waiting for a server to have time to give you one. 10 out of 10 would not recommend.
4317;This place is disgusting. Rude and inattentive servers. Soup wasnt bad but the mushroom and broccoli was swimming in cheap oil. Had to leave most of it.I then got told off by my server for wanting to pay by debit.
4318;They charge you tips after tax. Talked to the waiter and he blamed the owner for telling them to do so. He even brought a calculator to our table and did the math to tell us how much we should pay lol. Also funny that they said very specially 12% tips is minimum, and they charge you tips (after tax) because many customers do not pay tips, so they need to make sure their waiters get paid tips.Food was alright. Too greasy and spicy to my taste. The decor and atmosphere is not bad, but they really need to work on their service.
4319;Food was overcooked. For most of the dishes we ordered. Staff did not like us complaining about the way it was cooked. Reluctant to provide us another meal instead of the overcooked and strange food.
4320;Based on some good reviews  from Yelp ,I decided to go try the restaurant yesterday.IT was a totally  big disappointment.The server was extremely unpleasant with a Don't  Care Less attitude, the worst I have ever experienced: no basic manner at all.Lychee Shrimp - nothing special.Marinated beef, spicy version- adequate.I was very shocked that this restaurant has all the 5 Star rating!I wonder how genuine the reviews are!!!!!
4321;They added a sign on their window that said "FREE SOUP (for residents of the condo next door)". I went in and inquired about this 'free soup' and the lady told me I had to buy something first. That felt a little deceitful since there was no mention of any purchase necessary. I then asked what their best dish was and she said "everything". Not a very good response when you're trying to figure out specifically what to get. I ended up getting the burger for $5.99 (no fries or drink included). It tasted like your typical store bought frozen burger patty. There are TONS of other restaurants around the area. Do not waste your money on average food and average service.
4322;Would not recommend based on the hygienic practices of the person working there and their attitude. Handling cash, then making pizza, gross
4323;Just awful. The sashimi was NOT fresh, it was slimey and smelled bad. I ended up throwing it out. The prices are not cheap enough to warrant this quality. The place will also try to cheat you by giving you the least expensive ingredients. When you order the 20 pc sashimi on JUSTEAT, it asks you to pick one fish (which is strange). If you choose salmon, then you get all salmon because salmon is the cheapest fish. If you pick eel, then they will give you an assortment of sashimi. It does not make me feel good that they think they can deny me a proper assortment when I picked salmon, but at the same time, they are unwilling to give me all eel when I picked eel. They also forgot to include the soup, and when confronted, their attitude is just atrocious. I strongly advise AGAINST this place.
4324;I was pretty disappointed with this restaurant.  I've been to the main playa cabana on dupont and I expected much more.  They brought me cold chicken tingas which i even asked the waitress who said that was normal.  The mojito was bleh and the tostadas  were cold and didnt seem homemade like the location on dupont. And finally the beef they served was dry and poor quality
4325;My dinner upset my stomach. This is thanks to the almost cold dinner I had at Cocina Economica. Despite other reviews I read, my experience tonight was very disappointing. Highlights:- poor portions that contained 50% fat and bone in the meal- small drink for a high price - long wait time for our dinner which arrived in stages and was not hot- a policy not to do separate bills- an automatic addition of 18% for a group- bland disappointing dishes- Surprises on the bill (nickel and diming over what comes with your meal and what is extra)The Margarita on various pages I previously saw was in a margarita glass and looked great. What I actually got was small and disappointing. Not even in a proper glass. $12 for a tiny  drink. I asked the waiter for a proper glass and to his credit, he corrected it but it is disappointing it was necessary to do so. The portion was pretty small compared to other Margaritas I have had.The beans and rice were not served on our main plate as pictured in other reviews. They 
4326;So I was here by myself. While everyone around me got complimentary chips and guacamole I got none. The food was so small in portion and tasted awful. Def won't come back.
4327;Over priced and below average portions. The chorizo was the cheapest I have ever had. The service was ok. The wine selection was slim. And 12$ beer was soso. I do not understand the positive reviews. We were a group of 10 and we all felt disappointed.
4328;I was thoroughly disappointed with the experience. As someone who has worked in the hospitality industry I'm pretty laid back when it comes to bad service as I completely understand how tough it is to work in a restaurant. This review is more about the hostess and the manager. We arrived early for a reservation as we heard this place gets quite busy and weren't sitter until an hour after our reservation time. Yup you heard me, 1 hour. We sat at the bar to have a drink as suggested by the hostess and noticed people were being seated before us who came after us. We decided to ask and the hostess said there reservation was before us and stated the same time as ours. We reminded her ours was the same time and came before them hence us our drinks were almost done. Then she said "oh really, your reservation was before theirs?" Very sarcastically as we were lying. Then said I will go check and did not come back for a long time. At this point it was 45 minutes after our reservation time. When she finally came back we
4329;I went for a birthday dinner with a large group of 15+ people.  We were required to have a set priced menu, for which we chose the most expensive of three options presented to us.  The food was pretty much all disgusting. No flavour, volumous piles of crap.
4330;This place sucks Last night was my third time there and another big regret . It was a bday party dinner otherwise I wouldn't waste my time and money !!!!Food was awful again . Place was super hot to the point we couldn't eat out dinner . Asked 4 times for a desert which we already paid and they ever bring it to us !!!! How f.ed up is that And obviously a huge none sense bill. Such a big ripoff
4331;The atmosphere is cramped and loud but the interior decor is tasteful. To access the bathroom you need to go up a large, open staircase within the line of sight of all the patrons in the centre prosterior of the venus. If you're shy, you may feel unforgettable.The service was wanting. For instance, I really would wish the manager had let me explain why I sent back a dish. It was a complete disaster. I wanted to let her know why it wasn't minimally acceptable. I felt like I was cut off. I also wish the waiter had not merely asked my food limitations as a formality but had actually caught that we ordered a dish with a non-menu-disclosed cream sauce base. I didn't sent that one back but I wish I had.The food was the true disappointment.A special of the day was chopped lobster on several small potato disks. The lobster was slightly warm on only at certain points but refrigerator cold in the middle, the potato disks were undercooked and again cold in the centre cooked, and the dish was bland. My companion an
4332;The food is mediocre and overpriced, but the real standout of my experience here was how pretentious and arrogant Patria representatives are. I was treated with unabashed condescension in a pretentious and loud setting, where it was made extremely clear that you are viewed as a dollar amount, and not as a customer or guest worthy of basic courtesy or respect. Even if the food had been worth the price, which it certainly was not, I would never willingly return to such an utterly uncomfortable and arrogant atmosphere.
4333;Very disappointed with the experience I had here yesterday. Ordered the large size pallela as soon as we sat down knowing they take a while (45 minutes) to cook. Had 2 appetizers in the meanwhile which were delicious but way over priced for the quantity. The pallela was later dropped off but we had received the small one which was not enough for sharing. We wanted to tell someone so that maybe they could get another one started but no one came by or acknowledged us until long after we finished the small pallela. We told the guy clearing our plates to grab our server but he didn't come by for another 10/15 minutes and by the time he came by it was just too late to wait by then. Server was very knowledgeable and I could tell he cared but probably just too busy which is not his fault since this is probably an issue with being understaffed. I understand simple errors like this happen but it was the way in which the situation was handled that made me so disappointed. We were eventually given the option of free des
4334;The service was horrible and the food is definitely over rated. We came here based on Yelp ratings and it was a total disappointment. The sangria they served was watered down tasting almost like a cough syrup. Squid was over cooked, when the waitress came to ask us how the squid was, we told her it was really dry and all she said was:"oh, I'm sorry to hear that."(do something about it!) Paella wasn't tasty at all, taste as if they just boiled it in tomato sauce. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. If you want good paella, go to Carman on Queen street.
4335;Came here on a date night because my boyfriend and I were craving paella and were excited to try it. We'd read many bad reviews, but were willing to give it a chance because there are so few places to get paella in the city and were just in the mood for Spanish food. After the service we experienced and the food that we got, we would never come back.The Good: The atmosphere was lovely. Perfect set-up for a date spot with wonderful lighting and a romantic ambiance. Totally ready to dig in and ordered several different dishes (the bacon-wrapped dates, assorted meats, the paella, etc.) Until....The Bad: Yes, I get that they're tapas. Yes, I know that they're small. But there's a difference between little appetizers that leave one's stomach feeling intrigued, excited, satisfied (which many of the other Spanish tapas restaurants we've been to, like Bar Isabel were able to get) and servings that are just plain stingy. Think: a sliver of cheese with one piece of bread on the side, three puny wrapped dates in one
4336;I have been to Patria several times. The decor is beautiful, the food is decent and the service is usually good. Last night, however, I went with a friend of mine. Just the two of us, we wanted to order a half litre of wine. We were debating between a couple of $28ish options and asked for the server's opinion. He said "get the ____ it is absolutely the best choice, you will love it." so we said ok. I should have checked if it was one of the options that we were looking at. The bill came and it was close to SEVENTY DOLLARS for a half litre, that was not a generous pour either. We had a glass and a 1/3 each. My dining partner is on maternity leave, so I picked up the bill. I hate this shady, sneaky behaviour. I won't be back.
4337;The atmosphere ia great, amazing layout and great ambience. However,I ordered a drink and when I was just about finished I saw a rather large insect in my drink. When I notified the waitress not only was she not concerned she didn't do anything to help me. She continued to explain to me that it must have fallen into my drink from one of their fixtures. She tried to bring me another one but we were ready to leave and pay the bill. Regardless it was disgusting. This is a great indication of their client service, which is horrible.I wouldn't recommend to a friend and I most likely won't return. Which is such a shame because it is a lovely lovely place.
4338;This felt like just hype. The place looks good, hip music and an upscale crowd. However, food is below par. I've dined at a few Spanish restaurants around the globe, suffice to say I had the worst paella at Patria. Drinks are watered down and very expensive. We paid $200 for a dinner for two.Would not return or recommend to anyone looking for good food
4339;I went with a girlfriend for brunch on a Sunday where they have "bottomless" mimosas. We ordered FOUR dishes and when we were finished, the waitress told us we HAD to order more food to get another mimosa.  Obviously they don't know what bottomless means. I will make sure to tell everyone I know about my experience and also post this on all social platforms.
4340;One of my pet peeves is to pay high prices at a restaurant, and still leave hungry.  It's even more aggravating when the food is just ordinary.  This was my experience at Patria.We were told by the server we should order 3-4 items per person so long as it included some items from the heavier dishes.  We ordered 4 items per person from across the menu, just as instructed, and there was still very little food to be had.The choritzo ($7) was sliced very thinly and there was just enough to cover a small saucer.  In other words, there was very little of it.  The Jamon Serrano ($13) was just enough to cover a medium sized dish.  In other words, there was very little of it too.We ordered two types of goat cheese (Roncal and Garrotxas).  They were both firm cheeses, and I must say rather underwhelming.  There was a little piece of each, hardly justified for $9 a piece.The "Patatas Bravas Con Huevo Frito" (Crispy Potato + Spicy Tomato + Fried Egg) was very disappointing at $10.  It looked and tasted like home 
4341;Way over priced for the quality and quantity of food that you get here. My GF had been wanting to go here for a while now so I decided to take her this year for her birthday. We ended up spending over $400 for 5 people (without alcohol) and here's the kicker, we brought in our own cake for her birthday and guess what, they charge you $5 a person for plating fees! RIDICULOUS! After spending that much money and they still need to charge me more for my own cake. I thought that they would at least would decorate each plate with some syrup or fruit or something but nope. All they did was slice it and put it on a plate. hahaha. What a joke! Here's my list of Good and bad: Good: - nice ambience- great serviceBad:- really pricey- really small portions- taste of food is nothing special- charge to plate cakeI wouldn't recommend it to anyone I care about.
4342;Not a fan!Came here late sat night to grab a bite and catch up with a friend.  Attempted to make reservations beforehand, but they told us it was sold out and to just pop by and there might be room at the bar.  So... we arrived around 10:30pm, there was an opening for a table for 2 around the bar area, and the hostess and staff quickly cleared the table for us.Then our server told us that they no longer serve the paella, as the kitchen closes at 11, and the paella needs 45 mins to cook... I was very disappointed since that's the main reason we came here.  We then proceeded to order a few tapas, but the server did not seem impress, and asked us whether we're eating light.  He then suggested 2 more tapas, which we ordered promptly as we were hungry!  The server asked us if we were going to order a drink, I asked him for a red wine suggestion... and he suggested the most expensive red by the glass (which was horrible and gave me a headache almost immediately)  but didn't take my friend's drink order.  My fri
4343;Made reservations a few months ago for Valentine's Day on Open Table, but the restaurant cancelled our reservations today, at 4am on Valentine's Day through email.Called the restaurant to inquire why, and they said they tried to call 3 times over the last 2 weeks for a credit card number.  However, I never had a received or missed call from an unknown number over that time period.  Also confirmed that they had the right phone number.Now they have no tables available and I'm left out in the cold.  He said, she said thing so take it for what it's worth, but I'm pretty annoyed and definitely not impressed.
4344;Definitely AVOID this place if you're looking for a superior dining experience. The staff at Patria treated my friend and I with disrespect, speaking in a condescending and patronizing manner. It should not be abnormal to go for dessert and drinks on a Monday night. The food and drinks are also totally over-priced. It is very obvious that they only value you as patrons if you're willing to throw down exorbitant amounts of cash. Toronto is full of amazing restaurants with high quality food AND service. It is not enough to just have reasonable food.
4345;don't waste your money!! this place is terrible .. I paid $8 for a small ham pita ..they don't even load it up with veggies. I asked for romaine..and it was like the girl literally counted out 3 pieces.. seriously? lettuce doesn't cost anything!! I asked for mushrooms..got 5 half pieces.. super cheap on toppings. I could have went to subway and got more food for the price I paid. I've been to many other pita pits and they LOAD your pita up with meat and whatever toppings you want.. this place is a jokeWish I could rate lower than 1 star
4346;This review has nothing to do with the food. But probably more to do with treatment and service. It is crystal clear when you order kebob with salad. Like burger with fries. Like fish and chips etc that you are NOT ordering 2 separate dishes. There are different types of order taking. In this place not only that they didn't verify my order but purposely misunderstood me. I mean by purposely means that somehow, regardless of what I said and how many times I tried to clarify and explain myself, no matter how hard I tried! they simply never accepted that I DO NOT WANT TWO SEPARATE dishes.What this means is that although it was crystal clear for them what I was meaning, someway somehow they were hell bent on not understanding me! and do so with a smile. IO the kebab won't come with bread! And that's the justification for them to misunderstand me ( with a smile). the kebab comes with either bread or rice! WHAT! the kebob DOES come with either rice OR Salad! and if I want to order bread usually bread 
4347;I attend as a first time with my family (5 together). We all ordered Different Kabab like Kabab torsh, chenjeh, barg, koobideh and baghalipolo but we all agreed although the foods were clean and nice served, the quality were not good. On top of that, the cashier was not nice at all while I was paying my bill. She was RUDDDDDDD .dump itWont go anymore!
4348;The owner of this place is a total thief and tried to cheat us by double charging us. Here is the story:I took my family to this restaurant on July 16th for lunch. We ordered the food and it was okay, nothing great though. Service was below average and the place is too small. The bill came out around $132. I put my American Express credit card and the waiter took it and swiped it and came back saying that they don't accept Amex cards. I said fine, please give me the decliner receipt for my credit card since you've already swiped it and I'll pay cash. Before giving me the receipt, I already gave her the cash and was waiting for her to hand me over the declined receipt for my Amex card. However, the receipt she gave me was an "approved" receipt! I was shocked and told her that this is an approved transaction and you have already charged me the full amount on my credit card so please return the cash. She answered that she needs to confirm with the owner who was sitting at a table next to the cash register. He 
4349;Run for your life!! stay far away from this so called restaurant! As a Persian food admirer I have never had such terrible meal. I came there with my boyfriend for a fun night and we both had agonizing stomachache for a whole day after eating their food!! We ordered Mirzaghasemi  and Vaziri (chicken bbq and koobideh) which are of my favourite Persian foods. The Mirzaghasemi tasted like dog puke mixed with garlic. absolutely disgusting taste. funny enough the table next to us were complaining about their food as well. After waiting for half an hour we got the bbq and first thing we noticed was a hair sticking to our bbq. beyond gross but we didn't want to ruin our night so we just picked it out and tried to forget it ever happened. The bbq was completely uncooked inside but the outside was burnt burnt!! we asked them to cook it some more as the Koobideh was super rare!! after the bbq it some we tried it. this was literally the single most disgusting taste koobideh I ever had in my life. I could still feel the 
4350;1st time here and never again if you are not Persian then they will treat you like SHIT and sad part is food was good as long you can stand being treated like 2nd class citizen also got over charged for food did not received and mistake made by the waiter of taking order who refuse to admit it was his mistake but we paid for it. also he never checked on us to see if we liked the food. we where seated by the table beside the washroom who has table that close to a washroom door that doesn't close itself and my friends had to get up to close it middle of eating WTF four people $90 money I rather gave if homeless
4351;The restaurant looks presentable. When we got our thali(s) that's when everything went downwards. The rice was old and powdery. Don't know if they pull it out the freezer. Nowhere near fresh. The portions for the combos(thali) was so tiny that even my 9year old son can eat. That's 10$ for thali. And we order more curry chicken and that was small too and watered down. The dessert was ras malai and it was straight out the freezer and into the microwave therefore gave it that discussing rubbery chew. All the food is basically frozen and then Thawed before it reaches your table. We order the lassi and that was a waste of time. It was just watered down with water and then blended vigorously so it gave it that soapy foam sud look. Eew. I would find another place to dine. Stay clear.
4352;I remember coming here last year because someone recommended me this place. Food was okay. Service was terrible. And when I paid for my food, the total came to $9. I put down a $10 and waited several minutes and I didn't get my change. Have to go up to the counter and request for my change. The server said "this doesn't include the tip." So left the $1 on the counter and walked out feeling disgusted. It is a real turn off for me anytime someone demands for a tip and not even giving me back my change and I have to go up to the counter to request for it. I don't like place that demands for a tip.
4353;The worst korean restaurant I been in my life and the services and there pork bone soup is freaking suck and I would never go back there again. The owner is freaking racist too.
4354;Not really sure why this place has such high reviews. My friend and I ordered the hot pot which was basically meat and vegetables in a sugar soup. So gross!We also had a side of potato pancakes which tasted like really oily hash browns. That tasted good but it's really hard to mess up fried potatoes. At least they managed to withhold putting sugar in this dish!
4355;Was a regular customer here and I never asked for refills just because they always give generous portions. One day I asked for refills because two of the side dishes tasted good but I wasn't able to finish all the side dishes and had some leftovers from the main dish. I really didn't want to waste the food so I asked for a to go box but the waitress was very hostile and rude and assumed that I asked for the refills so that I could take them home. I was shocked and disappointed because I actually do like the food here but will not go back again. Shame.
4356;This is a take out service review- I absolutely love dine in.Extremely disappointed with the level of service and detail to their take out. We ordered our regular seafood pancake, dukk bokki, spicy sirloin and rice. I requested the ramen noodles in the dukk bokki be replaced with glass noodles as they have always done for me during done-in without a problem. After placing my order, I confirmed with the gentleman that I was ordering 3 items. Upon receiving my order (someone picked up for us), the seafood pancake was a complete soggy, soy-saturated disaster. Somehow the plastic sauce container melted and all the soy sauce, and I mean the ENTIRE thing leaked into the container and was absorbed by the pancake. Please see photos. The plastic was melted to a smooth finish, the grids on the container aren't even visible anymore! A waste of $9!  We couldn't eat the pancake, it was too salty.The dukk bokki- my most anticipated dish(I was famished)!  It was with ramen!! I hate ramen because it absorbs all the sau
4357;I'm so upset with the server here. It was 11:30am and I brought my Starbucks. I realize it can be rude to drink coffee but I wanted to finish it. The server with an English/Australian accent was super rude. Avoid the server.
4358;Quality has gone way, way down in the past couple months. The service: first they got the reservation wrong and sat us, three people, way in the back on a 6-person table where we had a wonderful view of the back end of the kitchen. The waitress took 20 minutes just to get our drink order. And then the appetiser came, the 3-dip chips, and THEN came our drink. The chicken tacos, once delicious, are now just awful. The meat tastes like and has the consistency of canned flaked chicken. Everything was over-spiced, the shrimp tacos smothered by hot sauce. A real pity.
4359;I am giving one star just because of the pleasant atmosphere at this place. The customer service was less than acceptable. I work in Liberty Village and I heard very good reviews about the food Merci Mon Ami offers which was the reason why I went there during my lunch break.After making it clear with the cashier that it takes about 10 minutes to receive our food, we sat down waiting to dine in. While waiting we realized that 5 people who ordered food after us received it before us.  After 15 minutes waiting, we asked if the food was coming out and we were assured that it was. After that I saw that she was taking out our sandwiches from the fridge that were going to be warmed up.  Who wants to pay nearly 12 bucks for a sandwich from the fridge and wait 20 minutes for them? - At least, not me!After 20 minutes waiting for my lunch and a misunderstanding, I was returned my money and left. They never apologized for the wait and for the ruined lunch. I would not recommend this place, although they food may be g
4360;Hi!! I'm a vegetarian that eats animal broth, apparently a difficult concept to understand for the team at Kinton. I wanted some spicy ramen with tofu-not a hard problem right? The waitress, manager on duty, then chef were completely unaccommodating. Although it would have been able to get any other protein for the same price, $10.90, they wouldn't allow any "substitutions" to the ramen (no tofu) but suggested I could give my meat to one of my friends and wanted to sell me on the tofu appetizer that I could add to my ramen instead (which was also almost $6 extra!). Ended up with an boring flavored vegetarian ramen that I jazzed up with the addition of the kimchee appetizer. Also repeatedly had to ask for things before getting them-soy sauce, Diet Coke that was ordered, etc. And not a fan of the yelling whenever someone enters/exits the restaurant. Will not be returning.
4361;This review is based solely on my experience for takeout. The Taste was good as expected but the portions were ridiculously small I ordered two chicken ramen one was spicy and one regular the spicy one arrived with three thin slices of chicken  weighing less than 100 grams the the one with the regular sauce arrived with two slices of chicken that if you wrap them up they would be the tip of the Q-tip and one boiled egg. The total for the order was $29 and in both plates there was less than half chicken breast Noodles & Water. So for the taste and the quantity and the quality this was an insult to my intelligence. I think they have a great location and very good potential if they straighten the price / portion ratio
4362;Had a fly in my bowl of ramen, called the waitress over, and she offered me a new bowl which was nice. But she then went on telling me how it's 'fly season' and that it's normal that the lamps (directly above the heads of seated customers) attract flies and that sometimes they will fall into the bowl and that we customers, should be careful about this. She even suggested me to move my chair to the side and eat at the corner of the table. I was bewildered by her treatment, however I just acknowledged her excuses and went on eating my 'new' bowl of ramen, which was most likely the exact same bowl.
4363;I hate to kill the 5-star vibe of this place but the food is awful. I am rating the food not the atmosphere or the character of the owner. The falafel is made from a powdered mix you add water to. Don't argue with me I really know what I'm talking about. The chili isn't chili. It's tomato sauce from a can with the odd bean (maybe) and one piece of meat in the bowl. No chili flavour at all.The lentil and rice is just dried mush with no flavour.Nothing is spiced (not even the spicy potatoes!).It was just plain awful. If you're used to processed food then you'll like it. But if you know your way around a kitchen then it's best to feel the love from a distance because you won't get it from the food.Incidentally, my lunchmate found the constant chatter of the owner irritating. I didn't find it irritating but I didn't find it amusing either. The vibe does seem authentic though so if you're into it, you're into it. Neither the food nor the chatter is inviting to me.P.S I'm guessing the famous banana an
4364;I read a few good reviews and decided to stop by to try the food. Arrived at 7:15pm to find store hours posted at the door stating the restaurant was open until 8:00pm (also checked in advance on Yelp) and the door locked. I saw a woman behind the counter so went back to my car to get out of the POURING rain, gave them a call, and was told -- completely unapologetically -- that they were closed for the day. It's not acceptable to ditch early just because you're not feelin' it. Respect your own business hours, your customers, and the integrity of the information you distribute.Update:  Gave it a second try.  Not able to increase the rating.  I really don't understand the positive comments.  Sauce tastes mainly like the green peppers that are used to colour it.  Chicken is flavoured from roasting but lacks any form of seasoning.  Beans seem like they're straight out of the can, unrinsed/undrained and entirely unseasoned.
4365;After such a long time..i brought my family back here to eat goto (rice porridge) and tokwa't baboy and lastly, the famous tapsilog filipino breakfast.  the goto and tokwa't baboy was good but the tapsilog we found a strand of hair mixed in the garlic rice, we told the server and apologize and replaced it with a new one.Brought the tapsilog home for my family to eat at home only to have found another strand of hair in the garlic rice. I'm so disappointed at the quality of the food. I will not return and will not recommend for anyone to go to this place since the quality of the food has gone down below zero.
4366;Atmosphere: Nice, clean place in Yorkville serving health foods and juices.Service: The guy at the counter seemed pretty nonchalant and didn't really acknowledge us anymore soon after we paid for our product, even though we ate inside the store.Product Review: My boyfriend and I specifically went there for the Acai bowl since we were on a quest to look for one that is comparable to the ones we've had in Brazil.  I've got to say that this one was the worst one I've tried in Toronto.  The smoothie base came out tasting like a frozen raspberry sorbet with no hint of acai what-so-ever.  Because of the frozen smoothie base, the granola and dried fruit that were on top of the smoothie became hard and difficult to chew. It was definitely not worth the amount of money spent!Recommendation:  The store looks like it may have some other great products if you're into healthy options or pressed juice.  Just save your $12.00 to buy something else instead of the acai bowl.
4367;Can't believe this place got 4 stars on yelp, definitely overrated. I went there for lunch today and ordered the lemongrass beef ribs lunch special advertised on the restaurant's pop-up poster board. I thought it would be a safe choice given this is a featured dish on their advertising.Boy, was I wrong!When the dish came, there were only a few extremely thin slice of very small ribs lying on the big plate, most of them fatty. Vegetables are non existent other than two small slice of  cucumber. I guess the big mount of rice was supposed to be my main dish. So 11 dollars later, I walked out of there still hungry as hell and extremely unsatisfied. Never going back there again!
4368;I tried this place based on the good reviews on yelp but was utterly disappointed. The name is a compete misnomer, there's no real pho and they definitely don't use angus beef. It seems like they are famous for their Malaysian curry and "thai" style pho.The owners or even chef is possibly chinese and I can't figure out what they are trying to be a Vietnamese restaurant or a Malaysian restaurant because they don't do either well.  Pho Spring Garden is another pho place that I don't mind despite not being authentic. I don't know if I would ever go back here though for the pho.  The meat was not the quality or variety you normally expect in a pho restaurant. The service was quick but be careful the floor is slippery and I can see an accident just waiting to happen with all them hot soups flying out the kitchen.
4369;My friend and I were looking for halal Pho in the GTA so, we searched on Yelp and Angus Pho was listed as number 1. We called the listed number and they said their meat isn't halal. Why is this listed under halal then?
4370;Angus Pho House unfortunately doesn't live up to its Yelp rating. They forgot our appetisers and messed up one of the main courses, forgetting to exclude chicken from the pad thai even after they had been told that one of my friends only eats halal. They quickly rectified their mistake, but I can't be sure if they cooked the pad thai afresh or simply removed the chicken from the original serving.My goat brisket was 99% fat and uninspired. My friend did not like his pho at all.The best part about the restaurant: the Vietnamese murals on the walls.
4371;Pho yes, hoi nan chicken rice pretty good, laksa could be better since it had more soup than ingredients and lastly curry pork chop rice ... no.  I've had better curry in foodcourt better than this place.  There was no balance in the ingredients as it was literally pork chop + curry.  No vegetables.  If i can describe a first at this restaurant, it is a first time tasting sweet curry
4372;I read some good reviews about Angus Pho House and decided to try it out with a friend. Boy was it a disappointment.  They are really cheap on the food they served.  My grilled chicken, spring roll with vermicelli was really just a big bowl of thick noodles with fatty grilled chicken pieces, one small deep fried spring roll and a bunch of bean sprout and tiny amount of lettuce, carrot and cucumber.  It had no taste and the fish sauce that came with the dish tasted like sugar water. Did they forget the fish sauce?  I had better.  The avocado milkshake had a tiny hint of avocado, it tasted more like milk, the avocado colour did not fool me.   Is there a shortage of avocado?   My friend ordered the grilled chicken rice noodle soup and it was very salty.  This is how you cover up the fact that there are no other spices!  Add salt.  So glad we only ordered just a couple of dishes to try. (Suggestion: always try just a couple of dishes when trying out new restaurant, avoid ordering many dishes) This restaurant was 
4373;Let me start off by saying the food is not great. Not horrible, but not great either. Kind of subpar to be honest.What's worse than the food is the attitude and service of this location. Let me explain:I had just received a pho I had ordered (rare beef with tripe). Right as I begin eating I find a fly in the soup. Absolutely filthy, but I understand that it might happen from time to time. I called the lady over and showed her the fly and that they should just take it back. She asked me if I wanted anything else but as I had lost my appetite I declined and watched as my friends finished their food. Then came the bill.She included the price of the pho, which I had not touched, which had a fly chilling in the soup as if it were on a lazy river, on the bill. I obviously thought she had just forgot to void it so I brought it up to her. She then had the audacity to tell me that she could not take it off the bill and that I would have to PAY HER for SERVING ME a FLY soup. When I refused she thought about it 
4374;I had a very lousy and miserable experience this past week when I attempted to have dinner here. I sent the restaurant an email with a complete description and they didn't bother to acknowledge my email.Yet, I am not surprised given how rude the male hostess treated me and how much of a peanut gallery the servers behaved like.  I have never been treated so rudely and been insulted by the hostess before. I am never returning to this place and will continue supporting one of the many other Italian restaurants in the neighbourhood.How appropriate that they are named Old. They treat single patrons with disdain and younger patrons with such rudeness, like an old man looking with contempt to the new generation.I am never again coming to La Vecchia.
4375;I live in the Yonge/ Egg area and always heard this was supposed to be the best place on Yonge for food as the neighbourhood is quite lacking in the food area to begin with. I had high hopes for this restaurant but was gravely disappointed with the service and the food. The flavours they have are all wrong. Most of the food was very pungent and did not have a smooth flow of flavours. It was rather sour the risotto we ordered. We also ordered prawns and the sauces they chose were sour and pungent with too much salt. ( it's all in the sauce for Italian dishes). The Gnocchi was okay, it tasted like the Costco brand in a cream sauce ( who could mess up a cream sauce tbh) anyhow I am very disappointed. I did not find the food appetizing at all. The flavours were all mixed up and not great on the palette. My waiter unfortunately was very short tempered and seemed agitated the whole time whilst serving my family and I. Whenever we did need something he was never available and would rush off before we finished 
4376;Fish lunch special tasted funny and over priced for the portion. Ended up spending more time paying bills than actually eating.
4377;I went here with no pretenses as it was recommended to have the best patio in the area.  The service was appalling however - the worst I I've had in Toronto. Food was fairly good though - shame I wont be returning.
4378;We made reservations at this restaurant on a Friday night and showed up right on time. As we walked in we saw about 7 people uncomfortably standing by the door and around the tables waiting to be seated. We waited for about 10 minutes until the gentleman who I assume to be the manager approached us and sort of looked at us. I quickly let him know that we have reservations for 8:15 under my friend's name and he sort of nodded and walked away. Another 10 minutes had passed and we were still awkwardly standing in the little space between the door and the tables. The gentleman walked by us and we inquired about our table one more time stating that our reservations were for 8:15 and it was already 8:35. To which he said, "look man all these people have reservations, you just have to wait". Afterwards by friend looked at him and said that we made reservations so that we wouldn't have to wait for the table. After waiting for another five minutes we decided to go somehere else as this place clearly didn't want to ser
4379;I'm a firm believer that fine dining is an experience and it's not just about the food. If this was a review just about the food I would give this review a 3 star rating because the food was not bad and just about average. My experience with the staff and particularly a gentleman who claimed to be the owner was quite disappointing. It was a Saturday night and my date and I came in as walk in clients without a reservation. We were told there was a 20 minute wait and we said "no problem," and went for a walk. We came back as prompted just to be told to wait 5 minutes more... 5 minutes go by and then we asked for our table and were told 5 more minutes again... And again.. And again... When I voiced my concerns to the owner he talked to us in a very CONDESCENDING and ARROGANT way telling us such things as "hey we are a busy restaurant lot of people want to eat here and you have to wait." His arrogance is unjustified by the quality of the food. We ended up staying because my date insisted we may as well but then
4380;I came to La Vecchia because of a friend's recommendation, so I had high hopes!  Upon entering the restaurant, I noticed how dark it was and because I have really bad astigmatism, I was seeing dark spots everywhere. The host asked if we had a reservation, and we said no. He looks at his 'chart' and said "Oh, you're lucky we have one last table in the back" - which, by the way, is right in front of the washroom (with a cold draft during the whole meal). I was fine with our seating arrangement, except that there were plenty of empty tables that remained unoccupied till the end of our dinner...Aside from the hostess coming off as pretentious, our server was actually quite pleasant. We ordered Bruschetta La Vecchia ($8.75) to start and it arrived at our table really quick. It was a dish that I probably could have made at home - the tomatoes were really cold and the bread was rock hard. I did not enjoy this appetizer at all. I ordered the Triangoli Toto ($16) as the entree which was Whole wheat triangle sh
4381;The food was not authentic Italian. Feta in salad at an Italian resto?? The chicken pollo I got was way too salty and overpriced (it was a small portion, too). Poor service didn't contribute to a positive experience either. The waiter even had the nerves to tell us too isn't included in our bill.
4382;Terrible experience trying to book a reservation for a large group. They rip you off - charging a set menu of $50 - 1 salad (reg $11)  and 1 pasta ($16) which doesn't even add up to $50 on their a la carte menu! I will never book here. Does the manager think we can't do math?! Absolutely insulted.
4383;Bad service! The server was very rude and abrasive. We had a cup of Starbucks tea with us when we went into the restaurant. I would understand if it was explained politely to us that external drinks are not allowed inside. However, the server poured the tea out without asking or letting us know. Near the end of the meal, the server asked if I would like to top up my coffee, but he never came back to refill it even though I had said yes. Over at the next table, I overheard the server and the customer debating over what was asked to go with the coffee - cream or milk. And of course, the server blamed the customer for making the mistake. Overall, the food was ok, but the restaurant lost points for poor customer service. I recommend that their servers go through customer training if they want to stay in business. We are definitely not going back again. There are other really good Italian restaurants in the area - Grazie is one.
4384;It took 20 minutes for a server to acknowledge us and offer bread and water. Hoping the food was worth the wait, we placed an order for appetisers. It wasn't worth the wait - the Caesar salad was browning, and poorly presented. We had to walk elsewhere to continue our meal.We will not return.
4385;No.Excited and optimistic about the positive reviews, I decided to venture to Vecchia with a guest.When I asked the server if there is a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon available he decided to correct my pronunciation. Mind you, I know my wines and he repeated the type of wine exactly how I pronounced it to him. My date and I, also the table next to us laughed about it. We brushed it off and found it to be amusing yet distasteful. When the food came our experience rapidly declined. Bland, unseasoned, mediocre, poorly plated dishes. Our food was barely touched.The only positive is that the decor is intimate and the bathrooms are spacious and clean. But when it comes to food I prefer satisfactory courses over ambiance. I won't return.
4386;Please do no waste your money here!  I came with a friend on a Friday night. Since it was my first time there I wanted to go over the menu and decide what I wanted however my friend soley came there for the fish. When the waiter came around to take our order she told him to take her order because I was still deciding. He took so long to come back (20 mins later!!) that when he took my order the fish had sold out! My friend was livid. The waiter did not even offer an apology and then turned around and blamed me! He said because he had to come back since I wanted more time to decide that it was my fault the fish sold out. I wanted to get up and leave. Never had I been to a restaurant and been insulted like that. We ended up staying which we both regret. The food was ok i've definately had WAY better Italian food and especially with the prices on the menu I expected much tastier food. Plus the waiter did not check on us once and we had to ask another waiter just to give us bread that we noticed that everyone el
4387;Lacks professionalism is responding to complaints and the ability for their employees to respect their clients. Will not be returning.
4388;If I could give this place a zero star, I would. I'd like to start by saying I have eaten here number of times (once on my birthday) without a problem and frankly I enjoyed the food and service, but my experience tonight has made me question my prior dining experiences here. I came with a friend (who has eaten here before), sat, order and just as we began to eat I looked down at her place and saw TWO THICK BLACK HAIRS. And these were not short hairs either, they were at least 6 inches long, noticeable and mixed into the noodle dish. We both regret that we didn't take a photo of it, it was absolutely awful! Mind you my friend has long BROWN hair and I have BLUE hair so there is not way it was either of ours.We brought it to the wait staffs attention and she immediately apologized and replaced the dish, but that's not it. We both are nearing the end of our dishes when my friend taps me on the shoulder and point to her plate (she basically finished the dish) which once again has TWO MORE HAIRS IN IT (we took
4389;Amount of soup and meat is very low, I'd say lowest around taste of soup is also not the best,If someone likes very nice soup try at Keele & Wilson just near beer store
4390;Ive been there twice and i will never go again after the second experience. First off, service is horrible. The first time i went, i ordered the 612 vegetarian pho soup with veggies. Halfway through eating the meal, i found a dead fly just swimming in the middle of the soup, and then 2 minutes later i found ANOTHER FLY. It made me sick and i immediately stopped eating, paid and left. I decided to give it a try a second time about a month later and ordered the same vegetarian noodle soup and this time i had found a little chuck of meat that was half pink/half brown and you could see the shred texture of the beef. That was it. Being a vegetarian, i thought this was unacceptable. The food is not clean (regardless whether you get meat or veggie or seafood) and it can make people sick. Stay away people, please.
4391;Came back recently and had the bun bo hue.A bit of a letdown, as there was too much spicy chili oil in the soup.  Usually, a good bun bo hue shouldn't be overly powerful that it masks the subtle flavors like lemongrass, shrimp paste in the soup.    I've a feeling the soup came from pho soup base, sprinkled with bun bo hue soup powder (yes, you can get the soup base in powder form) and then the chili oil was added to mask the pho taste?  However, gf had pho as she cannot for the life of her eat anything remotely spicy - you could smell the pho coming from a mile away.  I had a stomach ache from the super spicy bowl of bun bo hue for almost 2 days.  Note to self: do not order it again next time.And oh, found out that this place opened last November of 2013.  It's now my 2nd go to place for good pho!1 star rating for this review cuz of the killer stomach aching bun bo hue!
4392;The place is old, not very clean &  I have had better food off a coffee truck! Never ever will we go back!
4393;Pretty bad place. The fries where horrid, done in super old oil where your fries come dark and you can taste the oil. The coleslaw was ok, but was very watery. I got the roast beef, but to be honest it tasted like pastrami and was super salty. He wasn't very generous with the mustard, had to ask for more.
4394;Really wish this place was better since I live nearby, but their pho is so watery and bland it's a shame.  Meat was over cooked and really hard to chew.  It is amazing that they even got that wrong.  It looks like business is not doing so great here so to save money they sacrifice good quality food, which in turn loses more customers and more cost cutting.  Tried it a few times since it's so close and really gave it a chance, but it's pretty awful.
4395;Inconsistent food quality.   I never knew what I would get I might have considered going back.
4396;Horrible Thai place, ordered mango salad & stir fried chicken with rice. Chicken tasted stale. They even charged me for the food that wasn't consumable.Tried this place based on the reviews but looks like they are staged too.
4397;It was a nightmare!The place is small not even worth the money.1)Poor service and the food you order doesn't come out and they have a small limited of dishes.-I have to ask few times the waitress when is my food coming n why it didnt come out.. they dont even tell u why? 2)The rolls are huge they come in 6-8 pieces which the resturant want you tonget full and leave. Dont try their rolls it a stomach filler.If your hungry dont go here you wont get your food (serve )!They felt guilty for lack of service it was reflected on the bill they give you 10% off.The presentation first dish of sashimi looks amazing after that they give up n just throw a bunch of sashimi looks like scrap fish.I was upset for the slow serviceAsking for napkin which never receive.I wont be coming back here .
4398;I don't want to sound so harsh but this place seems like a wannabe authentic German place opened up by hipster Canadians but it works in Toronto because there is no real competition nearby. Yes, there are German/Austrian dishes on the menu, but better Spätzle can be had in Etobicoke (middle of nowhere), Schnitzel doesn't even have air bubbles between the meat and the bread coating (to the owners: if you are reading this please watch some videos on YouTube on 'how to make authentic wienerschnitzel'). For what you get, it's expensive and doesn't remind me of Germany but I can see how people would think this place is cool. As for beer: $9.50 for a bottle of erdinger weissbier is a very "stolz" price. Maybe that's a reasonable price for queen st. hipster standards, I don't know. In closing I seriously question people who gave this place 5 stars..
4399;Got a chicken Schworm a wrap smelled horrible looked horrible had like no chickenDid not ask me what condiments I want on the swarm decided to put onions whatever he felt was needed. Go somewhere else or very wise as to what u pick.
4400;Be careful those who order any type of chicken . I was a regular customer ,I go about 6 to 7 times a month . They served rotten smelly chickens.I got sick ended up at ER rouge valley hospital.On top the don't accept there mistake ..give it a try yourself Also they charge so much for so little food compare to all other Afghan food.
4401;Worst service - owner and the 'hostess' are despicable. We saw them drop a part of our food and try to put it back on our plate. I can only imagine what goes on in the kitchen.

4403;Gluten-free review:I used to love going here for their gluten-free brownies until I became very ill from them. I had been eating their brownies for months without any problems. Then one day I went in to buy a brownie and double checked with the person behind the counter if the brownies were gluten-free. They confirmed it was. I always ask this just to be sure. So I take my brownie home and dig into it. This time I noticed it was slightly less dense than normal, but I was in brownie heaven and literally scarfed it down. And then...uh oh...my insides started to die a very painful death. I mean holy shit, I had forgotten how bad my reactions were to eating gluten because I've been pretty good at avoiding it. After the firey, stabbing pain to get that bastard out of my body, I was out for the count for the next two days. After I recovered I sent the store a message letting them know that their brownie made me very sick and they should double check to make sure that their gluten-free products are actually gl
4404;Overcooked and dry, couldn't even finish my burger. these reviews have to be biased to get you through the door. $10 wasted.
4405;I just came this morning to have lunch 'coz i'm starving. I ended going away, again for bad customer sevice. I had a bad experience with this place a long time ago but I did not post a review, because maybe they just started and maybe does not know much of customer service. My coworker and I one time ordered food and sat on an empty spot, although there is a cup of tim hortons on the table. I thought it is another customer's cup and just left it there for some reason, but nobody else aside from us was in there. So i put the cup on the other table. The lady who took our order just went yapping that I was not suppose to do that because it is hers. I said sorry and I did not know, but she just still won't stop talking. She was saying that it is THEIR spot. So we just transferred to another table. Lady is very rude. Foodwise, burnt burger, dry, nothing special.Oh yeah, this morning, i said i will give it a try. Maybe the lady in front managed to improve and I want to try if the burger is ok now. However, upon a
4406;I had their veg thali.  the curry and rice were ok.  They gave me fresh naan which was nice but I felt like I didn't have enough good veg food to eat it with. I also got some vegetable masala and I didn't care for it.  And their spinach tofu - I did not like at all.  I didn't care for the salad either.I also had their rice pudding.  I just don't like indian rice pudding I guess. It just doesn't taste fresh to me perhaps because of the method in making it or some kind of spice they use in it. It just didn't sit with me well. I regretted eating it.  I needed to flush it out of me.
4407;Went there for lunch on whim and ordered tandoori chicken. Food was absolutely bland I could barely stomach it. Worst Indian food I have ever tasted. On the plus side staff were friendly but that can't compensate for the awful food.
4408;VEGETARIANS BEWARE: My girlfriend  and I ordered takeout. She ordered 2 vegetarian rolls with no egg (vegan) and a miso soup and salad. I ordered a spicy combo of Spicy Salmon/Tuna rolls. We paid and waited. Waitress offers mini crunchy noodle soup while we wait. Very nice of her. I ask if its vegetarian. The waitress says "Yes, but theres fish in it." My gf says "no thank you, I can't eat fish" so she offers not to put Unagi sauce on her takeout vegetarian rolls. I am dumbfounded that there is eel sauce on vegetarian rolls but we thank her for not adding it. She brings the takeout and says "have a nice day.. oh by the way, the miso soup has fish broth"So we wasted a good miso soup because this place did not have the courtesy to offer my gf something else vegetarian, but instead found out she doesn't eat fish and *still* had the nerve to charge us for a fish soup. Food was not up to par for the ~$20 for 2 very basic vegetarian rolls. The side salad was laughably sparse. My 2 spicy rolls were chopped up sp
4409;My boyfriend and I decided to go to FuZen for dinner last week based on the positive reviews we had read. Upon arrival, the place looked nice inside, and we were immediately given menus. We decided to order the 40 piece sashimi platter. When it came to the table, the sushi chef had decided to give us 20 pieces of salmon, and a few other options to make up the other 20 pieces in the platter (one of them being FAKE CRAB MEAT, which I have NEVER had included in a sashimi platter). My boyfriend questioned the 20 pieces of salmon in the platter, literally counting out the 20 pieces and asked if they had any other kinds of fish, such as octopus, surf clam, yellowtail, etc. We were told that this was how the platter came, with no substitutions. My boyfriend then told them that it seemed kind of ridiculous that half the sashimi platter consisted of salmon. The sushi chef grudgingly took the platter back, and replaced five pieces of the salmon with some of the other types of fish already in the platter, which still le
4410;I was very disappointed after ordering the tuna combination platter. The tuna sashimi was very thin and a little dry, and the roll was completely tasteless. This was my first time there and I don't like to judge when I get take out, but I was thoroughly disappointed. Much prefer Miyaki Sushi on the esplanade.
4411;First time trying this place tonight because of the good reviews on Yelp. I ordered a salmon teriyaki dinner and eel & avocado roll for take out. Upon opening the clam-shell box of sushi roll I was disappointed. It was tiny and sloppy looking. I thought maybe it tastes good without the look. The eels were mushy like a paste. I couldn't tell that was eel if it wasn't the unagi sauce. Move on to the main, the salmon was way overlooked and I chewed it like I was eating meat (if I wanted meat I'd order chicken teriyaki!). The salmon was tasteless itself beside drenched with teriyaki sauce on a bed of raw cabbage.The edamame is the same, tasteless. Not even a single grain of salt. They are completely skipping out seasoning the food by soaking them with store bought sauces and totally cheap out on the quantity and quality of food. I wasn't expecting authentic Japanese food and know well most sushi places are run by not Japanese Asians. But even with this knowledge it's just terrible tasting and small portio
4412;I had high hopes for this place after reading the reviews on urbanspon. The place looks nice and clean. My GF and I decided to order the 40 piece sashimi platter. When it came to the table the sushi chef had plopped down 20 pieces of salmon with only a few other options to make up the rest of the 40 pieces. HALF of a 40 piece platter was all the same kind of fish!!?? I have never seen this done before at ANY sushi place and I have been to hundreds over the years including Japan. This is just pure laziness. People order a sashimi platter to get verity. There was no octopus,surf clam.squid, yellowtail etc. I brought it to the attention of the waitress who just said there are no substitutions. I counted out to her all 20 salmon pieces and said "don't you have any octopus, surf clam or squid? We like salmon but 20 pieces is kinda ridiculous" She took it back and the lazy chef just gave us five more of the bad snapper ...(which was not snapper btw) and left us with 15 slices of salmon. Had I known the fish would b
4413;June14, 2017Two For One PizzaHeadquarters77 Progress AvenueToronto, OntarioM1P 2Y7Tel: (416)-646-0987operations@241pizza.comIt has been many years that I go to your Two For One Pizza, location on Bloor Street West & Havelock Street, in Toronto, and in particular I am going there every Tuesday for the past few months as they offer special deal Tuesdays. There is a Korean, or Japanese (male) employee at the service desk that doesn't like me. He refused to serve me in the past, about few months ago, and this is what happened yesterday, on June 13, 2017: I went to get the pepperoni combo with bottle of water. As I was waiting in the line, king line, about ten people ahead if me, notably the man was serving everyone with fresh slices that were coming just out of the owen, but when I got to be served the man grabbed a flat slices our of the window. So, I asked him whether he was going to give me the fresh slices? The man yelled at me and said they are all fresh... I told him that I preferred the out 
4414;Took me several tries to make a reservation since they don't return calls. Finally made a reservation for 4 people at 6pm on a April Monday night to celebrate my sister and my birthday with my parents. When we arrived there were only 2 tables seated and we were the 3rd. Within the first 1/2 hour the restaurant was packed. After we arrived we were given our table then nothing... as tables arrived around us and got drink orders and meals ordered. Nothing... At around 645 I had to approach someone because no one even looked our way (we are in the middle of the dining room) the older gentleman said someone will be with you..there was only 2 servers, so I flagged the only other waiter and asked to at least put our drink order in. He said he'd be back after he put an order in but he wasn't and eventually the older waiter came back.... We ordered 6 apps, 4 entrees and 4 desserts. At quarter past 7 still no appetizers. An hour and 15 minutes after we arrive we finally had someone come by and say the food will b
4415;Unfriendly staff. I really wanted to like this place so I came by for two separate mornings maybe about two weeks apart and was faced with probably the most rude and unwelcoming customer service I have ever encountered. It was super disappointing because this place seemed really great and my friend had recommended it too. Will never go back or recommend it to others. Coffee was just okay as well. If you're overworked and tired, then please take it out on your friends or manager. Not your customers.
4416;STAY AWAY!  They re-serve discarded guest's pizza.  I ordered a pizza from them and it came cold and mysteriously covered in an insane amount of arugula, even though there was not supposed to be any on it.  When I uncovered the pizza from the ridiculous amount of leaves, one quarter had smoked chicken and onions, and the other 3 did not.  There was not supposed be either ingredient in my pizza.  I could easily see that the slices did not line up either.  I could also see footprints of toppings peeled off from the other slices.  Shortly after  my discovery the waiter came by to take the pizza away and said he would take it off the bill - without me actually even saying anything.  How could they knowingly serve me discarded pizzas??  These guys should be shut down for their shady business practices...not only are people getting ripped off, they could be getting sick from eating other people's thrown away pizzas!!
4417;I'm Not too sure where all of these great reviews came from because my boyfriend and I went tonight and we were thoroughly unimpressed. We made reservations for 6:00pm, and when we arrived we were sat at a table near the door. All was fine until a couple walked in. The waiter then came over to us and informed us that we had to move because the couple who came in after preferred that particular table. So rude! We were then brought to a table in the back and were sat beside a huge, loud party. My boyfriend and I ordered a pizza each and one drink to share. The server completely forgot about our drink and when we reminded him he then laughed about it with another server. The pizza itself was mediocre at best. It was soggy and lacking in flavour. The chilli oil was the only thing that saved it. Also, You can see right into the kitchen and the female cook was dressed way inappropriately. Her stomach was out and the tag from her thong was sticking out from her pants! Unprofessional. The music was so loud you can't 
4418;I would avoid this place at all costs. The food was over priced and not very good at all. Good cocktail menu though so if you want a drink that could be a spot. The part for me that will ensure I never go back is the service. The manager treated customers very poorly and was rude and arrogant. While waiting inside we let them know a group of 15 people (mix of races) were waiting to get into the bar for a birthday. While outside, I watched the bouncers and the manager let in about 25 other people that fit, in what he described in his words "our profile" while the others waited to a point they simply left. Of course we headed out as well and will never go back.Really unfortunate as this city and specifically the Market is a welcoming area for all. To turn away a group of 35-40yrs old who clearly wanted to spend at your establishment for dinner and drinks all due to the color of their skin was just wrong and something you wouldn't expect to see in this day and age. Hopefully they remember the city they opera
4419;This restaurant may have been excellent a few years back. But what I experienced as a take-out customer was dismal. I cannot comment on their service, but from where I stood the place looked clean yet empty. I ordered Beef Kabobs/Chicken Breast Kabob and Tandoori Chicken Kabobs to go with Rice. I took the food home and found my order was correct but I think the food shrunk. Their Beef Kabob's are the size of a small Chocolate Bar and their Chicken Kabob's are bite size. What a dissapointment, I would'nt recommend anyone this restaurant even if it was the last Afgan grill in mississauga. In my humble opinion, for a restaurant to be great success the food must always outshine the decor or even customer service. I request readers to try other Afgani restaurants. Watan Kabob for sure or Naan & Kabob or Bamiyan Kabob are just a few excellent restaurants in Mississauga.
4420;Although their food may be medicore, which it was, nothing special. The service was beyond terrible, our waitress asked for our orders like she was doing US a favour. When my friend asked for some yogurt, because CLEARLY, their Aush could use more yogurt, she rolled her eyes at us and was so hesitent like it was going to make or break their resturants profit (mind you, our many orders of food could feed a village, so lady, IM SURE IT WASNT GOING KILL YOUR BUSINESS IF U GAVE US SOME YOGURT, even if u wanted to charge us money for that). We then asked for starws which she said yes, and never gave. P.S. Please drop by a pakistani resturant to know how REAL BIRYANI tastes like before you go offering such bland tasteless rice on the menu and calling it "Biryani". Perhaps it was just our bad luck with the AUNTY WAITRESS we got, who could seriously GROW UP, with her childish attitude. Lady please, if you dont want to serve food, go home and knit or sew, but dont be in a customer service business, its bad for busines
4421;This place deserves no stars. I've had two terrible experiences. The first bad experience was when a large order ahead of me was missing a pizza order and so they gave the large group my pizza. Which meant I had to wait for a new pizza to be made for my order. I complained and got a coupon for my next pizza. This second time, a large group was before and after me, and somehow my order was pulled out of the queue and behind both orders. I walked out because I wasnt going to wait for 5 pizzas to get baked before mine. This place is not worth the effort.
4422;I ate here twice when it was called One Pizza, it was amazing. I'm sure the pizza is still great. But, Yelp shows that the restaurant is open until 11 PM. I walked there with a friend a few minutes ago because I didn't want to order Dominoes or other garbage. It was closed when we got there at 10:30 PM. The owner should contact Yelp to correct this. Still, very inconvenient hours.
4423;Would have loved to try this pizzeria, but their business model is atrocious. They're losing business left, right, and center - I called multiple times during peak business hours and was shuttled to voicemail each time. Too bad as they could have had a new regular customer in the neighbourhood, and I'm sure I'm not the only business they've lost.
4424;Dirty, the person behind the counter handles the money and touch's the food.Bad costumer services, the debit machine doesn't work, and forces you to the atm next door (extra $3) to pay.Rude employee, calls the costumer cheap for not wanting to pay a $3 fee for the atm. (You should warn the costumer that the machine is not working before he orders)The pizza it self was alright, but after seeing how dirty, and how rude the employee is. I will never come again.
4425;I've been meaning to go to Chito's for awhile after hearing about it a few years ago I finally went. It's shawarma on pizza - what could go wrong? Unfortunately, it was a HUGE disappointment - the garlic sauce was neither garlicky or saucy, it was super salty, and the hot sauce was nothing special. The chicken shawarma itself was dry and chopped up to minced proportions. Overall, I'm in shock that they could mess up shawarma!Pros:- Cheap - $2.50 for shawarma pizza sliceCons:- The garlic sauce was too salty and didn't taste like garlic- The chicken shawarma was dry and chopped up weirdNote: One of my friends said it was amazing, and a second friend's second slice looked a little better. Maybe it's hit or miss, but I wouldn't give it a second chance even if it only cost me $2.50.
4426;I ordered chicken and waffles. The meal suggests I eat chicken and waffles together... My plate comes 15 mins after I order. Chicken tastes amazing. The waffles are overcooked, dry as the desert and hard as bricks. If fact the desert had more moisture than these waffles. I asked for replacement waffles and it's currently 30 mins wait and still no waffles. Chicken is cold now and I've eaten chicken with no waffles. Waffles finally come they are a little bit better... I guess i can say I had chicken with a side order of waffles.
4427;I will definitely never visit again. The service is sucks.  The waiter doesn't care about you. I don't think the food is good enough to let me come back again. If there has zero star, I will rate it to zero!!! Bad experience!!!
4428;These people are chronically rude. terrible customer service. If you don't intend to ask any questions or clarifications then you wouldn't notice. Btw the sweets aren't freshly made
4429;really disappointed with the service here. came here for dessert as the Keg didn't have what we wanted. We wanted a booth but because one wasn't available we were left at the high top tables - and we waited for about 40 minutes before someone even came back around even though we asked a few times (which included asking for water.) finally after being ready to walk out after seeing a booth was available we were seated. We asked the server to take our order right away as we've been waiting for a while but he still walked away and took his time coming back.we placed our order as we already waited but decided never to come back to horrible service like this again.
4430;Arrived at demetres to meet a friend who was already waiting to get seated for at least 10 minutes ... after we arrived ... waited another 15 minutes to secure a seat for three ... me and my wife are regulars at demetres ... so we don't look at the menu .. we order right away.Asked the person who seated us that we are ready to order ... he said no problem, he will send our server ... about a minimum of 10 minutes passed by ... the same person who seated us said he could not find our server and therefore he will take our order ... so knowing what exactly I wanted ... I go to order my crepe ... with strawberries ... apparently they didn't have strawberries ... when asked why? The response was it's not the season and our supplier didn't have them ... ok ... fair enough. .. I was kind of upset as this is my regular crepe .... my wife convinced me to get apples instead .. I agreed and asked the waiter to put apples on the side ... my wife and our friend ordered hot drinks ... The 2 hot drinks come within 10 m
4431;I hate Demetres with a fiery passion usually reserved for things that actually matter, not opinions on restaurants. Unfortunately, I have friends that inexplicably love this place and so I am back time and time again...Here's a list of terrible things about Demetres:- The place is way too small and always packed. There is often a line-up outside the door and they have NO system to manage this. None. No hostess, no hostess desk, no pagers, no pen and paper, they rarely acknowledge you, it is incredibly confusing to know who's next, the wait time, etc. And all staff always seem flustered that they are this busy as if it's never happened before. How can a place so consistently busy not invest in ONE hostess to manage this?- The service in general is just bad. Tables are rarely served their desserts at the same time and there is often a long gap between the first and last person at your table getting their plate. When you're dealing so often in ice cream, this can be a problem- The pricing is absurd. Their p
4432;Cannot complain about the amazing crepes or sweet treats! The service and management on the orher hand requires major improvement. After dinner with friends on Friday night we decided to go for dessert knowing it would be busy. We enter the establishment at around 9:00pm.We were a party of 8.Customers were lined up and waiting. In line there was a couple already waiting 20 minutes for table, when a party of 5 came in and was seated right away in a booth.The couple asked to speak to the manager.The manager came over with a explanation that it was his policy to make customers comfortable and on a busy night he could not seat two people at a table that would accommodate the larger parties.Although the couple was not happy they waited for a smaller table. From a business prospective I too would want a larger group to bring in a profit, however what happened next was a real disappointment.The head waitress informed us that the booth she was going to seat us at had been occupied by the managers friends 
4433;I called them at 10.30 saying ill be there in 15 minutes given they close at 11. When I arrived with a party of 15 ( which I mentioned on the phone) they denied me and were extremely rude. Lack of professionalism and courtesy.
4434;horrible wings they are not lightly dusted.  The service was good and so was the lemonade
4435;The worst experience I've had in a restaurant in Toronto. While the food was good, the service was absolutely appalling. I am still in shock as I write this review. I went with a date to this place last night. I won't go into all of the details, but I will say that the waitress and the manager were both incredibly rude and unprofessional in making us feel incredibly rushed to order and get out of there for their next round of people. It has been a long while since I've been anywhere where I felt this kind of pressure that was conveyed in such a rude manner. I was at Buca a few weeks where it's pretty hard to get a reservation unless it's awhile in advance, and where they are always fully booked, and the waitress gave me and my friend plenty of time to make each of our decisions and fully enjoy our meal. I will not be frequenting this restaurant ever again, and will be letting my friends know to avoid it. I think they really need to understand that people go out to eat (especially on a date) to enjoy themselve
4436;The food was great and our hostess was soo sweet. It was though my first time to take my folks there and they came out of town. Unfortunately one of the waitress was very rude with my dad which was totally unacceptable. I didnt say anything as i didnt want to ruin the atmosphere but she was extremely rude.What a disappointing experience and was so bothered that i took my folks there.
4437;If you want good food, come here.If you want good food and good service, avoid this restaurant.After reading some of the reviews, it seems as though it's hit and miss with Tabule. The food is good - I'll give it that (at least the dips, I'll give it that). The service is absolutely abhorrent - so much that I will never return.Arrived for our 7:15 reservation. We were promptly seated. About 15-20 minutes after we were seated, we were finally asked what we wanted to order. We gave our food and drink order and asked for 2 glasses of water - which was odd, since most restaurants fill your water when you are seated. 30 minutes after we were seated, we finally got our glasses of water, and this was only because I had asked the server a second time for the water.35 minutes AFTER ordering our dinners, the server returns to tell me that my meal is not available. To put this into perspective, this is now 50 minutes after being seated. Now, I get that restaurants run into issues with food, etc. But I expect to be
4438;1: Poor2: OK3: Good4: Very Good5: ExcellentTook my husband for lunch here today.  Epic fail.  We had the babaganuj, tabule, labni, cauliflower, falafel, and kubbeh.  Babaganuj (1/5)-Did not like it at all.Tabule (1/5)-Did not like it.Labni (2/5)-Ok.Cauliflower (1/5)-GreasyFalafel (3/5)-Good.  But  I am not going to a restaurant just for a falafel.  Kubbeh (0/5)-Very wheaty after-taste.  Small.  Not meaty.  The food was awful and I have eaten middle eastern food practically all my life.  The only thing I liked was the falafel.  And I don't know why everyone was ranting about the cauliflower it was just deep fried with tahini poured on top.  It tasted like greasy cauliflower.  And the kubbeh was heavy on the bulgur.  They were so small and barely any meat.  I was irritated by their menu.   My husband was disgusted by one of the waitresses whom was hugging someone and playing with a dog and went to serve people food without washing her hands.  My husband hated the food there and felt
4439;Very average food. Food took 40 minutes to come out, despite only three other tables being served in the restaurant. People are very nice. Atmosphere is good.
4440;I understand this is a local joint and that the prices are extremely fair, but that is no excuse for the the poor quality of food I have experienced.I have given Nonna's Place two chances. I did not think it was possible to mess up making a simple sandwich, but I couldn't stomach the grilled strip-loin sandwich nor the breakfast sandwich. And as much as I hate wasting food, they both ended up in the garbage with a few bites missing.I am surprised at the good reviews. Maybe I ordered the only two duds on the menu. But two chances are all I'm willing to give this place. So long, Nonna.
4441;Never been there. Called them  to make a phone order of veg thali . Receptionist didn't know which veggies I could get . Puts me on hold comes back in 2 mins and says sorry let me go ask tgan comes back after 5 mins. Instead of giving me options of veggies so i canpick she picks it for me. Tells me I can't substitute any veggies. In Veg thali u always get options of veggies. Not sure why they have this concept. They Lost a potential customer.
4442;If you want a cold, rude and over priced food for very small portions experience this is the place :/. Long time to serve customers no friendliness nothing.This place simply sucks.
4443;I would stay away from this restaurant. I went there just by myself , with no reservation and they told me it would take, at least 45 minutes. 4 other business guys, very well dressed and with no reservation, got a table within 2 minutes. What would you call to this?
4444;This was my second time here, the first was a few years ago. This time we came here with a party of 4 (my wife and her parents), 2 were celebrating birthdays. We had reservations for 5pm but got here a couple minutes after 4:50 but because they open exactly at 5 we weren't allowed in and had to wait outside in the zub zero temperatures, while I saw the staff just standing around talking. After walking to Yonge St and standing on the corner looking at all the restaurants for a minute or two, now in retrospect we should've just gone to one of those, we walked back to Adega and were thankfully allowed to enter out of the cold.They originally wanted to seat us at a booth but because one member of our group is claustrophobic we asked for a table instead. I could've sworn I mentioned this when I made the reservation but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say maybe I didn't. The waiter said they were fully booked but he'd go check. He came back in a minute and seated us at a table. Funny thing was, by the
4445;Winterlicious Review - Don't bother with the Winterlicious lunch menu, not worth the money or time.My friend and I were excited to try Adega and figured we'd stop by for Winterlicious. Worst decision ever.SERVICEI arrived early and was seated relatively quickly but I had to wait for my friend. The waiter kept coming by to the table and asked if my friend arrived. I told him she will be here in 15 minutes (ie: the actual time of the booking) and that we'd need some time before ordering. My friend sat down, barely had a sip of water or even time to look at the menu and the waiter was looming over our shoulders trying to see what we would like to order. No walkthrough of the menu or recommendations when I asked what he would suggest off the Winterlicious menu. FOODI've never been so upset to want to send food back to the kitchen. Sloppy presentation and bland food. I even mentioned it to the waiter. We were both starving and upset after the lunch.We got:Seafood Bisque with Dungeness Crab Aioli [flavou
4446;Had to wait 10 minutes for fast food. Just an annoyance on top of the bad food. Ordered the Tori Karaage and the chicken tasted off. Chicken was not fresh! Fearing possible food poisoning I got out of there fast.
4447;Small portion size.  Curry was way to sweet and the lady gave me only a ladle of the curry which barely covered half of the rice. After seeing all the good reviews about this place I decided to give it a try. Disappointing. Would not visit again.
4448;Sooooooo...The food here was pretty good, service was atrocious. Too bad because this place had been on my list for a while. We arrived right at the beginning of a huge wave of people. We were easily identifiable as we were the only party with non-Asian people and who spoke to the owners in English (my obsessive hovering made me privy to this information). The person taking the orders spoke in very broken limited English, but we all managed. Then, when the line dissipated and the food still hadn't come, we decided to grab a table in the food court. About 15 minutes later, someone came out to give food to one of the tables, we indicated that it was ours, but so did another table (who had ordered after us, but had spoken to him in whatever language they were speaking), and they were served first. I went up to the owner and told him that we had ordered the same thing first, but he brushed me off and said our food was coming. This happened 2 more times and every time I went up to the owner and tried to inqu
4449;Every time I buy food here its always bad. Like its smells bad and taste sour. It's been 5 times in a row their food is consistently disgusting. I wont recommend this for everyone. They're cheap that they save their food from previous day and serve it the next day. It's like they dont care if you get sick from their food.
4450;My friend wanted to meet here. Bad choice. I jut tried this place for the first time... And i want u to keep in mind that i like most restaurants... I have to say this jerk is reallllly bad. I don't reccomend it for a taste food!
4451;I got the jerk chicken special. The rice was over cooked and mushy. The jerk chicken was very bland not very spicey. This place is overrated don't waste your money. I did.
4452;I remember this place to have some decent jerk but I think something must have changed as sadly its the worst in memory.  The rice and peas are dry like the bones that most of this chicken consists of.  There is very little flavour to the jerk and the gravy is nonexistent.    If your a fan of good pipping hot and moist full flavoured jerk with delicious gravy smothering some rice and peas, skip this one.  Unfortunately,  the food from this spot is as fresh and disgusting as the environment it's served in.
4453;While visiting for Caribana  2015, I make a trip to Mr. Jerk for curry goat.  With the exchange rate being .75 to $1.00 local, I expected to pay less using US Dollars but was informed by the woman behind the counter it dollar for dollar.  In previous years when the exchange rate was flipped she had no problem using a calculator to make sure I paid the difference.   The meal was good but my friends and I will not be returning.  Especially when we were able to use cards every other place so there was no reason to convert money for a three day trip.
4454;First review of a restaurant so lets give this a shot:My family and I decided to go to Ferraros on a Saturday night, BIG mistake. We realized this instantly as we walked in the front door only to find another 5 other parties stuffed into a tiny waiting area waiting for a table. After 15 minutes, we got a table only to find out that we were essentially sitting in a kids section. The atmosphere was incredibly loud and hectic. Waiters running everywhere. In terms of the food, we ordered a large Caesar salad. Now I don't expect a lot from a Caesar salad but you would expect an Italian restaurant to use a salad dressing that does not directly resemble a store boat Caesar.The pizza we ordered was good, nothing spectacular and quite burnt on the bottom.All an all we vowed we would stay away from the Ferraros dine in experience and opt for the takeout option if we dared venture back.
4455;The service is quite good. The waiter is friendly. Food is not to par with the ratings. I believe the high ratings come from the generous portion sizes. The portions are quite big.As someone who has eaten at many restaurants this one didnt live up to expectations. The bread is ice cold, the food is quite bland.  At the end of the meal they bring you bubble gum, the kind you has as a kid, rock hard.For our dishes we ordered the portobello pizza which lacked flavour. My friend ordered the baked eggplant which had way 2 much sauce. For the pasta we had the chicken fettachini which the pasta sauce didn't stick out.If you are looking for a great Italian place to eat that is at the same price range with better tasting food. Go to seven numbers 2 doors down.
4456;Ugh went in here and there wasn't even a hi, hello, how are you? They just looked at me and gave me a deep stare in my eyes. Bought 12 honey balls, they asked if I wanted cinnamon I said ok bought it for 3 dollars went back to my car and it was cold as hell. And also just before I left after I bought my honey balls someone was coming in and she looked more "greek" than I did and the cashier says hi how are you to her. At that moment was my last. Treat all your customers the same and you would get a lot more business besides the 2 people that were only in there. These greek people are racist.
4457;Over an hour and a half wait with no explanation until we asked twice and they said they forgot about our order second time around. Many other great options in the area!
4458;SUper slow service, and when I was almost finished my sandwich I noticed the bread was moldy. At that point I was to frustrated by the long wait to bother saying anything. I paid my bill and left.I will never return.
4459;I got this place to deliver from Doordash ( a new delivery company) and I was excited to try it out. As soon as I open the food everything looked over cooked...... Sausages were literally black and extremely burnt.. Home fries looked over cooked aswell. Extremely disappointed won't be eating here again.
4460;The ladies who make the sandwiches are rude and the lady boss/cashier is even more rude. I guess the foot soldiers follow the commander.
4461;So, this is a tiny little restaurant that only seats 6-8 ppl. Most of all the biz is take-out. The food that I had was not good. I ordered an off-menu item based on the word of another patron. It was the Cajun Burger that came with fries. The salt count for the burger was off the scale!! There was so much salt, it burned my tongue. I asked for the fries to be crispy...they weren't. They even had an off brand ketchup!! It wasn't good.I ordered a biscuit as well & it was hard. They ONLY redeeming part was the Mac & Cheese. It was good but not great as stated. With the exception of the M&C I threw most of it away. :( This is NOT a do-over for me & I won't go again.
4462;I think this place might only be good for its poutine cuz' the fries sucked. I went to this placed based off of Susan C's review and was let down. These fries were very mushy and greasy. Plain and simple. Would never recommend this unless you .... nope can't think of a reason to recommend this place. Sorry!
4463;I would rather roll around in diarrhea then eat here, that doesen't even make sense as a substitute for eating food but I would rather do that then eat here.my fries had.. bone in them or something. Now I understand why I see people vomiting so much in Nathan Phillips Square.If you're really hungry try eating one of the pigeons walking around near the truck, I think I've noticed that even they have enough taste to mostly avoid the food from this truck.this goes for all the chip trucks on this little strip
4464;Terrible Service!!! Arrived and was seated but was not given menus. Waited 15 minutes while 3 other groups were seated and given menus. After 20 minutes with no menus we got up and left.
4465;Food was disgusting. I have NO idea how this place has as many stars as it does?! People must not know good food! The lobster is frozen, I repeat: FROZEN. The lobster Mac and cheese is more like lobster in a soupy powder cheese sauce. And the bisque is soggy and just straight up unappetizing. If you're in the mood for fresh lobster, I would suggest Smoked & Cracked instead. Don't waste your money here.
4466;Came here for dinner and should've been tipped off by the near empty dining room. I will say the service is good and the waitress was very friendly and helpful but the positives end there. I don't know if this place thinks that seafood needs to taste like it's still in the ocean  but everything was insanely salty like the chef dumped the whole box in there. We had the cheesy lobster dip and the mussels and we're disappointed by how quality protein was disrespected by salting the living hell out of it in addition to being overcooked and chewy like rubber. The lobster then came with about half a pound of nasty red lobster eggs still in there with some brown crud which I mistakenly thought was seasoning but which I fear was something a lot more like the lobsters last meal... thank God the lobster wasn't too salty but the margarine instead of butter dip was again, full of salt. Bottom line, this place is expensive, and the food isn't nearly good enough to warrant the prices, we had high hopes but we all left disa
4467;This was one of the worst meals we have ever had in Toronto - and we've had quite a few. I have never left a bad review of *anything* online but I couldn't let this one go.We couldn't get a table at Stack (which is amazing) a few doors down, so we decided to try Lobster Monster. It was unbelievably bad. The kids' meals were halfway decent but:- the garlic bread was basically a bunch of hamburger buns with garlic butter on them- the fries were the same frozen McCain processed fries that they serve at cheap cafes at Harbourfront- the salad was overdressed and gross- the kids' hamburger was dry and overcooked- the CORN was undercooked (it is not difficult to cook corn on the cob. come on.)- the actual lobster we got was awful. It had the bitter aftertaste of a lobster that hasn't been cooked properly. The claws were stunted and deformed and the shell was mostly empty (the explanation was that the lobster was at a particular point in its moulting cycle, which - I don't know? But as a fair bit of the weig
4468;One of the worst restaurants I have been to in a long time.Firstly, I went with a few friends, and the place demonstrated its lack of interest in providing good customer service right off the bat. This is because of that fact that just before we ordered we asked for separate bills: however the waitress informed us that they "don't do separate bills." A restaurant having the policy of not allowing its customers to have separate bills is ridicules. Also, they don't except debit which I would have found easier to deal with if the restaurant was just some "hole in the wall" sort of place.Despite their obvious lack of concern in satisfying their customers in regards to convenience I hoped the food would at least be good. They also failed in regards to this aspect as well. Everybody at the table found their skimpy dinners to be bland and tasteless. Also, for the kind of mediocre food that they gave us - and a small amount at that - the prices were far too high.The whole experience at Jerusalem stunk.
4469;This will be quick and dirty.The food was easily a 3/5. Maybe higher. We enjoyed everything we had and felt sated.The service sucked. Our large group was dealt with impatience . . . followed by clear annoyance when three chairs were left empty (we wound up with 8 instead of 11 people). The owner actually came by to tell us to hurry up at one point.That, my friends, is all you need to know about Jerusalem Restaurant. I won't be back.
4470;I don't think this is worth my $20 for All-you-can-eat. I went here with a party of four and for one thing, the male waiter spilled hot tea on a little baby and burned it's leg and the mother and baby were screaming their heads off. The belly dancer looked uninterested and only after money. She could've acted like she had some passion for the art of belly dancing.Down to the food: mediocre. The kofte kibbeh and coconut shrimp were OK, there was no lamb like I was told there'd be and the hummus and babganoush looked totally unattractive. There wasn't even any pita to eat it with. The desserts were miserable.Customer service for us was okay....but I wish the food had been better. Beautiful restaurant though. I just wish they would put a little more effort into presentation.
4471;A disaster. Twice they have told us to wait over an hour for a scheduled pickup order that was ordered hours before. A dozen other people waiting in line with the same complaint. This longstanding restaurant needs to learn how to handle their supply and demand catastrophe.
4472;Let me be clear, I rarely if ever give 2 stars to a restaurant becuase i usually go to restaurants after I checked their yelp rating and I see good reviews.Unfortunately  this time around I was extremely disappointed.I love Korean food and bulgogi is great when done right but these guys just totally messed up this thing.The first thing is the tray. They bring the combo on a tray only seen in a hospital, discusting white tray.The other thing is the items on the tray, the noodles were badly over cooked with some sauce on top that looked like it came out of a can, and sure enough it tasted like it too.There's a tiny amount of rice and several items thrown together with grey minced meat on top.So right off the bat the visuals are bad. Real bad. The taste was true to how it looks too. Average at best and for the first time in forever I didn't eat half of my food (that never happens)I'm extremely disappointed! Would give it a one star if I..Actually, I take it back. I am giving it one star.
4473;Went there with some out of town guests.  They wanted some good Korean food and we've been to the song cooks in Thornhill so we thought this one would be ok. The waiter messed up our order and brought the wrong kind or pork.  Not a big deal.  Can happen.  But the annoying part was that he blamed us and said we told him the wrong thing. Ok whatever. Like I said not a huge deal at this point.  The annoying part was that all their portions were tiny.  The Jaeyook Bokkeum was tiny.  Literally maybe five or six pieces of pork spread out on the hot plate.  We also ordered the kalbi Jim for $35 bucks.  The portion was a joke.  It was tiny and the worst part was that they still had the stickers on the green peppers included in the dish.When I reported it to the waiter he didn't care very much.  We were too embarrassed in front of our guests to make a huge deal about it and so we just let it go. Still tipped them 15 percent because it's not the waiters fault that the cook didn't wash or clean the veggies but for t
4474;Yelp lists they close at 1030. We showed up at 946, we are told they were closed (after making us stand there a couple minutes).  Mentioned they close at 10.Waste of our time,  chaban a better option. I don't like being turned away, won't return.
4475;Should be called "Noodle Noodle Seafood soup" rather then "seafood noodle soup". Ordered the top dinner for one and got 2 bowls of noodles, one in a paste and another in the soup. 95% of dish one were noodles with a paste which wasn't bad. Second dish was 90% noodle some small pieces of squid and soup which was not not good. If I wanted just wanted to have noodles I would go buy a package of pasta from Food Basics and boil it. I find the "dinner" combo to be very ridiculous. My girlfriend's chicken cutlets were pretty good.
4476;We came here looking for a dinner as we didn't have lunch since morning.  And there was a waitress who took our orders and even asked me what type of rice we wanted with our dishes. After waiting for 15mins, we finally called another waiter over to check our order. That was when we discovered our orders was not put through!  I was really upset that we were ignored the entire time, especially when we saw mother couple who came in after us and they got their food served right away. And when I asked them what happened. The waitress who was supposedly served us didn't even admit she took the order from us.  It was clearly her fault that she was the waitress working that day. I cannot accept the ignorance of their service.
4477;Terrible. I had the tofu stew and it came out super watery. My significant other had soup as well and the same thing. When I brought the issue to the waiter, he was polite and offered to bring us new stews. The issue is this: it was too salty and spicy! I don't know why I come to this place! Way too much MSG. If after your meal, you feel like drinking lots of water? It's the MSG. Everything tastes salty but I guess that is better than it tasting bland.
4478;It would be nice if I could review their food, but I can't and I'll tell you why.They pretty much ignored me on two separate occassions when I asked about accessibility. I had to literally keep asking for information on IG and Twitter. This last time it took over FOUR days and repeated questions to get a simple answer while they retweeted other people. It should not be this hard to get a business to tell you the information that you requested. By having me ask repeatedly, they made me feel like I was being a hassle. This is NO way to run a business and I'll never go there, ever. I'll happily go to other places that are accomodating and helpful both online and offline. BTW, their bathrooms are not fully wheelchair accessible. There are no grab bars and the space is likely too small for motorized mobility equipment to turn (i.e., power chair or scooter).
4479;Ordered delivery from hurrier to try out this restaurant for the first time. And while the delivery was exactly on time, the food was sadly not great. I really wanted to love this place and have a new vegetarian spot to order from, but I'll never order again. I got a salad, French fries and the batteries tempeh. The salad was strangely already mixed with the dressing which made all the leaves entirely wilted, wet and lukewarm. I get take out salads all the time and normally the dressing is kept separate for this reason. The fries are overcooked, totally cold. The tempeh is alright, also cold but not bad in terms of texture. I still tipped as always, but apart from the tempeh, nothing is edible.
4480;Bad, slow service. We walked in, with no acknowledgement from the staff so sat ourselves at one of the empty tables and grabbed a menu that was left behind. We proceeded to wait 10 minutes but no staff came our way. There were three tables with customers who had finished eating. No one else was waiting for food... Shitty. This is the type of thing that will make this restaurant go under. Bye bye Bloomer's.
4481;Bloomer's used to be our favourite neighbourhood place for lunch (I love the mac & cheese), and I wrote an enthusiastically positive review when it first opened. Sadly, standards have slipped noticeably. On our most recent visit, service was non-existent the place was nearly empty, yet we waited and waited just for a menu. Finally we got up and fetched our own menus and placed our orders at the counter. Strike one. Strike two: the glare coming through the front window was so harsh, the lighting so unpleasant, that I could hardly read the menu, even with sunglasses. Any light-filtering blinds would easily solve the problem, but the front window remains bare and the atmosphere in the restaurant is neither pleasant nor restful. (To make matters worse, the music being played was atrocious. Even if you're a fan of heavy metal, which I'm not, is this appropriate music for a relaxing mid-day break?) Strike three: for the first time, the mac & cheese was dried-out and badly overcooked. It's so sad when your favourit
4482;I went into this place with high expectations, looking to get a warm cup of Matcha on this rainy day, when the barista  rudely corrected me saying " Let me correct you its pronounced MAKA" and I thought to myself maybe I have been or maybe she doesn't know herself, so I didn't think anything of it.A few minutes later she brought over a drink which was indeed the wrong drink, she gave me a MACA latte. Frustrated, I confronted her she insisted I was the wrong one and that a MACA latte was what I ordered. She refused to correct my order and insisted I pay for it! What kind of stubborn individual works in the customer service industry and forces people to pay for things they never ordered in the first place and makes them feel like they are in the wrong and never admit to their own lack of Cafe beverages. Will never go back, Terrible, rude Batista and service!
4483;This meal was so disappointing - sadly.  Our chicken curry dish had one piece (bone in section of a drum stick) of chicken in it (I swear).  The dumplings were in a spicy sauce (soaked in the sauce) and was more like a soup.  The noodles were the worst - plain noodles with salad on the side and some veg - we had ordered with egg and it was not added.  The beef dish was inedible - it was so tough.  We frequent thai, asian, koreen, Vietnamese restaurants - so our expectations were not too high - but wow was it disappointing.
4484;4 stars for this place? You gotta be kidding me!The food was below average to be honest. Nothing special and everything tasted bland. The service was really slow and there was six of us in the restaurant. The food came after maybe an hour and I don't understand why it would take that long for our food to come, especially if we were the only people being served. Not only that but each dish came separately and you have to wait again for maybe another 10 minutes for the next dish to come. The portions were really small and the food was just bland, even adding soy sauce couldn't save the dish. Honestly, even fast food Asian restaurants taste better than the dishes they serve here.I wouldn't recommend coming to this place, go somewhere else and don't waste your money here.The only good thing about this place was the server being nice but that's about it.
4485;I am going to throw out a disclaimer-- I have never had Nepalese or Himalayan food so take it for what it's worth.Every time we drove by we always wanted to make a stop at this place but it so happens we are always on route to some other destination. On this night, we weren't going to drive by anymore.This place was empty except for 2 other guests. As we walked in, we were presented with a strange aroma of some sort. After several minutes I was finally able to decipher the smell and it's one of cooked bamboo. I remember growing up when mom used to put bamboo in our soups sometimes and the whole house had this strange, repulsive smell. It took a bit of time to adjust but after while, we were somewhat immune to it.I had some vegetable thali platter of a few veggies and some rice and my partner had of all things a butter chicken (I think she was a little weary and wanted to play it safe). My platter consisted of some potatoes which was very bland. There was also some pungent smelling bamboo shoots that aga
4486;Fries were good. Bought a Po'boy (seafood) which I found disgusting. Too much sauce not enough seafood. Super expensive ($15) for a sandwich and fries.  Will never return.
4487;If you like bread toasted almost to the point of being burnt AND so soggy the sandwich doesn't hold its shape, this is the place for you.  They put a lot of meat in their sandwiches, but not much else.  And the meat is dry.  I ended up taking the sandwich apart and feeding the meat to a cat.
4488;Weekp, they say they're open at 7am and I walked over at 7:15 prepared for amazingness. They were closed and the lady inside told me come back in 5-10. It's 8am now and they're still not opened so I went to Starbucks. Bummed but so hungry I just can't wait any longer.
4489;Awful! and the flies were nonstop!  If I could leave this place a negative star I would!   I came to this placed based on the yelp reviews...I should have known it was the worst when the cab driver asked why are you coming to this restaurant when their are so many other places in downtown Toronto.
4490;// I don't understand all the good reviews this place is getting.  My partner and I were there today.  The food took 30 minutes to get to our table, our server was seemingly uninterested in us after she took our order, and while the burger I had was okay, the wilted salad I had with it was only matched by the awful hash browns my husband received with his breakfast.The place was not super busy, but even if it had been, that's no excuse for poor food and poor service.  We will not be back.
4491;Fantastic place if you feel like being blatantly ignored for 35 minutes, have to beg to order coffee and inevitably have to walk out. Cheers to Sunday brunch.
4492;Walked and waitress said it would be a few mins for a larger booth for our group (2 kids 3 adults). Waited. Another group came in and took the booth and the waitress didn't say anything. We stood at the bar waiting and decided to sit near the bar. The lady behind the bar was rude to us saying that we couldn't there. Needless to say we went else where.
4493;So my boyfriend and I went to frankies hoping for a normal lunch...but once we walked in no one showed us to a table and the waitress just stared at us and ignored us. So I just led myslef to a table as I am a regular so I didn't think it'd matter since she didn't have the courtesy to show us to a table (there was a table free and clean and no one else came before us). I didn't mind about how she didn't show us to a table...but it took her 40 minutes to get us our food and when we asked she said she didn't know when it's be done and she did not bother to check or assure us she'd check with the kitchen. I've been going to frankies since I was in high school I have never had this kind of service even when it was super packed or busy the server would always come up to me right away to either take me to a table or assure me she'll come help me in a bit....
4494;I really don't like this waitress there. This blonde short one skinny one always has her hair in a bun anyways, I don't remember her name but she's very stuck up, snarky, and doesn't know how to serve properly. This is the second time i've had her. The first time was my friend, and my boyfriend and I were outside and it was 10:00. We waited for so long for her. FIRST OFF! When you get a customer in the serving business YOU are suppose to bring them water, check up on them to see how long they need with the menu. INSTEAD i took it upon myself to be rude and return the menus back and told her we are LEAVING! and told her she was the WORST waitress I've ever had. Last night was my 2nd time. She was so rude and ask if we are taking things out, NO we aren't we are coming in for Fondue! FINALLY she actually did a good thing was to bring us water, and our food but seriously i don't like her attitude and the way she talks she seems very FAKE!!! legit she's lucky she got a tip last night... Or did something "nice" or 
4495;I am surprised by the good rating. I am not a picky eater or chocolate connoisseur, but their chocolate does not taste any better or different than in an ordinary coffee shop or another brunch spot. Mostly though I was shocked by their high prices and super small serving sizes (I am not someone who eats big portions). Maybe my expectations were too high, but I won't be back and can't recommend this place. Too bad, I was hoping for a nice chocolate experience.
4496;Service is okay but the food is not so good. Crepe is definitely not worth it for any price. the sandwiches are okay......
4497;Got the frozen chocolate here to go. Lacks richness/flavour. Huge chucks of ice instead of smaller ones. Did not blend enough. After a few sips, it was basically a cup of ice
4498;Should hire more people since it's crazy busy during the Christmas market. Servers were overwhelmed and not very helpful. The wait is ridiculous. People who came in after us were also served before us.
4499;Ordered the vintage hot chocolate and a latte, almost 30 minutes later we get two cold drinks. We asked them to warm it up but the server was a bit rude. Shit service but they may have been short staffed. Would not recommend unless you have over an hour to kill to get a drink.
4500;Used the Groupon for the Tasting Menu tonight and have to say I was very disappointed with the event. To start off the host is incredibly full of himself, overly brisk, with the feeling that you should understand you are lucky to be in his restaurant. The tasting menu is definitely a tasting menu, a small taste of a few things. The rooms are lovely, the design excellent, the service staff very efficient. A very large investment has been made in far out dishware, too bad the same can't be said for the food. The serving plates were piping hot, sadly not hot enough to heat up the food. The cheese course was a joke, reminiscent of those cardboard circular cheese boxes with a dozen triangles of tasteless cheese, along with two tiny smears of soemthing that may have tasted good if there was enough to taste. The lobster bisque tasted oddly sour for some reason. The main: Tyle Fish could have come from Captain Highliner, the sauce was so incredibly spicy there was no tasting of the fish. Lukewarm mashed potatoes (the
4501;I'm sorry to hear about your other restaurant closing, I had an opportunity to try your restaurant and I did find it difficult to understand your staff, the bald man not wearing an apron was very pleasant but he seemed to be a little slow, the dish I had was extremely salty.  The wine choice was very pricey, I saw one wine I recognized on the menu for $60 and I saw it in the liquor store for $8.95.  I wish restaurants would operate with integrity and appreciate their customers and not try to rob them while dining out. I give this restaurant 1 out of 5 for blatantly trying to rob from their so called guests.  Shame on you Chiado.I wish you luck but I predict a downward shift in business and I predict by March you will have reached your lowest point in business and might need to resort to another low point of groupon or coupon cutting.
4502;Overpriced peasant food, bairrada down the street offers the same food at 1/3 the price and similar service. The space beside chiado is always empty, is it open for business, I heard they were not, can anybody tell me if they still accept groupon?
4503;The Yelp page for Chiado claims that the restaurant is wheelchair accessible which it is laughably not. Do not come to this establishment if you have accessibility needs.
4504;Food and atmosphere were good but terrible service. Definitely not what you'd expect at this kind of establishment, and quite disappointing.
4505;I had chilli chicken and norling fried noodles both were bland and didn't taste good the service was good but the food was really bland. The chicken pakora literally tasted like a chicken cracker and super dry. I would not be visiting this restaurant ever again
4506;Food: pretty damned goodoverall experience: lousy. Slow service is forgivable. Rude service is not.We were seated fairly quickly but we had to wait quite a while to get menus and water (after asking the wait staff several times). When the waiter came to take our order he mumbled something about appetizers and when my sister started ordering her main course he interrupted her by loudly saying "I asked for appetizers". The food came at a decent time but once they were on the table we were ignored and couldn't even order drinks. we just stuck with what little water we had until the end of the meal. When it came time to pay we had to wait at least 10 minutes to get our bill. We probably would have waited even longer waiting for the credit card machine but I got fed up and just went to the bar to pay.Everyone else there seemed to be enjoying their experience so I'm not sure if we just got the pissed off waiters or what.Also who charges for papadums?The food was actually pretty good but a bit on the price
4507;I was there a few months ago with my family. As we started eating, noticed a cockroach with it's egg crawling by the table wall. Immediately lost appetite and left the place. That was the last time will ever go.
4508;It's a take out restaurant, my husband and I just wanted to grab some express food and go. We lined up and waited to order. The server asked everyone about their order in the line except us (the server just ignored us!). During this time, someone in the line already grabbed their pre-cooked food. We walked all the way from the entrance to the casher, and ordered a veggie roti and a noodle. The guy confirmed the order with us and went back to the kitchen. Within 15 mins, there were 3 cashers came to us and double checked our order, and went to the kitchen again. After 20 mins of waiting, one female chaser were still asking what our order is!! One of the male cashers expained that because we are not the usually customer, we kinda did not know how to order...SO, GUYS, IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE, THEN DON'T, CAUSE THEY DO NOT TAKR THE FIRST TIMER'S ORDER!I gave 1 star for we finally left with one of the items.
4509;Everything is SOOOOOOOO Salty! They charge TAX on food....like what the hell.....I'd rather go somewhere else...
4510;This place is a total waste!! I had went here couple of times to buy string hoppers and after waiting for 20 minutes in line, was told they ran out. Once when I bought a chicken kothu Roti,  it tasted like fish! I am allergic to fish! It was disgusting. It also had a dead cockaroache in the middle! Why would people even go to this place! It's total junk!
4511;$100 meal at a fine dining STEAK HOUSE and can't get the steak right?Came here with my buddies on Friday night.  This meal was hyped up for us - and was definitely looking forward to the steak all day.Not much of a beer selection, 2 IPA's with one of them tapped dry at 8:30pm.  Not the greatest beers either but did its job.  Later switched to an overpriced Italian Merlot - definitely not worth the price tag but good enough to be paired with a steak.Started off with a caesar salad which was... well just a carsar salad.  This wasn't the main event anyway so how good or bad the caesar salad is, was the last thing on my mind.The main event was the rib steak 16oz, which apparently per our waiter was their claim to fame.  Ordered it medium just the way I like it.  Where this dining experience lost its stars was the fact it came to me very much on the rare side.  Fine dining restaurant and can't even get a medium right?  Come on guys!  When bringing it up to the waiter, he immediately responded "we can thr
4512;#sucks: Steak was undercooked, had to return it and I never do that! they ran out of beer. I had no access to my pellegrino until I asked him, guess he thought it was expensive wine. ..never again! Hy's is the way to go!
4513;We came for my husbands birthday and we will NEVER return again way too much hype on a place that's outdated and needs to be revamped in a big bad way! The service we were hoping would make up for it, well that was the worst part, our waiter sucked large. The bus boys were awesome and the coat check lady was very nice, but man the waiter was rotten!The tomato and onion salad was presented in a way that resembled a local diner the lettuce was wilted and I had to add copious amounts of salt and pepper to make it taste decent, when I asked for the oil on the side the waiter snubbed me....seriously the service was beyond below average it was actually stupidly horrendous! The filet mignon was meh with two count them two stalks of broccoli wow is that what I get for $400.00 plus!!!??? Then the waiter took the oil and vinegar away very nice touch there buddy!! The wines way over priced and the desserts, well can we say hello 1970's. People save your money and go to the Keg, they actually have better service, b
4514;Not being a Torontonian, I had done a lot of research for a steakhouse for my boyfriend (BF)'s birthday. Reviews for Barbarians seemed good so I made a reservation for 8:30 on a Friday 3 weeks in advance. We showed up at exactly 8:30 with about 3 other couples arriving within 2 minutes of us. We were all told there was about a five minute wait and they gave us some bubbly wine to compensate. BF and I thought that was a nice touch since 5 minutes was not a long wait. 30 minutes later, one pair of couples were seated while the line up at the door continued to grow and we were anxiously, hungrily waiting for our table. The other two waiting couples were seated before us and then around 9:10 we were finally brought to our table by the manager who said "I will take care of you to ensure a special evening". We were brought to the worst table in the whole restaurant right in front of the kitchen where you can see and hear everything. We saw another table being cleared and asked to move. The waiter gave us attitude b
4515;Get stomache right after the steak and french soup. I also asked the hot water which tasted so weired. Will Never return. Disappointed!!!!!
4516;In one word.... HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!! I started out with escargot and accidently touched the plate it was in a burnt my finger!!! It was extremely hot and no one warned us that it was so hot and I spent the rest of dinner with a glass of ice cubes that the waiter had to bring to us. I ordered a rib eye steak and after taking my first bite of the steak I suspected it was rancid. I was with a group of ten people and we were all having fun and they all looked like they were enjoying their meals so I hated mentioning it.  I passed my plate around the table and everyone did a sniff test and told me that I had just probably ordered my steak too rare and they thought it was fine. Our waiter was very nice and I didn't want to upset the fun time we were all having so I just left my steak and asked for it to be put in a goody bag although by this point I was turned off my dinner!!!! My finger was throbbing and I had had nothing to eat!!! We all sat and had fun and I went home and within an hour of getting home I beca
4517;It was the most horrible birthday dinner experience in my life. 1. FOOD POISONING - My friend was terribly ill in the next morning, doctor diagnosed him that he got a stomach flu. I feel bad for him seeing him lying on bad for FOUR days. 2. RESTAURANT MANAGER CALLED BACK WITH HORRIBLE ATTITUDE. Four days later, I wrote an email on behalf of my very ill friend about this situation. The manager called back and told me I am false accusing them and denying the fault right away and started to yell at me that I can not speak on behalf of my friend and it must be his own fault eating something else that causes this food poisoning. I went straight ahead to file a formal complain with the city of Toronto regarding this incident.3. OVERCOOKED STEAK- Both of us ordered medium-rare steak that night, but mine came in "Well done" and the quality of the steak was simply not impressing considering each steak cost over $50. Maybe I need to thank God that I escaped from food poisoning. Unfortunately, my friend was the lu
4518;Great atmosphere, very comfortable, unique, good service...etc.  I truly thought I was in for a 5 star experience.  I had heard that the bone-in ribeye was the "go to" steak and was recommended by the waiter, so most in our party of 14 ordered it.  The appetizers were great, good drinks, quality service, then came the ribeyes....I ordered my ribeye between medium and medium rare and it came out fully rare (seared on the outside, cold in the middle).  Everyone who ordered the ribeye had the same experience.  The cut of meat was very poor.  I only finished a third of it as the ribeye was extremely tough, full of difficult to chew tendons/fat etc.  I've honestly had better steaks at Appleby's!  This was very surprising since Barberians came so highly recommended.  The bad cut and low quality of ribeye combined with the chef's unwillingness to comply with our temperature requests is enough for me to give only 1 star, as the primary reason for us coming here was for the steak!
4519;Despite reading good reviews online, this is one of the worst restaurants I have ever eaten at in my entire life. DO NOT EAT HERE. When we first walked in there was a distinct musty smell. We had just arrived from Nordstrom with fresh full cups of iced coffee and they proceeded to demand that we were not allowed to keep our drinks. For an appetizer I ordered the French onion soup because of another review declaring it as "the best soup ever." However, when I dug my spoon into the cheese, I quickly realized it was spoiled as creamy curdled cheese oozed from it. Our waiter and the manager were both extremely rude. The manager never even came over to apologize for the incident. Afterwards I felt ill so I went to use the bathroom and it was filthy with flies everywhere. When our waiter initially took our order he asked my mom how she wanted her steak cooked. She said "either medium or medium well." To which he responded that he could not do either as it is previously prepared rare by the chef. He suggested that h
4520;The ceaser salad was sour. The rib steaks were burned. Basically paid 42 for soup in the end. Never going back. Waiter was rude and unaccomadating when we complained saying that's just how we do things here. Poor busboy was nice.  Sad he works there and not somewhere else
4521;Very rude staff that answer the phone for reservations. Had a birthday for over 11 and was told I would get a call back since it was considered an event. That was ok by me. Almost a week passed and nothing. I called back and told them that I was expecting s call from them to make a large reservation and he guy was very rude to me. He didn't apologize that they didn't call back. He then asked me how many people and for what time. I told him and he said I'll see you then and hung up. Not polite at all for a high scale restaurant.  Felt more of cocky attitude as if my business didn't matter and the restaurant would fill up anyways. Good thing their steak is good. Even though it comes at a price.
4522;The NY striploin was tasteless and was not made to order. I asked for medium well and got rare instead. Fries were soggy. Will not be taking friends here again. Will be trying Ruth's Chris steakhouse instead.
4523;Where trendy trumps quality. I don't get the good reviews or line-ups for this place. I've frequent this place a few times simply because it is right around the corner from my home and I like eggs Benedict. While it started to become a regular spot for me and my friends, it wasn't because it was good. It was because it was convenient. Today, I made the final decision, no more.  Primarily because of the poor service, poor attitude and no flexibility.  I wanted to order the Eggs Benny with avocado, and brie cheese but wanted to substitute the brie for cheddar. This seemed to be just too much for them to handle. Because of the substitution, my order would have to be classed as a "build your own" at a highly inflated price. I understand no substations sometimes, but brie for cheddar isn't rocket science and they did have cheddar on the menu and the attitude that followed just turned me right off. So many establishments want my business, why settle for one that simply doesn't care. I cancelled my order and left, a
4524;Been there a few times and don't really understand and after the last time I don't really care to understand. Living in the neighbourhood I see and wonder as friends say what a great place this is to meet and have brunch.The food... Hard dry bread fit only to be a trencher at some place like Medieval Times...  poached eggs or is there another choice???... over spiced potatoes... grim avocados should have been tossed days ago.Decor of recovered trailer trash from the last hurricane... Grungy plywood floors... no real accommodation made for any kind of client comfort... The concept is dated and in the wrong area of the country to be meaningful. I simply do not find sitting in a broken down discarded old chair not being able to touch anything more real that particle board an experience worth seeking and or paying money for.Staff of tweekers and dizzy blonds... I have eaten here four times only because I had to... the orders are never correct and there is never anything but a vacuous glazed wondering... Th
4525;Every time I call to order food for pick up they say they are busy. I know on there website it says "Take OutWe will accept take out orders when we are able. Serving the customers in the restaurant is our priority. If we have a line-up we will not accept a take-out order. No take out orders on weekends. Thank you for your understanding."You might as well take it off your website as you seem to be always busy. Which is great. But how come you cant make a sandwich for take out. is it that hard to do that?I guess the kitchen cant handle it. How long dose it take to make a sandwich, i bet people sit in the restaurant longer then it takes to make. The restaurant is so small that they should be able to handle it. I would be walking to the restaurant to pick up, so regardless I would be in the restaurant. whats one more sandwich to make.? Its not that hard to make.I guess they don't need to make money.
4526;Food looked great, wish we had the opportunity to actually eat. Restaurant closed at 3, we called in to check before heading there. They confirmed and we said "ok heading in now". Got there by 2:30, there was a line, so we waited outside in the cold for 10 mins before we actually stepped in (b/c the line was to the door). Got in, waited another 10-15 only to be told that we couldn't be seated b/c they didn't foresee another table becoming available before 3. Mind you we were the last people in line, with only a party of 2. It seemed absolutely ridiculous that they couldn't accommodate us. Especially after I mentioned that we called before coming. At the end of the day it was a wasted $16 uber ride only to get turned away and spend more money on an uber to find another restaurant. So word to the wise, don't bother coming that last hour they're "opened". As you can see from other reviews there's always a line, and getting in line by a certain means nothing to them.
4527;Really loud noisy place. The lunch menu is NOT good and the servers don't care whether or not you like your food. I ordered the chicken sandwich, ate one bite, told the manager it was not good, the chicken tasted bad and the mayo was too much and gross. She didn't do anything and did not care less. I ALWAYS tip no matter how bad the service was but in this case I did not as I paid $20 for a meal I ate one bite of. Waste of money.
4528;Rude waitress. The most bland huevos rancheros, that looked like prison food. "Very spicy" hot sauce was as mild as ketchup, and could not save our tasteless meal. Cash only. Really don't get the hype.
4529;Went here on a Saturday afternoon with my girlfriend after being recommended by a friend. We arrived at 2:40 knowing that they close at 3 and that the place was in-demand. Although there were two parties in front of us waiting to be seated, we were told that we 'may or may not' be seated before the kitchen closes at 3 but that we would be given some indication within the next 5 to 10 minutes. So we decided to stay until they told us it wasn't happening. Over the next 20 minutes, the two parties in front of us ended up being seated and the hostess returned to us three times letting us know that she's pushing tables along. Not once was it said that we probably wouldn't get a seat and that we should leave.Meanwhile, two parties after us were turned away being told they wouldn't be seated. At 3pm, there were three tables paying for their meals yet we were told, at that very moment, that the kitchen had closed and that we wouldn't get a seat. I have never written a review on Yelp before but this experien
4530;I live in the neighborhood and tried this place when it first opened and was pretty excited.  Its not the same as it was. I went this past weekend, see there wasn't a large line outside but there was a little one inside.  I was pretty disappointed after speaking with the host.  I'd asked how long it would take to get a seat for two and wasn't given a number, i got a shrug.  I then asked for more information, like how far down the line I was etc.  And she responded with, "Don't tell me how to do my job".  Maybe she felt offended that I asked questions but I don't believe warranted that response.i left and went over to lil baci - no lines and awesome serviceI will not go back
4531;I've been here a few times and although it always has a line up it's really not worth it. Gave it a few chances to see if perhaps it was just an "off" day for their staff but three times is enough to draw a line and it simply isn't worth it. 1) The staff seem less than happy to be there- they're harried, impatient with questions, and dismissive. The third time I was there, we sat for 10 minutes waiting to get their attention just to get a menu. 2) I have an allergy and got extremely ill the third time I was there due to a contamination- the server didn't seem to care or actually look in to whether the kitchen could make a dish modification. My guess is they weren't able to. 3) There are so many other good restaurants in the area that it really isn't worth waiting an hour in any sort of weather for overpriced eggs and bacon. I want to love it because it's local to me but I really can't be bothered to give it another shot.
4532;Bad experience.I do love this place in some ways but their cash only, holier then thou attitude, poorly handled line ups and borderline lazy staff has turned me off of the place.Most recently I went for a midweek lunch yesterday and the staff seemed genuinely disinterested in serving people quickly and seating new people as tables cleared.We were late for our next stop by the time we were seated we asked just for a quick bowl of soup. The waitress would not get it out of the pot for us and insisted we'd have to wait for the 4 orders in front of us, all fully cooked meals. Why when we were in a rush she couldn't quickly pour two bowls of soup can only be described as not giving a crap about us. Zero effort unfortunately, hence zero stars. This is ruining an otherwise nice experience that used to be lady marmalade.If you're going to have a restaurant pretend at least to care and show some effort if your customers are in a rush.
4533;Food 5 stars - I enjoyed the Moroccan scrambled eggs. Service 1 star. Waitress not friendly and tried to rush us to leave. She asked me if I wanted my drink packed to go. I've never had that happen. Atmosphere 1 star. There's a crowd of people standing near the tables staring at you while you eat. And it's cold because the door is left open a lot and there isn't a good barrier. Also they do not take anything other than cash. Overall I felt a pretentious vibe from the staff. Would not return despite the good food. For a great experience, I'd recommend smith, Fresh or the Senator instead.
4534;We really wanted to try this restaurant for the fact that it uses sustainably sourced ingredients. Our 3rd attempt to visit this place which ended up being the poorest customer service we've ever experienced!!! It's understandable that the kitchen closes at a specific time, but when you have guests waiting in line to be sat, (and in our case waited nearly 15 minutes) and you tell them they can't be served because the kitchen closes soon and you don't allow customers to order in line...that is the epitome of poor customer service and lack of care and concern for your patrons period! It would have been acceptable if we were told upon entering the establishment, but to let us wait nearly 15 minutes...especially with a child...and refuse us service??? You never, ever, under any circumstance turn away customers who have been waiting due to your lack of diligence. And from what I was told it's the restaurants policy to turn guests away!!! It's appalling and is clear that management doesn't value their customers. Do
4535;We visited LM on a Monday morning because (the far, far superior in every way) Bonjour Brioche sadly wasn't open. After waiting in line for about 30 minutes, we were seated by a server who seemed pretty disinterested in us. We both ordered the "crepe croque monsieur" which was almost inedible. The cream sauce tasted like hot lemon ice cream poured over ham. The potatoes tasted like they were day-old - dry and flavourless. I left half my meal on the plate, which I never, ever, ever do. I would go as far to say it one of the worst dishes I've had in a restaurant  - I couldn't get the sweet lemony taste out of my mouth for days. Just because a restaurant is in Leslieville, does not automatically mean it's good (despite being trendy to think so).
4536;The food here is decent, but I would skip it for the plethora of other great brunch places in Toronto if you're looking for anything above subpar service and polite waitstaff.
4537;They will not take reservations so long waits in Long lineups, I met friends there so I waited in line for about 40 minutes only to be disappointed by a noisy, overpriced restaurant with slow service.  Had some soggy, oversweet, French toast. I would not do this again for sure.
4538;I absolutely LOVE this place and have been attending for years, introducing my friends and family from out of town, always showing my love, appreciation, and support. I've loved how accommodating, enthusiastic, and homey this place is, as are their employees. However, this morning was a curveball I would've never expected.I just had possibly the worst interaction I've ever had over the phone with one of their staff members in regards to a potential visit. I would never speak to someone like that, nor would I ever dismiss a potential customers' questions or visits. This person was very cold over the phone, did not answer my questions, and hung up on me. How completely rude and uncalled for. Is this how they treat their clientele? Am I just blind to it because the food is so delicious?Regardless of such deliciousness, I really don't think I'll be bringing myself to this place any time soon, nor introducing anyone again if such attitude persists. Thanks, but no thanks!
4539;Disappointing.Pretty hungry, my choice for dinner was Saigon Lotus based on reviews and photos. So, why is it a one-star for me?1. Hygiene - I sat at a table that was all sticky and the menu was actually almost glued to it.2. Service - More like fast food, pretty quick, but I had to go get my own napkins and chopsticks or cutlery.3. Menu - a lot of options on both vegetarian and non-vegetarian.4. Price - good portions for value5. My order - what gave it a 1 - Contemplating between a combo of small dishes or one main meal, I went for the latter, which was combo 35, pan fried rice noodles with a mix of fresh vegetables and sauce. Excited to try a new Vietnamese hot dish, this is what I got: a warm plate of sticky noodles, topped with mere samples of almost raw vegetables, soaked in a watery sauce that splattered all over my face and shirt.- vegetables were barely cooked or stir fried- vegetable quantities were very small, such as mushrooms, a few slices that might not combine to one whole.- Sauce: co
4540;Restaurant only offering vegan or vegetarian options, which is fine.  However, pictures of beef pho is still shown on the website.  Wasted 45 mins going downtown with friends who eat meat.
4541;Just got the pressed beef here for take out. I had it dine in last week and pieces of beef were thick and medium rare perfect. Today I got take out and the pieces were PAPER THIN for over 13.99 what a joke pure rice. NEVER coming back here again and you guys shouldn't either.
4542;Cute space, and it's great to support a small local shop. However, the coffee they poured me was horrifying. It had clearly been sitting on the burner for far too long. Will never order coffee there again. Blech.
4543;I live in the neighbourhood and really want to like this place.  We've been there twice and experienced very poor customer service both times.  The food is good but not good enough to make up for the lack of customer service.The first time we went the person at the cash told me "it was a pain" for her to make change from my $20.The second time we went I was served the blackest, most burned quiche I've ever seen and told by the waitress that they knew it was burned but wanted to see if I would eat it anyways.  Seriously, that is so rude and almost mind numbingly bad service.I was given a $10 coupon to make up for the quiche which I spent right away on cookies because I won't be going back.
4544;Disappointing coffee and service ever!!It was super busy saturday afternoon.I lined up and waited 5min and order my coffee extra ice and long shot as usual.But even 10min later my iced coffee didnt ready so I asked the lady ...my iced latte coming. She looked forgot my order. But she didnt say sorry and told me it will be ready after another customer's drink. But I knew that the another customer was lined up way behind of me so it was very annoying and disappointing.Anyways she made my coffee in a very sloppy way.. And she almost threw the lid of cup and went away.I am regulr here almost 1 year butNever seen this rude before so embarassed.But it was okay cause it was busy and people can make a mistake I do understand that but the problem was coffee taste....It was disappointing.No extra ice or no longshot.It was almost milk color.I used to recommend people this place butI am not sure from now.They are always super busy most weekend lunch time So dont expect good service or coffee.So
4545;TL:DR - Had to wait for table even with reservation made days before and was told to move tables AFTER we had started eating. Food and service were not good they seemed unorganized. Will not be coming back. Save your money to go somewhere nicer.______I am quite surprised by the many great reviews of this place because I experienced quite the opposite in terms what others have said regarding the service and food. The experience my mom and I had left us sour and we have already alerted all our friends and family not to come here due to the bad service and food. My mom had gone here recently for crepes on a weekday with friends and had found the quite place charming and unique. That being said, during her time there, she saw many people having afternoon tea and wanted to try it herself.During our visit, my mom and I had made reservations to try their afternoon tea set on a Saturday (she called the shop the previous Tuesday to reserve). She had told me after our meal that no one had picked up the phone w
4546;This establishment was a huge disappointment. When you go for high tea, you expect the place to be charming in some way, and to have some decent level of service.. at the very least. The place itself is a tiny room.. empty on a Sunday afternoon. It was actually very underwhelming. But the terrible service is the reason why I will never come back again. We selected "afternoon tea" on the menu but was told that we booked "high tea" on the phone. High tea was $38 (vs $28 for afternoon tea) and only difference was a quiche and some greens. I've been to high tea a couple of times elsewhere, including at Windsor Arms and Shang Gri La, and when you reserve for "high tea", there is only ONE meaning and ONE price to it. First of all, nobody explained that two options even existed when I reserved on the phone. Secondly, a couple of us don't even like quiches. Why would we pay $10 extra for something we don't want? When I explained this to the server, she informed us that no changes were allowed because "the quiches
4547;I went with my baby and family on Thursday and the food wasn't bad but omg the service. We finished eating breakfast and the waitress gave us our bill without asking. We asked for a second refill of coffee 4 times to 3 different waiters! To top it off my 6 month old daughter spilled a glass of water on the table and on the seat, the server saw and left a cloth on the table to clean it up ... seriously, rude.  We felt like we were being rushed and weren't being served anymore so we decided to leave. While at the front desk I noticed I didn't transfer enough money on my debit card to leave the tip on it but I had cash in my bag, so I was going to leave it on the table. Then the waitress starts saying rude sarcastic remarks and giving me the stink eye for not leaving her a tip. Like seriously, first of all we haven't left yet, second of all you don't know what I'm doing, and third of all you shouldn't even expect a tip. I ended up giving her $10 for a $40 meal to shut her up. I was so upset, she completely ruine
4548;Don't get here often, first time was great! Ordered  glass noodle salads, soups, another glass noodle dish  to go since I was having people over. Staff even separated the shrimps due to an allergy. Next visit, repeat the glass noodle salads, YUK!!! It was wrong,clumpy, too hot heat wise. Called to discuss the experience, person didn 't care much. Asked over  the phone for a manger, no straight answer, or not avaiable. Regret refering people. Party trays, only the manager can quote, not around  so never ordered. Service matters, i wanted 0 stars.Lots of good options elsewhere...
4549;Cannot say how this food tastes. We waited 2 hours for our delivery and it never showed up. Called several times to a very rude employee. Won't go back.
4550;They welcomed me by telling me the kitchen was closing and its last call. We had 35 minutes. Not welcoming, we are going in to enjoy food and socialize. All they care about is $$$. Customer leaves when they wish....
4551;Food and service has gone majorly downhill since ownership switched over. Nothing special here and they really need to clean their espresso machine. Rufino should be fantastic, but you can taste that the machine is dirty and the new staff keep giving me lactose milk when I ask for lactose free or soy.
4552;Last week we decided to start our regular summer visits for gelato.  It was clear that there was a change in ownership with the place operating to CARNIE standards:* Pay first for gelato and receive a dirty ticket (cashier handed me one off the floor).* When not collecting cash the cashier just stood by watching her staff members try to service a lineup of customers holding tickets (my mistake, working on cashier must be filler between her full time job as smoker).* The girl scooping my gelato got some on her fingers and decided clean it off by scraping it into my scoop...YuuuK!* In midway of plating, the cook left hot food sitting bare on the counter while he stepped out for a smoke with the cashier.* Oreo gelato was no longer the same...it was short on feature ingredient.There really is no reason to return.Message to owner:" TRAIN YOUR STAFF TO HAVE FOOD SERVICE DECORUM "
4553;This place is around the corner from my office - but my colleagues and I have officially decided to "break up" with it after many years of patronage. The food is excellent - no complaints there. It's the staff. They are outrageously rude. They are impatient, condescending, unattentive and look at you with dagger eyes when you order. I've really never encountered anything like it before. We used to use them for office lunches all the time, but our office admin refuses to go there anymore because of the attitude. It's unfortunate - great food but they are losing business because of the two miserable female servers. The manager/owner seems terrific. What a shame!
4554;Awesome gelato and espresso. Worst customer service ever! After spending $30 on gelato last night we got kicked out with attitude at 10 pm not allowing us to finish our ice cream! Need lessons in class and courtesy.
4555;Very disappointing, I'm still irritated.I paid $8 for a small mocha with the banana purée they offer which sounded greatI got it half sweet, also asked for double shot of espresso I ordered with the barista The drink came and although it had a pretty heart on it and I really was shocked that I tasted no coffee, no essence of espresso, just basically a hot chocolate The cashier was someone different nowwhen I politely mentioned the mistake and asked if maybe they forgot to put in the espresso (which happens a lot -- I worked at Starbucks )they kind of ignored me and tried to tell me you can't taste it with the banana which is nuts because I'm an an avid coffee drinker of all types and i know a small latte based beverage with a double shot coffee should be tasted.I told him I had it half sweet so I knew it wasn't the sweetness hiding the coffee then he said you couldn't get it half sweet which I laughed that he would say such a weird thing, simply less chocolate seems obvious The barista didn't get invo
4556;All for supporting local business but this place's quality and pricing make it way harder. Why does a espresso with ice cost more than a ice latte at Jimmy's? Rather support "Livelihood" (in the spot of what was casa coffee) or Jimmy's, there's a couple shops up on College. Honestly anywhere is better than here.... even Tim Hortons.
4557;Although my first experience here was bad enough to warrant a two star review, my wife sent me back as she's a fan of their organic whole chickens. My past two visits have proven to me that this store actually needs to be downgraded to one star in my opinion.These people are masters of wasting my time. My second visit here had me stand at the meat counter along with two other patient customers as they happily conducted a photo shoot of their meat behind the counter. The food stylist and the photographer addressed us and went to the back to get someone to help us. The owner guy once again came out to "help". He was in a nice suit so he too had to then go to the back as we waited patiently for a third person to come out to help us. I think their photo shoot could have been scheduled on any other day rather than on a busy Saturday morning.Last visit... (ever)... I waited at the meat counter for a couple minutes before, you guessed it, the same guy came out to "help" me. I asked if he had any whole chickens. 
4558;We came because someone recommended the food to us. While the wings were really good, I couldn't enjoy my meal because this place is such a dump. It was filthy and cramped with boxes of frozen fries piled up on the floor. The walls and ceiling had what looked like years worth of grease on them. Everything needs a serious scrubbing and a fresh coat of paint. If they're too lazy to keep the area that customers order and eat in clean then you have to ask yourself what the areas we don't get to see are like. There are better BBQ places in the area where you won't get grossed out.
4559;I ordered food an hour in advance for pick up. When I arrived, I still had to wait another 45 minutes for my food, and they still didn't get it right.I ordered the Elvis platter, which was not that good. They forgot to include the cornbread. The ribs were dry, and the creamy parmesan chicken wings were partially sauced and weren't impressive at all. The best part was the pulled pork, which was pretty bland compared to R&D's in Brampton. I would not go here again, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Try R&D's instead.
4560;Horrible horrible service. Me and my family normally order from them on weekends (we live down the street, and walk over).In error, we placed an order at the other location. The horribly run franchises refused to make the order at the correct location (after we admitted our mistake and apologizing for the inconvenience), and they would not take an order from us. After YEARS of being customers to them, they refuse to take our order after a simple one time mistake. I urge everyone reading this to find another pizza place that actually cares about the way they treat people.
4561;Wow! this was a shocker because one my friend recommend this place, so of course I showed up to try their jerk chicken, it was really bad like wow bad! on top of everything the owners are actually Jamaican, how can they make such horrible jerk chicken I have no IdeaThe pros, good customer service, good value, and tons of parking (same plaza as the Timmies )
4562;Who has reviewed this place in the past. Let me start by saying the person taking the orders takes longer taking your order then the person putting your food together. I ordered a large oxtail with Rice.  To eat in .The rice was left over reheated rice it was in clumps dry not tasty . Oxtail not much flavor plain.They did have hot sauce on the table but the bottle was nasty dusty  so I did not touch it.The only good thing about my lunch was the drink was cold.People make your way to Hwy 10 for good food
4563;UPDATE: it's been a little while since I mademy first visit here and nothing has changed...place is dirty, I won't be eating here again.After reading the review on BlogTO and knowing that  there aren't many breakfast/brunch spots in the area I figured I would give this place a try...I walked in on a Sunday morning and was greeted with an unpleasant smell. I can't really pinpoint it, it was just unpleasant. The restaurant is small and cosy. It's well decorated and there is a large window up front that lets in a great deal of natural light. A girl was at the back of the kitchen and told me she would be with me in a moment. As I looked around the kitchen area I saw that the cooking areas appeared clean, but were actually quite dirty. The floor looks like it hasn't been washed in a little while, the appliances weren't the cleanest either. At this point I realized that odor was likely coming from the kitchen. I ordered a tea (English breakfast) sat on the patio, had my tea and left. I will return in a month or 
4564;If I could give 0 stars I would. You pay a bunch of money for crap. I ordered French toast, chicken hash, beef sandwich, and a kale mango smoothie. The beef sandwich was decent but everything else was a complete ripoff. The French toast barely had any egg, the chicken hash contained 1 single tiny piece of chicken. I was really looking forward to the kale mango smoothie but it tasted like it was made with mango flavoured powder with a tiny bit of kale thrown in. I drink a lot of real fruit juice (mango is my favourite) so I can definitely tell the difference.
4565;Waste of time and money ...save yourself the money and buy a ton of corn beef and some tacos and make your own. Slow service and small portions
4566;Hungry going in, hungry going out.Service: 0/5We were sited promptly at arrival, upon ordering, we were told that smoke meat and reuben sandwich was not available for ordering. So going to a smoke meat place without smoke meat is like going to wings place without wings. Why brother even open for business if your main item is not available?We placed our order, meat sampler dinner for two, which was supposed to be a taster of the best item offered by the restaurant. The description of the dish was 4 wings, 4 rib, 4 oz of smoke meat and 4 oz of pull pork, served with rye bread.What we were served almost 45 minutes later is: 8 piece of wings, 4 piece of ribs, 4 oz of pull pork, and some loaf breads.We were never notify of the substitution or let us know there was a delay, and was sitting there hungry awaits for our food while other tables are being served.The waitress avoid eye contact with us after putting down the dish and never asked how the food was.Food: 0/5Let's start with wings, when we bit
4567;Our smoked meat sandwiches came with an incredibly small serving of meat that managed to be mostly fat. The service was quick and the fries were good. When we told our server about the food she said"sorry" and that was that.Mostly a complete waste of more than $30 for two sad sandwiches
4568;We had ventured to this location many times because the food is delicious, unfortunately I will not be going back again due to the customer service I received on my most recent visit. Because there was a simple misunderstanding about whether my order was for "here" or "to go", I was yelled at and scolded by one of the employees. As an independent business owner myself, I can't believe they would treat one of their customers this way (especially over something so trivial).
4569;Good chicken samosa but they don't honor their food reservations.I have placed an order, got a verbal confirmation. Drove there and they told me to wait another 40 mins. Terrible experience.
4570;The menu features a variety of items other than patties.  They include jerk pork, jerk chicken or curry, roast, or stew chicken served with rice.  There are soups, banana bread, samosas, and sandwiches.  A meal will cost around $5-7.  Then there are chicken, beef, and veggie patties for $1 each.  If you buy 3 it will cost $2.40 and buying more will generally give you a better bulk discount.  They also sell frozen boxes of patties to take home.  Something interesting to note is when the patties bake up and burst open or don't look visually appealing, they will sell those as 'seconds' which are generally cheaper.  To give you an idea, a dozen beef seconds will cost $4.50.I bought one chicken and one beef patty.  You can choose mild or spicy and I took spicy.  Both patties had a good amount of filling, and the spiciness added a lovely kick to the flavor.  But I thought the crust of the chicken patty was too thick that it was very difficult biting the sides.  The beef patty, on the other hand, was flakier and h
4571;I went to this Sunrise location for the first time on February 5th, 2015. I would like to mention that I've had eaten at Sunrise locations in Brampton, and I would rate them five stars. The friend I travelled to Sunrise with yesterday and others have warned me about Sunrise - I was about to learn that I had been pampered by the Brampton locations. At this Sunrise location, a friend went to get fried chicken and jerk chicken while I ordered oxtail. She placed an order for her and a friend, while I ordered for myself. As soon as I stepped to the side to let other people order, the workers completed forgot my order. My friend continued standing by the front, so they got her order together. I'll discuss my friend's order first. She paid for herself first, and all went well.  When she tried to pay for her friend's order with his credit card, she realized that the lady at the cashier entered the wrong amount. The food was on special for approximately $7.20 - the cashier almost charged her $17.20, almost DOUBLE 
4572;Food is highly not recommended. It seems like it was made by a child in a kitchen. It may look nice on plate. As far as I am concerned, the taste and quality of food is low quality. I've tried all skewers. It was excessively salty. Other food was less than mediocre for its price. Service is typical for its restaurant type.Would not recommend.
4573;Seems like they try hard but the food was really sub par. Not sure if  they were actually cooking fresh meat on the grill, certainly didn't taste like it. Even the negi tasted off (mushy in the middle).
4574;I used to like this place even tho is a bit overpriced compared with other Japanese restaurants but recently they changed their menu. They don't even offer chicken teriyaki. I understand they might be trying to not be a conventional Japanese restaurant but I think having some safe plates for people that don't like to experiment it will be better.
4575;Service & ambience: greatFood: not so muchThe Toronto izakaya space is very competitive with some great tasting food.  However, this is not one of them.  The seafood smelled & tasted fishy (mackeral, oysters, tuna), and even the chicken was subpar.  It's grilled chicken on a skewer, it shouldn't be hard to make that taste good.Also, when I called for a reservation, they had lots of tables available, but wouldn't take me till 8:30.  I hate the faking of high demand.I wouldn't go back.  I got sick after this meal.
4576;If I could give this place 0 stars, I would!  On April 5th, my wife and I along with our 7month old baby is looking for some dinner.  It was around 7:55pm that we left the house.  We were contemplating where we want to eat, and decided to call Kushi for reservations since I remember purchasing that Groupon.  I called them and they said they are full at the moment, however if we go after 9pm, we'll be fine.  I told them that it may be a bit too late for us so we did not make the reservation (we travelled from Richmond Hill to Downtown).  But we were assured that there's going to be openings after 9.  We tried going to another restaurant we had in mind but was full.  So by that time we decided to head for Kushi since by the time we get there, it'll almost be 9pm When we got to the restaurant around 8:55pm, I parked the car right outside of Kushi (a non-parking spot) and I asked the waitresses whether I would be able to use the Groupon since I did not make a reservation, but had received reassurance over the
4577;Although it is indicated that reservation is required, we decided to check if there was any available table. Surprisingly, there were a few tables available. The waitress at the door was really nice. She asked if we have a reservation and I told her that we don't have. I asked her if we I can order a coupon and redeem it now, she said of course. As I finished to order the coupon, she approached me and told me that we can't use the coupon because we didn't have a reservation. We asked to talk with the supervisor about this issue (I asked before I ordered the coupon!!!!). The supervisor came with a FAKE big smile saying that she is so so sorry. We told her that we asked the waitress before we ordered the coupon but she didn't care! What a bad costumer service. She said that there is nothing that she can do for us. We were shocked and we decided to leave. I have never experienced such a rude service. She didn't even try to stop us, she just said (again, with a FAKE big smile) 'have a good night'!!I would never 
4578;Ive been coming here for a while since its in my neighborhood however, the customer service is absolutely horrible and I won't be returning again. The two men working here have terrible attitudes and really have no desire to answer questions properly. One of the men looks like he hates his job and his life and he doesn't care about how he makes your food. After getting upset at me for asking to buy a drink with debit because I had no cash they started complaining about me in Arabic and pretended that everything was ok. I felt uncomfortable because they would not explain the fuss they were making. Im guessing they just didn't care to explain themselves properly in English. It does not matter how well or how poorly your business is doing you should never treat any customer like that, it's very dissapointing.Now comes the food, this is NOT the best shawarma in Scarborough by any means, its average at best.  The garlic flavour is decent but the beef is often tough and the chicken either dry or too fatty. Go to Sh
4579;dont be looking for any friendly service here. food was average to below average depending on your hungry level...we had a group of 11, its seemed like two grumpy old men was just not interested in doing any business.
4580;Decent food but waiters are rude, cannot speak English, and give bad service. I have enjoyed going to this restaurant before but this certain set of waiters have ruined the experience for me and I will not be going here again.
4581;Service and quality going down. Won't be returning anymore. Tempura was cold and overcooked. Literally 4 strips of chicken katsu. Seemed they were being stingy with providing green tea (the actual pot), I mean..if I'm paying 2.00 for green tea, give me the pot and not just the little cup. Guess I have to find a new sushi joint with good service.
4582;I don't understand how this is a 4 stars restaurant.  I went there for dinner.  My husband and I ordered two bowls of noodles and somehow they managed to get the thickness of noodles on both bowls WRONG!  When we asked them about the error, they didn't really want to change it for us and want us to take the wrong order.  So my husband ended up have his corrected and I am stucked with super thick noodles that I hate.  =(   Very disappointed.  Other than the fact with the order errors, I found their noodles and tastes are just average, decor is average, I don't know what's the hype! Will not return.
4583;I Just went to Bamiyan kabob with my wife for dinner and we ordered two half chicken dinners with Chapli kabobs. When the food came it looked little over cooked and once we started eating our food we realized the chicken was old & frozen and the taste was not it used to be. Their quality has gone down and they have also increased the price. I will never go back there again and I wouldn't recommend anyone to go there. The Canadian food inspection agency should visit them and fine them for not giving people what they are paying for and also check their high sodium content. Their food is full of sodium for some reason.
4584;Food is good but lowest customer service quality you could ever receive from many employees in there .. Cheap quality ..
4585;27$ for two dishes so a total of 2 small skewers and rice Naan tiny salad portion with Presidents choice ranch sauce and water. Jip. I can make life this under 5$. Also they try to sell you water and hide the free water jugs until you ask for it like a beggar.
4586;I came her for the first time and to be honest I was very disappointed with this place, food was awful, the new menu is nothing great. I had the chilly dog and to be honest i never had something as bad as that, the seasoning was overpowering and super greasy,i also got a chic-pea rap which was horrible, i don't understand how this place has such good reviews !! Come on people do you know what good food is ??
4587;After long-time patronage and recent ownership change, they have lost me as a customer forever. Same great menu, but man do they skimp on portion sizes, including take out cake slices. The place was also empty on a Friday eve, 6pm. Wishing them goodbye and good luck. I don't give them more than another 6-8 months.
4588;Where to begin. I normally go to the demetres in Woodbridge, but decided to give the one in Etobicoke a try. It was very busy when my friend and I went. We had to wait 30 min to get any acknowledgement from a hostess or server.  By the time they finally came, we had lost our spot in line. Ended up going to spin where we were acknowledge right at the door and helped quickly! Definitely won't be returning there! So disappointed.
4589;I want this place to be good, I really do. It's got a great atmosphere, good lighting and not bad service but, this might be the worst dessert place in all of Toronto. I've been here four times and every time I leave in disbelief of how terrible it is. Everything is incredibly processed, cheap ingredients and very tasteless. The crepes taste like paper and even the ice cream is flat. It blows me away that they can get these simple desserts so wrong.Do yourself a favour and save your time and calories for somewhere else....Or Caffe Demetre, you have all the right ingredients to be fantastic, so step it up.
4590;Had high hopes for this place b/c of the good reviews. Food was average, small portions, high prices. $80 for 2 ppl, that was salad main entree and a drink each. Will not be returning.
4591;Zara needs to be shut down ... They have the worst customer service ever. The employees are rude and the managers are even worse. I will never spend another dollar in there.
4592;Square one shopping mall food court absolute disaster, due to non courtesy & disrespectful people who are ignorant. The public washrooms are no different nasty, yes the mall cleaners duty is to upkeep & maintain the mall it doesn't mean people have the right to take advantage of others who work hard. As for the rest of the general public who actually do care & respect the premises that one enters for personal leisure. Highly recommend sq1 mall 1 of the best in ont.
4593;Update: Since inquiry minds want to know, here is the reason (which I found out after several emails to the completely apathetic Mayor) why I got the ticket (drumroll please) because I left the property to go somewhere else. So, If you are a mom strolling the mall with a baby but buy nothing, you are welcome. If you are a mall-walker just doing your daily exercises, but buy nothing, you are welcome too! But if you are trying to hit two birds with one stone and think you can park at the mall and do a few other errands while you're there, beware! Mississauga's hospitality knows no bounds! It made me feel so wanted, all warm and fuzzy inside, they really know how to treat their visitors. They had plenty of empty parking spots, I guess they just need some extra money for their renovations.I invite everyone to visit Unionville or Mainstreet Markham where the parking is always free and plentiful! You will be treated as a paying guest should be treated, not like a criminal.
4594;I hate this mall.   So many stores,  and yet nothing to buy!  The only good thing about it is the Cinabon! It's such a nightmare to find parking, except for the spots that are a few miles away! Avoid!   There are much better malls in Mississauga and Oakville!
4595;The foot locker in this location has the worst and most rude customer service. All employees have an attitude even though what I went in for was their mistake.
4596;Sunglass Hut in this location is in need of an amendement ASAP. Carla is the most impolite and unprofessional manager maybe I've ever seen. She's not smart enough for her position. As I went to return a pair of sunglass which I had purchaised a day before, she wanted to return me 10 $ less as she said " the systèm is saying to do so". The cashier and I were SO surprised and trying to return me back the same amount which I paid for but the manager insist to do what the Dumb systèm showing to return me back 10$ less. As this Time Carla tried not to have any eye contact with me nor replying to me. She just talked to her cashier. TOO much attitude.
4597;"Love that place. For the whole family" That was my old review...My new review is that it's sad that the mall policy doesn't allow taking pictures. I was taking pictures of some flowers by the mall gate. Just outside the mall, when two security guards came to me and told me I'm not allowed to take pictures. As it's a private property and as per the mall policy I'm not allowed to take pictures unless I go to the management to take permission from the Mall Marketing Manager ???I mean it's just some pics for flowers. Why would I waste my time get permission to take few pics of flowers ? I respect Malls' policies. But when it's that strict it interferes with people freedomI was holding a normal Canon 70D DSLR! Not a gun!I'm really disappointed
4598;Was quite disappointed given all the good ratings on yelp.First off, this little store is in the middle of nowhere. The 'mall' that it is in is largely full of empty units that have yet to be rented out. The plaza itself is poorly designed and getting through the parking lot into the parking garage is a challenge. We ordered a green tea waffle and a seaweed and pork shred waffle. Although both were made fresh to order, they were rough and stale-like in texture. Neither flavors were very apparent - some bites had me confused as to which was which.
4599;I came here super excited because they had HK Milk Tea Egg Waffles. I /love/ egg waffles and was happy to hear that they had a HK Milk Tea flavour for it.However, I was super disappointed. Firstly, the HK Milk Tea Egg Waffle made for the customer before me looked really nice (thought a bit burnt). However, when I was given mine, it looked like a sad excuse for an egg waffle. The "bubbles" were collapsed, the thin parts were /super/ burnt, and it was unevenly coloured. The only good thing was that I could taste the milk tea flavour at least. However, the outside was barely crispy and the inside was like mush. It wasn't worth the over 20 minute wait for it (though I was told it would be ready in 10 minutes). Overall, it was actually one of the worst egg waffles I've ever eaten. Perhaps I've been spoiled by the amazingly delicious ones I've had in Hong Kong, but the homemade egg waffles my mom makes are even ten times better than the one from here. I'd be better off just asking her to try and incorporate a m
4600;I came here on a saturday mid-afternoon and had to wait 10 minutes for 2 waffles. We got the original one and the green tea one. They were both made to be very "crispy" so when they bent it, it snapped in half. I was pretty excited cause I do like things to be crispy. But I first tried the green tea flavor and I didn't like it at all. It didn't match well at all. The scent of it was also a big turn off for me, maybe I'm sensitive, but it wasn't pleasant at all. I tried the original flavor, and it was much better, but it still had a taste to it that I did not like at all.After, I thought that maybe if I kept eating the green tea one, it'll be an acquired taste, but the more I ate it, the more disappointed I became. It was not good at all and it left my mouth and tongue feeling very "rough", the same feeling as when you eat excess pineapple or kiwi. I was pretty disappointed and I would definitely not go again.
4601;The quality of this place has gone down the drain significantly. I have been there 3 times over the last few months. The old man, I think the owner doesn't pay attention when taking order and when you correct him, he gets annoyed and has an angry face. His stuff seem they have had enough in the restaurant business and no longer interested. They warmed left over old rice in the microwave from the night before and put that in our rice platter order.In general save your money and get fresh shawarma platters else where.
4602;SUPER RUDE WAITRESS! Hope the girl either changes her behaviour or they throw her out!
4603;This place looks good on paper...... but the end result is not good.By way of example:  the antipasti platter looks fantastic according to the menu, but the included cheeses (not detailed on the mneu) are Swiss, aged white cheddar and a spicy Monterey Jack.  So wrong.  The cheese is served cold, sliced in 1-2 inch squares, looking like it's cut from a block of cheese from No Frills.  The meats are not much better.  The proscuitto wrapped bread sticks were okay.It's too bad Hooks (the former restaurant in this location) is gone.  It was fantastic.We will not be returning to Papa Giuseppe's.
4604;Nothing great. Way over priced for what you get. Not my idea of good Italian food.  Tasteless. the pizza's are ok. Period. I like to give a place more than one chance and I gave this one 5 chances. I'm nice that way. Plus I needed to explore their menu in order to give a good, not reactionary, review. I'm also not impressed with the, ermmmm, slightly unhygienic practices in the kitchen. I know why ive needed the bathroom so quickly after eating a meal there...They clearly need lessons on food handling. My last meal was a pasta dish and I chose gluten free pasta. It was horrid! Dried out chicken, almost all the pasta was broken into wee pieces and tasted stale for lack of a better word. I eat gluten free so I know what I am talking about. Also, during my last and final visit I witnessed people at two other tables returning food. Oh! I forgot to mention the salad. It too was tasteless ! How can that be? I've no idea. I can tell you that the dressing seemed to be only olive oil. And the wait staff always seem co
4605;Sushi was decent, tasted alright for its price. A really small place, not good for groups. Got combo meals with a friend. A handful of pieces (near the ends of the rows) were falling apart because there was not enough toppings in them. Plating was fine aside from that. (Just saying they have weird ginger that is not pink, which tastes off and I don't enjoy it)But, service was horrible! It was slow and people were rude.I asked the waitress about what their tempura ice cream was and if it was fried ice cream or something. It stated right in their menu "tempura ice cream" and she just had an attitude that felt belittling, saying what are you talking about there's not such thing. I mean come on, know what you are selling if you are working there. I guess no dessert for me. The attitude was a problem. Service is supposed to be friendly. Moreover, as I stated it was slow. It was not a full restaurant, but decently full (2-3 other groups of two). Lastly, of all things. My friend tipped 10% on the card machine, but 
4606;Don't know why this place has such good reviews on yelp.  I went there for lunch and ended up spending 20 dollars per person. Not cool. The food: it was just alright.  The sushi pretty much all broke. They tried to put a lot of vegetable in it.  And jts got no taste. The sashimi is fine. I don't think it deserves the price- 20 dollars. Atmosphere : the place is too small. The table is small. I felt u comfortable eating there Service : it was OK but the lady doesn't speak English and we had trouble understanding her. Also one thing I wanna say is that the people there are Koreans not Japanese.
4607;The lady that takes your order in this place is so incredibly rude, they have lost my business. I have been in here to eat and take out food and each time have been spoken to rudely. Tonight was the final time, it is not the right to treat customers or people in that manner.Food is average, not the best but was convenient location to me home.
4608;The waitress was un-attentive and made us feel that we were wasting her time.  Food order came wrong (vegetarians were served a beef dish).  I had to go to the counter and ask for another round of drinks, and finally to get our bill.
4609;Tried ordering take out the other day. A more mature lady (I believe it's the owner) didn't hear clearly what I wanted to order (my order was sashimi appetizer), and I was asking questions if they had anything just w salmon sashimi. I told her I wanted the sashimi appetizer, and I guess She was confused and thought I want both salmon sashimi and sashimi appetizer, when I told her I wanted just sashimi appetizer, she rudely stated " WELL THEN SPEAK CLEARLY" to me.  I told her forget about the order, and I walked away. I would never go back for experience like this.
4610;Rude af. I called to get delivery and the woman on the phone told me that my location is too far (I live a 5 minute drive away according to google). I ask how far they went, she named the street that turns into mine. I started to express my confusion and she hung up on me. Flabbergasted, I called back. Her response was "IM SOOOO SORRY. Can I hang up now?" Not only is this the worst customer service I've ever received from a restaurant, but the woman I spoke to was intentionally being rude to me. I was really excited to try the food here as it has great reviews but there isn't a chance in hell I'm giving these a**holes my business. Just goes to show that you can have amazing food but if you don't know how to treat (potential) customers then the food quality is irrelevant.
4611;I walked away feeling deeply dissatisfied with the meal and taken advantage of. Here is why: 1. NOWHERE in the menu does it state that rolls are tempura-laden. I ordered Qi Combo 1, described as: "spicy salmon, spicy tuna, yam". I thought "well, isn't this a pleasant assortment of light rolls". I knew "yam" would likely be tempura, but others on the table would peck at that. Those delicious salmon and tuna rolls would be all mine... nomnomnom. Well, when the tray showed up, it was just one mass of orange: tempura batter covered in spicy mayo. It was even impossible to tell what each roll was. I talked to the waitress and was even more appalled: - Me: "Oh, the menu did not say that these were all tempura, I cannot eat tempura..."- Waitress: "Everyone that comes here is a regular, so everyone knows these are tempura..." Walks away without apology or solution...Writing a menu assuming you will not get any new customers that need details on what they are ordering seems ridiculous to me. Tempurizing everythi
4612;Store is too small, it only carries a small inventory, over priced, products close to expiration date you need to keep your eye on it. I live within 10 minutes drive but I will drive to Burlington (40ish minutes) to buy my Dutch provisions. Owner is uncomfortably in your face,
4613;This place is small, wasn't busy when I went and its next to a really large pizza pizza. No bathroomsI came here with a craving for poutine, let's just say I love poutine with every ounce of my being. It's the epitome of being CanadianSadly, this place does not have fresh cut fries!! The sign on the exterior lists "fresh cut fries". Final verdict? Glorified harveys poutine, but double the price.
4614;This place was nothing exciting. The food was below average and the servers was angry and unfriendly when ordering. Overall not worth going to. I would recommend changing the place back to big burger where the burgers were actually good.
4615;The bartender tonight (August 5, 2015)  looked pissed. He also didn't seem to either a) like working there or b) like humans in general. He seemed put off and unwelcoming. So, I turned myself right around and left. Who the heck wants to sit and bask in that nasty energy? Not I!
4616;The problems begun when we walked in and the entire place smelled like a headshop.  Overpowering incense that was almost enough to make me leave.  We had heard good things about the cocktail list, and having both worked as bartenders my bf and I decided to stay and check it out.  First problem...table service.  This might just be a personal preference, but I'm a firm believer that a bar with no need for servers (no food) should be a pay at the bar kind of place unless you want a really high end lounge. Table service prevents mingling and makes for a stuffy bar.  Maybe other people prefer it, but it isnt for me. I especially don't understand the point when on delivering our drinks the waitress asked whether we were planning to order more (before we'd even had a sip!) when I said I wasn't sure she said "that will be $15.75 then".  Seriously, what the hell is the point of having sit down service if it is run like that?  We definitely weren't going to order a second round after that.  Oh and then there are drin
4617;I'm so confused as to why everyone loves this place. I HATE this place. I roll my eyes and swear every time someone invites me to a Friday or Saturday night birthday party here, because there is a line-up to get in at least 80-85% of the time and it's always one-in-one-out starting relatively early in the night.This in and of itself is not why I hate it I hate it because once you finally get inside, you realize that you could, as my mother would have said, "shoot a cannon through it," meaning, it's effing empty.I suspect this is a zoning/licensing thing related to the fact that they have tables and chairs and couches (so a seated, tables + chairs patrons limit.) But on Friday and Saturday nights, they drag most of these out of the way and everyone is standing anyways.Perhaps I'm soured by the fact that on Hallowe'en 2012, I told some smug white guy that his "I'm African" costume was vaguely racist, got into an argument with him over it, and then got chewed out by his insecure girlfriend who sidled up o
4618;We sat for 20 minutes before someone came out to the patio to bring us menus, and then it took another 20 minutes for the server to return to take our order. When we tried ordering, we were told they were out of what we wanted. No big deal, we'll get something else. Out of that too. All we wanted was a drink, and they had exactly one type of beer even though the menu listed several. The server disappeared to "check something," and we ended up leaving after nearly an hour without even ordering.
4619;This review is basically a warning. If I had written it last year, like I meant to, I would have given this bar 4 stars (I was in love with the mid-century decor and the excellent drinks). But I went back recently and something very bad's happened to this place. I suspect they changed owners? The decor is the same but the staff has been changed and in place of the gracious and competent guys and girls who worked there before we were treated to a parade of amateurs: a waitress who didn't speak English (we eventually had to mime what air conditioning was, that it was 13 degrees outside and that it was deeply uncomfortable to have it blasting), a bartender who didn't know how to make a simple drink from their menu and had to start over twice, a manager (I think?) who plopped his unwashed hands in a jar of pickles to fish out the garnish for a Caesar (which previously came with a classic, crunchy celery stalk like it's supposed to, not a slimy manhandled pickle). The drinks were so horribly mixed that, despite my
4620;I am managing a group of people. Going to different bars across Toronto in winter time and summer time.Bringing them 10 to 20 people every Wednesday. One day, they - the management - decided to host a comedy show. I asked them if it was ok the get my group here and chat. Despite the fact that they agreed , they treated us like a dog when their so-called comedy show started. We left and went to the Nirvana around the corner. I will never trust and tip such a bad management , after so many weeks being loyal and polite. The kitchen is almost non existent. I must say that the bar atmosphere is pretty nice and the location excellent.
4621;We went here the first time to celebrate my husbands birthday and we really liked the place. There were 8 people, and we had our own table, great time.6 months later, we went there to celebrate my birthday. I reached at 6.45 pm on a Friday and my friends were all still reaching. I requested for a set up for 12 people and one staff member started putting the tables together. In the middle of this a senior staff member came to me and said "Just because you are 12 people does not mean you can all get to sit. Its Friday night and its busy and we cannot give all our tables to you. What will I do when other couples come, they will go away. You cannot hold tables because you are early' !?I have never seen such rudeness or weird logic. We were paying clients after all, and the time we get in is our prerogative So we walked out, went across the street to Sneaky Dees which was crazy crowded and they actually requested a smaller group to move so they could give us a table. We had a blast. Try the 'Destroyer'
4622;Do not go here. We had a work function at this place and were not allowed to take advantage of the drink specials they had on b/c we had made reservations in advance. This isn't such a huge deal, but what was really annoying was the Russion/spanish bartender kept yelling at everyone reminding them that we cannot use the drink specials! Calm down...we all know now relax. He was super rude and condescending. Made a big deal when asked if we can split the bills. Really awful customer service.For the location, there are a million other cooler bars one can go to in the area. I would skip this pretentious bar and go anywhere else next time. That or DON'T make a reservation, then your group can take advantage of the drink specials. (which is what the bartender told us in a very condescending manner).PASS ON THIS PLACE!
4623;As many have said the service is horrid.  After 20 minutes of zero service and watching the staff lounge around and occasionally serve friends we just decided to move on.Too bad, because it looked like a cool place and had great atmosphere.  College St. has far better options.  Until these guys figure out how to run a public bar I'd suggest you try some of them.
4624;Wow. I have been ordering from here for a long time and really like their pizza. However, tonight I placed an order around 7pm and was called back 30 minutes later to say that they would not be delivering to me because they were too busy. When I asked how long I would have to wait, or if I could get a credit on my account they simply yelled at me and hung up the phone. What a terrible experience. These people are disgusting, unorganized and hateful. I even tried to call back from multiple phones to try to just speak with someone about my order/experience and they did not answer. Sorry Albany, you have lost my business completely.
4625;The pizza is great -- 4 or 5 stars on average. Delivery is usually great -- drivers usually arrive on time or early and know how to find me in the coach house. So obviously I'm a loyal customer. Then, tonight, I waited 90 minutes for a 45 minute delivery. I was *screamed at* by the dispatcher when I called to see what was up. Turns out the delivery dude didn't notice that the delivery was for the coach house, didn't bother to call me when no one answered the building's front door, and decided to sit around for 20 minutes banging on my neighbors' doors like they were delinquents. Said delivery dude then helped himself to a 20% tip. (Literally: he walked away with my change.) Points for chutzpah!Never again, guys. Sorry.(Not sorry.)
4626;Looked and tasted like crummy frozen pizza (not even good frozen pizza). Was really disappointed. I remember this place being good before, not anymore.
4627;After what seemed like ages, this place finally opened. Located on Main St in Markham, parking is typically not too difficult to come by. The place was filled when we came in to order takeout.  I opted for the roasted lamb dinner and my partner, the chicken souvlaki dinner. Not wanting the starch heavy meal combos of potatoes AND rice, we inquired if we could substitute the potatoes and the rice for side salad instead. We are told that we can do this for a charge of four dollars each. Hmmmm. We don't want the potatoes or rice and are charged for that in the cost of the dinner 'combo' but have to pay an extra four dollars apiece for salad. Worth mentioning is that this 'salad' consists merely of chopped iceberg lettuce, slightly browning, red onion, equivalent of quarter tomato and one olive with a very seemingly hesitant sprinkling of feta atop. The food was ok.  Nothing remarkable. We won't return as $54 dollars was ridiculous for the amount/quality of food we received.
4628;Walked out because no one served us!! Even though there was only 1 table of 2 ppl in the whole restaurant, they didn't acknowledge us for 5 mins. When you're hungry and the restaurant is dead, 5 minutes wait feels like an eternity. Therefore, we decided to leave and as we reached the door, the lady behind the counter says: Thank you for coming! Ummm right? All I said to her was oh no! We didn't eat or order. There was no service? Too bad! Because I've been there once and the food was good. I'll give it another try next time I'm craving for greek food in Markham. I mean, what a bad feeling to feel pressured to tip a server when the service is bad or excited to eat at a restaurant but nobody wants to serve you?
4629;Bad food even worse service do not waste your money or time. Staff do not care Watery bland salad, dry gyro. Server did not come to our table at all, we assign based on our body language and not eating our food they could tell we did not enjoy it. when she finally came to bring the bill we told her how unhappy we were she said she would speak with management and then just did not come back to the table at all. After 10 mins of waiting for our bill we finally went to the counter to pay. The server had not spoke to anyone about our complaint and just avoided the issues all togetherWhen we sat down the table beside us was also complaining and the server avoided there table as well Bad food is one thing and kitchens have bad days but terrible service and the experience we have is awful
4630;I find the service to be horrendous. The gentleman behind the bar didn't know price and WAS IMPATIENT AND ...TO MY STANDARDS RUDE.whether the venue is packed or not ....service is on the menu....oh and answer your phone!!! We called and couldn't get through ...we're now sitting here and the phone is ringing off the hook...Hello ....Ok...just finished eating ....I truly enjoyed the oysters and rhetoric muscles ....phenomenal ...makes up for the grumpy service I had earlier ...keep the old guy behind the bar and preferably NOT talking ...everyone else was super friendly !!!!
4631;I used to love coming here but it's gone down recently and it made me really anxious the last 3 times I've been. Three times I caught the waitress re-using other customers sauces. That is disgusting. Really? Why so frugal when Oyster Boy is clearly printing money from this place. I couldn't believe it. It's just simply not sanitary to re-use the Oyster sauce (I would understand if I had asked for more -- but this was a case of the waitress taking dishes back and keeping the sauces behind and adding more and then handing it out. Just - disgusting. Also, the stuck up customer service - priceless. Rude -
4632;WaS fine and dandy until the manager of my last visit was way too power tripping.  When it's slow she gave me all drinks no problem but when just she became controlling freak with my drinks!  She OK on staff shots and me having 7 glasses of wine when slow day but started controlling when I was offered drinks and started to act like she cared? If you want a parent to attend then this is the place to go to.
4633;Worst.  Service. Ever.Went there with friends and had the worst service of my life.  I have been a big fan of rodneys in toronto and joe beef in montreal so I appreciate that an oyster bar is a far more relaxed service environment but this was offensive.  Our server acted too busy to help us from the beginning.  When we asked what kind of beer they had, she responded "can no one here read?"  pointed to the menu and said she would come back in a minute.  she then repeated her statement to someone who came five minutes late.  the service went downhill from there.She  rushed us through our oyster selection and main courses.  Told us we were taking a really long time and that we should hurry up if we want to be able to order dessert. We encountered a few bad oysters that were spit out and no one wanted to discuss it with our server because of how rude she was being.  It was incredible!  I was extremely embarrassed to have suggested this place to my friends and will not make the mistake again.  I strongly su
4634;Consistently some of the worst service in the city. We went in tonight as a party of 5, and had one more friend drop by for a beer. We ordered 100 bucks worth of wine and 100+ bucks worth of oysters. The server was rude right from the get go, showing obvious frustration when she got to the table and we weren't ready to order. She rolled her eyes at us multiple times throughout the night. When I asked her what the best thing on the menu was, she said one word, everything. She forgot to bring waters to the table. She brought all the food out at the same time, apart from one persons main which came out 25 mins after they had already cleared the table, with no apology or explanation. There was no mention on the menu re: grat, but when she brought the bill, she informed the table that she tacked on 20% as that's the policy for "large groups". Wtf, since when was 5 considered a large group? Since when did restaurants charge auto grat without putting it in writing on the menu? Screw this place and their terrible sta
4635;I went to Oyster Boy, and all I got was shitty service and mild food poisoning. The Service was pretty slow, pacing was staggered between appetizers and mains. The Mussels really did a number on me. Unfortunately, it only takes one to really mess you up, and I won that Lottery. In fairness - it could happen just about anywhere...if the shell is open just a couple of millimeters, and it's not caught by the prep/cook - you're in for a long drive on the big porcelain bus.  A Day and 4 liters of Gatorade later, I'm convinced I won't go back. The Fish and Chips was great though...really filling, cooked perfectly. The Mollusk poisoning is why I'm giving it one star. It kind of over-shadowed the terrible service.
4636;The worst shawarma I ever had. The owner was very rude and greedy, and he put very little chicken in the wrap. I bought two shawarmas for 15$ and he used stale pita bread and didn't put enough chicken. The taste was total garbage. I hope these people go out of business soon. I would never recommend this place to no body. Total rip off and waste of time.
4637;Cheifs door serves good tasting food but cheap out where it counts. I unfortunately had to come back and edit my review for the unfortunate reason that they are simply cheaping out on the amount of shwarama meat they use. The taste of there toppings and ingredients are still fresh and delicious, but ive encountered this problem now on 3 separate occasions and sadly to say i will not be going back. The shwarma is essentially all vegetables with a very very small amount of meat, even when ordering there "large" options. There are plenty better options in Oakville for shwarma for this very unfortunate downfall.
4638;117 Cross Ave in Oakville location.Went for lunch and ordered  a "mixed shawarma pita"....double meat.  He started carving from the pit out front then went to the back....and came out with a fuller looking pita.  Half of my meat was moist and other half were dried, hard old pieces of meat.  I would NEVER eat there again.   Not a good start people as you have just newly opened.
4639;If there could be a minus review then that's what I'd rate this place.. I'd invited my brother to a small dinner here. When I was going to pay the owner said that the men should pay!!!  I lost the opportunity to treat my brother!!  Then the food smelled sour. We both had diahrea immediately after. Never going back!!! I'll
4640;I go to Pita Land religiously at the Don Mills location but this one seemed closer to my home. I definitely regretted this decision.I ordered my usual chicken shawarma to go and it was such a disgusting, saucy mess that I couldn't even take a bite without a glob of sauce dropping.  I thought I would give it a second chance since my previous visit, my shawarma was made by a trainee. I requested for less sauce this time but it was exactly the same: a big mess. The paper bag was soaked in sauce by the time I had brought it home and I had to throw it out as it had dripped everywhere. I've learned my lesson and won't be returning to this location.
4641;Slow and disorganized service. Rather would go elsewhere! Took us 1 hour to get it, seems like they had forgotten our order!
4642;The pizza was awful. Paid $25 and there were only a few vegetables on the pizza and they were dry and chewy, barely any cheese and the lady at the front was very abrupt. What a waste on money. Will have to try pizza libretto next time.
4643;Waited one hour for my pizza. The pizza was tasteless and very dry! Horrible experience dining here in terms of food and service! Many customers dining in restaurant was yelling at the cashier about their food! Cashier sold alcohol to people standing in the line without checking ID/drivers licence.Number one issue, there were some minor age people in the line asking to buy beer in the restaurant, the cashier took payment and gave the beer without checking ID. This happened repeatedly when I was waiting one hour for my pizza.Number two issue, I kept asking the cashier/server how long the food will take. She was clearly poorly trained. She got me and the other table confused and mixed up.I told the cashier/server I haven't gotten my food yet. Me and my friends have been waiting a long time at the table. The worker said " oh you didn't get it yet ?". THE EMPLOYEES HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DO THEIR JOB.I can clearly see the owner and management in this restaurant is poor and weak. When the employee doesn't kno
4644;I came here with my husband and my pizza came out, we kept waiting for my husbands pizza while mine continued to get cold. We asked the waiter multiple times where his pizza was, he kept reassuring us it was coming. After I finished my hard cold pizza, my husbands pizza still didn't come out we soon realized that they had completely forgotten about his simple pizza. We will  never be coming back. After all this they still charged us for my pizza. Terrible service.Ps- if you're gluten free stay clear definitely cross contamination I just had a terrible reaction
4645;Half a star.It's nice that some yelpers went out of their way to try and keep this place in business but that strategy just cost me 33 bucks. I'd rather a real Chinese restaurant take this location and give the area an option.Where do I begin? How about the packaged MSG laden broth for the Wonton Soup that is currently giving me a headache.Or how about the lemon chicken that had more soggy breading than chicken?Or perhaps it's the dry Szechuan shredded beef I asked to have extra spicy that turned out to be 85% onions and peppers in an oily terrible sauce that had no spice.Maybe the owner can come online an explain to me what was "Dry" about this dish? I expected something crispy.The fried rice had half of the grains still white and there was no flavour.This place has been here way too long, don't you find it interesting after all these years there isn't one pic of their food on yelp?In my 43 years of eating Chinese food I have NEVER TASTED WORSE.STAY AWAY YELPERS AND IF THE OWNER IS LISTENING YOU SH
4646;Very disappointing.  Had a groupon.   Very dishonest.   They've recently changed their menu so that 90% of their entrées are in a different section entitled "No-groupon entrées" . Nearly all the good entrées, like lamb, etc, have now been moved to this new section. This is strikingly dishonest.   If you don't want to do a groupon, don't.   But if you choose to do it, then do it right! Shane on these people.
4647;I used to go here quite often. My last two visits have been very disappointing. Are there new owners? :( Ordered the ten piece sushi dinner, and the tuna definitely wasn't tuna. I'm not sure what it was, to be honest. Aside from that issue, there was another piece of sushi I had to surreptitiously spit out because it tasted fishy and gross. I'm not sure I'll ever be back.
4648;Heard good reviews from friends that live in the beach and dropped in tonight to grab take out. Got the Sashimi-Sushi dinner($27). Was utterly disappointed with the quality of the fish. The sashimi portion was only salmon, tuna, and yellow tail very disappointing since i was expecting an assortment of 10 sashimi pieces. The slicing of the fish was thick and rough cut, hacked into chunky pieces with a dull knife. I wish i has the foresight to take a photos. I ate it anyhow as i was hungry and only found the salmon and tuna edible as the yellowtail was cut so poorly it was tough and chewy. The sushi was not much better, only this time, the thinnest slices of more tuna, salmon, yellowtail, a few other cheap assortments was placed atop of starchy clumped rice. The poor quality and execution didn't justify the price. The Miso soup was watery and flavourless.Felt duped by their wonderful website because what i received was similar to grocery store sushi.
4649;This is a review I didn't really want to write. Yumei Sushi has gotten progressively worse and the last few visits have put me off them entirely. In fact they might have put me off sushi in general. If you ask yourself why you are even eating something and apprehensive about it's safety, maybe it's time to start re-thinking the whole idea of chowing down on raw fish in the first place. Anyway, their fish doesn't look/taste fresh anymore and it seems like they're cutting a lot of corners. When I order maguro sushi, I expect it to be jewel red. Grey or pale pink is just gross and shame on them for serving this crap up and then charging a pretty penny for it. The one thing Yumei does right is the Korean Bibimbap. Guess this makes sense since the owner is Korean. I love Korean food and wish Yumei would just ditch the sushi and focus on Korean cuisine. So if you find yourself at Yumei, my advice would be to stick to the Korean menu items, everything else is a roll of the dice.
4650;I often find comments with "the best" and "the worst" quite exaggerated, not this time though, this is the worst sushi I've ever had. Fish isn't fresh with an extremely odd rubbery texture, sushi rice tough as hell :( I was nauseated afterwards. Really?
4651;They wouldn't accept a takeout order two hours before closing because they "ran out of dough".
4652;I can't even review my food because it's been TWO HOURS since I ordered it and the guy never came. I called the restaurant and all she said was sorry and that he left twenty minutes ago. I pre-paid on JustEat.ca so I won't even get my money back. Never ordering from here again. Better off taking that $30 and burning it in a cooking pot. It's literally the more sensible option.Update:Okay, I used JustEat help's service (a live "chat" via messaging system). Thank you to Seghen for reimbursing me and also giving me a voucher.The driver of the restaurant was a total thug and called to yell at me for getting him into trouble. Called again after I hung up and boasted "Oh you're too scared to answer now!" Um, yes crazy person. I am scared. What a bully!! Never ever dealing with this restaurant again and you can be sure I won't let anyone I know go here either. What a psycho!
4653;Wish I could give it zero stars this place is a nightmare super filthy would not recommend eating here
4654;I've heard from multiple sources that this place has great pizza. I'd love to tell you if I agree/disagree, but I can't because when I strolled in here at 9:30pm on a Sunday night, I found myself standing at the counter waiting to be served. The two workers were in sight, and even made eye contact, but they decided to keep doing what they were doing instead of turning their attention to me. A minute later, I was told that they were closed.But wait, it was only 9:30pm, and when I had looked the place up on Google it said they were open till midnight. I pointed this out but I was told nope, they were closing. I asked if it was just today or every Sunday, and I was told they close at 10pm every Sunday. But it was 9:30pm...On the way out, I noticed their posted hours just outside the door said they closed at midnight too, but I didn't bother. Oh, and so does Zomato and their very own website.
4655;I'm sorry, but a 2 HOUR WAIT for delivery on two pizzas???  I'm not even 2km from your store and was originally quoted 45 minutes.  I figured, it's a Saturday night...  That's not bad.  Then an hour later I call them and they say they're working on the order.  Too many customers walking in.  Give them another 30 minutes.  So here I am waiting in my hotel lobby waiting for the pizzas.  I call again.  They say the driver left 20 minutes ago.  I say BS.  Then they ask me to hold...  For another 5 minutes.  I call back, they say the driver should be there any minute and they offer 1/2 price on the order.  That was 10 minutes ago.  I asked them if they have other orders to deliver.  They say no.  Should be here by now, right?!?  NOPE.
4656;The customer services stinks. The owner is a terrible, rude, monster, and uncivilized peasant.
4657;Worst pizza I have ever had! I would never eat here again. It was dry and stale, disgusting!
4658;Tried it today.  This pizza did not hold up to the reviews on here.  Bitondo is better and it's close enough to Fresca.  This is not New York pizza. If you go there with this expectation you will be disappointed.  Pizza Nova is better too.
4659;No star - horrible experience. I went there for brunch/lunch and Manager has no flexibility as to an expired groupon i had and said i had to come back for dinner. No I'm never going back.
4660;Tavalod e 15 nafare ma delay shod by 1 hour. Nemikhastan money lose konan mehmon ba mehmon negah dashtan. Appetizers e ma oun chizi nabod ke ghol dadeh boodan. Bar ro zood mikhastan bebandan.

4661;UNETHICAL! This place has dishonest business practices. Read the original Yelp page for this business before it moved pages to escape bad reviews (the restaurant itself did not move, all of the contact information is still the same) https://www.yelp.ca/biz/leyles-seafood-and-steak-house-thornhill-2 Pay attention to the writing style and phrases like "excellent", "amazing" used in the reviews for this business. Notice how many other reviewers have only ever written 1 review.We came here using a $69 for a 3 course meal for two ($119 value). Incredibly misleading as the Groupon leads you to believe you get to choose items from the menu (which is posted on the Groupon site as well) In reality you are forced to choose from steak, salmon or chicken. The food:- cleanliness: so many flies... one landed on my food and I snapped a photo of it. - value: not worth the a la carte prices, not even close. The steak we had was the cheapest cut you could find at the grocery store.. I've had better steak in a steak 
4662;I went to breakfast buffet. I hear they have increased the price quite a bit over the last year or so. I ended up paying over 32$ for a single person with tax and tip. I arrived around noon. some of the food was so stale to the point you wouldn't eat it. All or party ended up getting stomach ache afterwards.I hear it was good food and good price before.My experience: Over priced and the food (the portion that was not stale) was not worth it. Friendly staff though. Would not go back and do not recommend it.
4663;Please see their old yelp page that they are trying to run away from. The restaurant has not renovated they just don't want people to see all the negative reviews on there.The old page has 38 fake reviews removed from yelp. There is a long list of poor management from the owner of this restaurant from Groupon scams to blaming the customer over basic complaints to stealing tips (my personal experience). Take a closer look at all the good reviews on here while some may be legit some are so fake over praising the restaurant and it's food.
4664;I love Portuguese food and Portuguese people but this place is disgusting, I saw one day the manager picking up garbage and recycling food, worse restaurant in Toronto.
4665;1 visit to bloom probably my lastI live in the area so most of my reviews are of BWV. This was a lunch with friend around 12:30. Service We sat ourselves because no one greeted us at the door. We sat in the window seat .The waiter was friendly and gave us menus with the specials. He did not ask us to move or mention our window seat as we were the only customers there. Close to the end of our meal , finishing our last bites approximately 35 Min's in, our waiter said we had to either move from the window seat or hurry and leave????? He said 2 people reserved the window seat and were waiting. Not impressed! Extras Yummy bread freshly baked or heated with house spread Large pitcher of ice water on request because the glasses were so small Food We both had the soup and salad Soup was good , I had a hair but did not mention it Salad was good but had way too much dressing The best part of the meal was the bread No butter available Ambiance  Seating comfortable Window seat nice while it la
4666;Nice decor however our food was all either over or undercooked. One of our guests meals didn't come until everyone else was done eating, even then it wasn't cooked right. Wouldn't go back.
4667;This is my first time at Chop, with the great reviews on this restaurant, I brought my girlfriend there to try it. The atmosphere is great but service extremely poor. We ordered prime rib and sirloin both medium. The sirloin came out cold, we thought it was because we chose the steak to be medium done. When we asked the waiter about it, he questioned us back saying "are you sure it is cold  with no apologies he said he will call his manager.  The manager came , again no apologies and just asked whether we wanted the steak to be heated up or if we wanted a new steak.  We chose to have a new one, the new sirloin came out perfectly after 15 mins.  However, our mood was already gone my girlfriend already finished her own dish.  After plates were all cleared, the waiter just dropped of the dessert menu on the table and left Without saying anything. This is totally unprofessional. This is the worst experience we had at any restaurant.
4668;I probably won't be coming back to Chop ever again. And I'll preface this by saying the Steak Bites...awesome. Caesar salad....extremely tasty. I should have stopped there & left. They get 2 stars because of those 2 items. Trying to find my waitress was like going on a fox hunt. Then I waited 1.5 hours to get my meal...packed up in a to-go box. I ate it in my hotel room. Basically I paid $90 for room serve without the delivery benefit. The prime rib was Outback quality & the mashed potatoes were flavorless. I asked about the crowd & the kitchen back up & was told that Tuesday & Thursday are their busiest nights....meanwhile it's a Wednesday. The restaurant is also located near the airport & center of a number of large hotels w/ numerous conference rooms. But it makes sense that if you are aware of your busy week nights, you would know to schedule more help. Right? Their OpenTable profile boasts abundant parking...Nope! They spent more effort on the dark lighting & waitresses tottering unsteadily in heels than
4669;We arrived (party of 6) and the hostess told us there were 5 groups ahead of us, so we went to the bar, and waited, and waited, and waited. After an hour, we went and asked the hostess where we were on the list - still 3 groups ahead of us. Actually, they overlooked us. We sat in the bar, but we're told to move so they could seat people on the waiting list.This place was a waste of time. Bad service, bad management, and we never got to eat. Too crowded at the bar, and they were rude.Best advice, go somewhere else.
4670;Worst experience. I didn't finish my steak - a first for me. I love steak, and this is the first time in my life I couldn't finish. I ordered it Chicago style as I always do but the layer of char on the steak was so thick that I dry-heaved at the table. Also, the steak was supposed to be 14oz but looked like a 10 oz. I called them on it and the chef denied it even though the server acknowledged that it looked smaller than a 14oz. The lobster mash was disgusting. The waitress was new and still getting the hang of things. I can understand that. Nonetheless, when she brought me a used napkin I almost lost it. Save your money and go elsewhere. The fries were good, as was the French onion soup. We will not be back.
4671;Never got a chance to eat there.  I purchased 2 American Express Delight Vouchers at $99.  each.  The server informed me that they were not valid.  Then the manager smugly also told me the same thing in the foyer in front of the two hostesses and other Waiting  Patrons.  I was totally embarrassed in front of my invited guests. Supported another airport restaurant, and had a wonderful meal.  Would never go back to The Chop Steakhouse based on the rudeness level.  My money wasn't good enough.  Turns out the vouchers were totally valid, and the server and manager were just either giving me grief or not properly trained at customer service.Save your money !!!
4672;This place was a horrible experience. Our server Nick was condescending and acted as though Americans were not welcome in this facility. His response of knowing we were "Americans from a mile a way, or kilometer" as he stated was one of the disrespectful and condescending remarks. There were many more.   Totally ignored our table multiple times and took us forever to get any response from anyone. Considering the amount of money we spent, a little respect would be appreciated. The food was average at best. Considering that, the attitude was not acceptable.
4673;I seriously wonder how this place has good ratings. My friend and I got prime rub (medium rare) and baseball sirlion. Both were flavorless and tough to chew. The baseball sirlion was so tough it was inedible. If this wasn't a business expense, I would have returned it to the kitchen and probably left. I've never done that before, but the food was THAT bad.
4674;Very Disappointed in the quality of food and service. Some of our family (9 guests) got together last night to celebrate a big promotion, and we were all disappointed with everything, we really don't think we will ever come back. Our server never checked up on us to see how we were doing, our water was never refilled, nor was anyone asked if they would like another drink. Those who ordered the lobster dinner, myself included, found the lobster to be chewy and vegetables that were served with it raw. The extra $4 upgrade for lobster mashed potatoes were not worth it, was there even lobster in it??? My mothers ribs came out 10 mins later then everything else, and it was only when we pointed out that my mother has not received her meal yet that the serve went to go check it out, later apologizing that the first rack of ribs were burnt and they were re-making it.....why weren't we told of this from the beginning!? NONE of our food was hot, everything was served luke warm, especially the steaks! The crab cakes an
4675;Ita understandable that big groups are hard for restaurants but the service was beyond slow. Took us over 20 mins to be seated when we had a already RSVP. We were than asked to move once seated because they sat us in the wrong area. After that..it took them 15 min to set up our forks n napkins. After ordering our drinks it took them another 20 mins ... my friend got her water 5 mins after we all got our drinks. Everything about our experience as just bad. We were all hungry n didn't want order fearing that the food would come after 1 hour. So we just had our drinks and left. Overall the restaurant is okay, but it was way to under staffed for a Thursday night. The restaurant was fully booked and they only had a handful of staff. Kinda disappointed because it was a celebration we were supposed to have.
4676;Had the chef's tasting menu. The service was sub par for such a nice restaurant. There was only one waiter for our area and he was not very attentive and did not realize that we were sitting for 35 minutes after ordering without any food at our table. His excuse was "I punched it in and don't know what happened", not very consoling for a $350 dinner. The food was sub par as well. Our expectations were much higher than what they delivered. The steak was dry and flavourless. The seared tuna was cold, the "greens" was a joke. They gave us a piece of shaved cucumber with a few flowers??? What a joke!  Overall one of the worst experiences for such an expensive dinner. Will not be going back.
4677;So I went to this restaurant for the 2015 summerlicious menu with my boyfriend and am sad to say we were greatly disappointed. The staff at the front desk was extremely polite and helpful where as our own server was terrible. Our seats were in the terrace which was beautiful at first, until the vicious mosquitoes came out to attack. The server walked passed our table twice knowing our cups of water were empty but didn't care to offer a refill. Overall this restaurant has too much hype around its name for no reason. Wouldn't return in the future because the service was sooooo slow.
4678;Great disappointment !  What a mess from service, to food, to waiting staffs running around juggling to Tables for various parties. For a $350 meal, we had practically no service, empty water glasses, over cooked steak (asked for rare and was served a well done)! Disclaimer:  We went to this ADP during the Winterlicious, but not to taste the Winterlicious menu. We ordered the full menu with drinks and wine!! But was served a meal that we could have eaten at Earls.Lesson for Auberge Du Pommier:  If you don't have the ability to do Winterlicious, DON'T!  You are attracing the wrong demographics, and are clearly showing the incompetency of your management team.I am a foodie, and after hearing so much hype about this place, we ventured my way out of Toronto downown to have a taste of Auberge Du Pommier. Nothing that I ordered was memorable except the over cooked steak and chaos in the restaurant. Our section had one waiter that serves about 20 people!  The restaurant is so understaffed, everyone was runni
4679;#Summerlicious 2017(My first one star review!!! Yay...?)So this place is supposed to be right on Yonge St, and I've driven pass at least a dozen times without ever noticing it. And today was no exception. Turns out it's actually in a plaza, and the sign is only visible FROM THEIR DRIVEWAY. How is that helpful for someone driving pass and just couldn't figure out where the heck it is?? I also spent like 10min circling the fences, trying to find an entrance...Gah, the French.My mood was visibly lifted when I got seated at the loveliest corner table. It had wonderful lighting, a leather couch, and the most elegant decor. However, it was what came next that dampened my mood -- namely, the food.Appetizer - foie gras (1.0/5.0) This was a mixture of something something something... I don't even know what they put in there, but it sure didn't taste like any foie gras I know. What it did taste like was meatloaf straight from a can, and no one even thought of pre-heating it before serving. The texture was disturbin
4680;I went to Auberge du Pommier for my bridal shower and had a great experience - friendly staff, great atmosphere, and delicious food. I decided to go back for summerlicious 2016 and it was a completely different experience. Food was average - salad and dessert were OK, but coulette steak was very salty and had a lot of gristhle. But most importantly, MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR BILL - my waiter charged me dinner price when I was there for lunch, and made 2 other mistakes while they tried to fix it.
4681;The meat was really bland and the tortillas has a really floral taste. The only thing going for this place is the size of the tacos.
4682;Firstly, I'd like to say there are better tacos than Tacos 101 and I've had plenty in Toronto (pork tacos were quite fatty - Ordered beef, pork, and cactus)!  After I paid over $23.73 for over-priced 5 tacos, I expect at least average service.  The cashier, whom I suspect is an owner or at least he acted like he thinks he's a big guy, had light coloured hair/blonde Caucasion in 30s, a bit out of shape was extremely RUDE.  I explained my order a few times because he didn't listen and when he finally understood, he was just a rude.  No hello or even thank you me for helping him make money.  FINE.  On top of this, when I asked if I had the medium hot sauce bottle because I wanted to put sauce on my food, he said yes and "ORDERED/TOLD" ME TO FILL SAUCE INTO HIS EMPTY DIP BOWL!!!!  Yes you read correctly.  These dip bowls were at the counter, beside him for customers to dip chips inside to try the salsa sauces.  I don't care how busy it was.  Asking (especially rudely asking) a customer to do your dirty work is of
4683;Ordered 2 carnitas and 2 fish tacos to go. I got 3 carnitas tacos and when I brought it up and shows my receipt they gave me another carnitas taco. Fish tacos cost more by the way
4684;It's over hyped. So many better taco places in the city to go to. Ordered 2 pork 1 chicken and 1 fish taco. Flavorless, no spice and super dry. Meat is over cooked and fillings unsavoury. For what you pay $4 per taco go to grand electric or LA carnita
4685;Good Day:Thank you for reading my post.  Tacos 101 did not deliver at all on their tacos.  I was looking forward to eating at the restaurant considering all of the positive posts.The service, ambience were pleasurable for how small the business is.The tacos were extremely small and not hot or tasty whatsoever.  I was expecting a better product and experience.  The size of the tacos are appetizer size so make sure you order a few to satiate yourself. Govern yourself accordingly, Taco Bell is open and available for Mexican food.
4686;This is the worst place to eat. The owner will try to rip you off a few dollars here and there. You will get rude and unfriendly customer service. The food is over-rated by others and I find it tasteless. I have been here twice and always disappointed. I will not return.
4687;This place is the worst osmow's franchise my husband and I have ever been to. They had the worst customer service from the cashier and the manager when we were there for lunch on a weekday.
4688;There was a shawarma place in this location before Osmow's and it was so much better. The food at Osmow's is alright but the service is horrible. Rude lady working the cash with no people skills. I wish the old place was still here with the friendly staff and the much better garlic sauce. I don't understand why people come here.
4689;I really wanted to like this place because I love Caribbean food. It is a charming hole-in-the-wall spot and the folks who served me were super kind. I love little restaurants and always want to support them, and hey, maybe you will love it here! Clearly a lot of people do! But let me explain why I won't be going back. Price: $20 for a little drink and lunch seemed a bit ridiculous to me, especially for the quality. The helpings of food were decent but I honestly cannot finish it, nor do I think I'll be able to. I took a shower before eating here, and after trying to finish the food (but not being able to) I feel grease and oil seeping out of my pores. I took the leftovers home and was thinking I might be able to try to finish it by adding some raw greens & plain rice but honestly I need to throw it away, like $16 of food which is a huge fucking bummer because I am not a rich person and when I go out to eat I want it to count! My big criticism is the food is just so fucking OILY/GREASY!! I absolutely cannot
4690;Did they become dumb?! I've eaten in this place tens on times. I eat out a lot. Yes, their food is good compared to their price and the location is convenient. However, staff currently working there are the most stupid people I've ever seen. The girl who works there can't serve people (which has always been so, we just try to order from bar and avoid her) but what happened yesterday was really unacceptable.My friend had problem breathing and high palpitation, we asked them to call us an ambulance. THEY REFUSED!!!! I would sue them if I were a lawyer. After we called 911 on our own, and when paramedics were on site they showed up with bill and their bank machine! I still can't believe these people and don't know where they come from, but what they did was far from being acceptable.Hopefully my friend is fine. It was a food poisoning.
4691;It's really sad that I have to further downgrade Hair of the Dog after my third dinner here.  It turns out that dinner 1, which was pretty good, was a fluke.  Visit #2 saw me sending back the most charred, disgustingly burned burger I've encountered in my life.Visit #3 saw me again sending back the burger.  Here's a hint.  Do NOT under any circumstances order the burger.  The other issue was that out of my group of 8, a few people ordered about 15 minutes later.  After waiting for exactly 90 minutes after placing their order, their food was still not there.  The waiter "had no means of communicating with the kitchen" to see where the food was, so they opted to cancel their food, pay for their drinks, and leave to go eat at McDonald's.  This restaurant needs to step up its management both in the kitchen and the front of the house, because it's a disaster right now.  The pretty patio is nice in the summer, but I'd stick with just drinking, and avoid the burger like you'd avoid Ebola.
4692;I visited this pub last weekend for a bite while doing errands. The patio's gorgeous however the food and service was below mediocre. I ordered the Angus Burger and when it arrived it looked pretty dry, as in the bun looked dried up and when I attempted to eat it, I wasn't edible- the patty was burnt and of course tasted charred. I returned it and told our server about it twice and she simply laughed it off- no apology and no attempt to offer me another burger.. The bill arrived and the burger was still on it despite the fact that I didn't eat it. I had to ask to have it removed. Poor service + Terrible food was my experience- hope yours is better!
4693;Horrible service. Rude and impolite. Sat upstairs and waited for a table downstairs but then were denied service. Too bad. Not the normal service I've experienced here.
4694;This place was amazing five years ago, I don't know what happened. The food now tastes awful- the hollandaise sauce on the eggs benedict was really sour, the eggs had a strange texture and the portion of homefries was tiny. My girlfriend ordered a scalloped potato dish that made her nauseous. It was super oily and looked like it came from a hospital cafeteria. The service is also extremely slow. We were literally the first to arrive when the restaurant was empty, and somehow the last to be brought our food after all the people who arrived after us were served.I tried going back a couple times to give Hair of the Dog another chance, especially because my experience a few years ago was so good, they have a beautiful patio and it's literally right across the street from my apartment. But it's just so terrible.
4695;Pro: The music is calm and soothing. Con: The patrons are neither.The scene: we go for brunch at smith and then meander down to the Hair of the Dog pub for a post-brunch glass of wine. In a clumsy moment of what was clearly a drunken stupor at 3 pm, one of the patrons knocked over a bar stool. My dining companion and I, startled by the noise look over to see what happened. Upon gazing at the disaster before us, we were publicly and quite loudly lambasted by the perp for "rolling our eyes at her" - long story short, after several attempts to halt the screeching accusations  and reassure the said drunken patron, she made a public display to showcase her 'taking the higher road' by singing Let It Go at the top of her lungs as if we were the ones to create the spectacle. This being said, apparently every patron who frequents this joint is in various levels of delusion and/ or denial. After witnessing our trauma we were then notified by the server that this aggressive disaster of a woman and her motley cre
4696;My trip to HOD was terrible. I waited forever on an omelette. When I got it, they messed up my order. I asked for a salad to replace the home fries but got the fries instead. When the hostess started loudly rolling silver ware next to me (I was sitting at the bar), I just got my food wrapped and left. The only bright spot was a very nice bartender/server.
4697;Never again. I was there last night with a party of six. An 18 % tip was automatically added to our individual bills. A little presumptuous, but fine. The kick in the teeth was rudely being asked to leave less than a few minutes after paying to fill other tables, while patrons who had been sitting there much longer were left alone.
4698;It seems every time I go to this Resturant they never have what I want on the menu. This was the third and final visit to this Resturant. Strike out!! To top it off, my table saw a rat run out of the back by kitchen (we where not the only table that saw it too - we looked over at another table and the lady had her feet off the floor - cuz it scared her too)
4699;The servers at this place are either desperate for patrons or need a refresher crash course in Smart Serve. I can't even begin to describe the motley crew of degenerates in this place. There was an old lady who was drunk as a skunk, slumped over in the corner talking to herself. There was another drunk lady who I'll call "Mary Poppins" who inserted herself into my conversation with a friend to berate us for saying some children aren't grateful. She became enraged at the mere mention of us referring to specific family members who she does not know, so to keep in mind that these are our opinions. Luckily she packed up in a huff and took herself and flower hat elsewhere.Now for the two disasters seated at the bar (how appropriate) - two more intoxicated females who had no business drinking another drop. One got up and knocked over a chair, and upon looking over at the noise, my friend and I were screeched at for supposedly rolling our eyes. Fingers pointed and causing a scene, the lady was very angry that we d
4700;Imagine sitting down in a group of six....ordering a few beers...then being told that a) they won't split a bill b) they tack on a gratuity c) then being ignored the whole night d) finding the tacked on gratuity is 19% e) never going back to Hair of the Dog again.Food was decidedly mediocre...good fries though...specialty coffee's were overpriced and just brutal (we ordered four different ones and nobody was happy with theirs)
4701;I feel absolutely terrible saying all of this, but my experience truly was a one star experience. I am visiting from California and tried this based on the reviews. We ordered burgers with poutine as well as beers. The beers were bottled, and were of course what was expected, which is good. The burgers were burgers, nothing more. The buns were very good, clearly from a local bakery. The poutine was extremely soggy and had been left in the kitchen for a while. One of the burgers came without the salad ordered, and when sent back for the salad, it took a while to come out. We were never offered water, and when asked for it, we had to ask another waiter as ours was taking shots at the bar. After the shots, our waiter never did return to us. The jalapeños on my burger made me very thirsty, but we were unable to get the attention of the other waiters even though we were one of the only tables in there. We are very nice people, and I feel bad that I still tipped well. My opinion is that maybe this place is going th
4702;Service is very slow. They cannot handle a Saturday crowd. It would be better to turn people away than have people wait. We are getting drunk due to lack of food. Help!!!
4703;Heard great things about this place but wasn't impressed at all. Unprofessional, annoying staff and mediocre food
4704;had brunch here and was disappointed that I wasn't able to order the butter chicken grilled cheese. Ordered the eggs Benedict, the eggs were really over cooked and the hollandaise had way too much citrus in it. The service was horrible, considering we got here right when it opened I was shocked by how slow the service is. Will not go back
4705;So we came here for my friend's birthday. We went up to the patio which was quite nice good table arrangements with a nice view. This is however was where the nice experience ended. After our initial drink order (which our waiter was not happy that it would be separate billing) it was like literally moving a mountain to get anything supplementary. You would think that a bar would be trying to sell booze but when the waiter comes around every half hour and you actually have to flag him down to take an order, you realize that your presence must be a nuisance. After a while of playing coy, our waiter just told us that it was not worthwhile for him to service us (funny considering he was never actually there to take an order) and that we all had to close our our cheques and someone else would come instead. Closing out the cheque meant a mandatory 20% tip for poor service. Then apparently one of our friends had gone to the literal roof top (with others) which meant we were now kicked out... Even though we did not
4706;As a Korean who grew up eating at this place when I was a teenager, I came back to try it again. The place has completely become a place for for NON-Koreans, as a matter of fact on a weekend lunch I didn't see one other table of Koreans. The side dishes which come out first are complete disasters - they look Korean but they are not korean, the end. The kimchi is extremely sweet (red in color but so salty and sweet) and the radish is also drenched in sugar you could feel the sugar grains. If the owner and the workers don't eat their own food for lunch what does that say about this place? I'm quite sad to know that there are a lot of Torontonians who believe that this is what Korean tastes like.
4707;I've been to this place many times but I will not any further because... I've found a long black hair three separate occasions. Each time they replaced my meal but each time there was no apology. Once it was in a side dish with he fermented beans. Then one hair in my bi bim bap around the middle as you try to mix the ingredients. Lastly, one in my soon tofu. I know that a hair won't kill me but it's vile to experience and also shocking when they lack the courtesy to apologize. I told them after my first experience that the cooks need to wear a hair net which they didn't have one. After the second time, I warned them that if I find one again, I'm never coming back. I've been to certain restaurants downtown hundreds of times and never a hair... 3X is just pure ignorance and negligence.
4708;We waited to be seated for about ten minutes. Were rudely treated by the waiter who seated someone else first, who arrived after us. Walked right past us to do it as well. Then the entire staff continued to ignore us. We left and I want back in to ask if anyone saw us standing in front of the bar for the last ten minutes. "And no was all he said..."  Will not be returning anytime soon. I am not easily offended. That was ridiculous. Too bad. Their pizza is almost worth their staffs arrogance.
4709;If you are coming here for the pizza then don't bother. Average at best -heck..even worse than domino's =/ -too pricey and they take they take too long.
4710;A first-time visitor I thought that the Newfoundland eggs benedict sounded wonderful.  I had to leave in 55 minutes for an appointment and told the waitress.  She said that the order would take 20-25 minutes.  Fine.  After waiting 30 minutes the table behind me was complaining about the long wait for their meal and that if it didn't come immediately, they would have to leave.  Their waitress apologized sincerely and their meal came a few minutes later.  Better late than never.  After waiting 40 minutes, still no sign of my order.  Even if the meal came that second I would have to down it, pay the bill and get to my appointment, all in 15 minutes.  I complained and was told "There are no guarantees here."  Clearly there was a problem in the kitchen, but one table gets a genuine apology and, for the same complaint, I get grief.  Really terrible.  I asked for the bill ($11 for one beer on tap and one tiny orange juice).  This meal should have taken 15 minutes to prepare--20 max.  Double that time and still nothi
4711;Breastfeeding babies and mommies are not welcome here. The manager was so kind that she said she'd be able to move a chair to the washroom if my wife wanted to feed the baby. You don't eat in the washroom why should a baby eat in one?Will never be going back
4712;I ordered so much food based on these glowing reviews. It was not good. Nothing was good. Not flavourful, too greasy, poor quality of meat, forgot the dry noodles for my chop suey even though I paid extra for them. Yuck
4713;A group I belong who meet monthly have met here a few times the owner is very nice and has been accommodating to us. It's a nice spot. However, I have had two meals here and both were unsatisfactory. The most recent was a grilled cheese sandwich and how that could be messed up I don't know it was almost cold and hardly grilled. I will not be eating here again. Such a shame because it IS a nice spot.
4714;This place quality dropped significantly. Had a chicken burrito today and had to throw it out after few bites. Missing seasoning and under cooked chicken. Awful.
4715;Excited when BB was going to open a spot near my hood.  When I ordered numerous times there realized it's not as good as the locations I have gone to. For example stave bank, lakeshore and Queensway locations have some fresh burritos there..  It's just a good reminder that these places are Franchises and that some places can't replicate the quality of food and service at the better locations that put BB in the TOP.  Noticed that they're stingy with food hence the scale they have in the place.  Other BBS I've been too doesn't do that.  Now when you order a seafood burito for $10+ you expect it to be good and fresh. 1st time it wasn't,  shame on them. 2nd time around not good again I've let them know about it and unfortunately they weren't able to help me about the poor quality food. Shame on me I guess for giving them another try.  This location is dragging the good name in the mud.  I will play smart and drive to the other locations that do it right.
4716;Food is bland with no flavor.I've ordered from here twice.  First time found a hair in my burrito and didn't go back for years! Decided to try again and they got my order wrong when I picked up and didn't notice till I got home. I am done with this place.
4717;What happened? I ordered a large burrito for pickup, and they forgot to put in both rice and beans! That is like a burger without the meat. All I had was vegetables and the meat inside. The burrito fell apart in my hands. Someone made a mistake with my burrito. Afraid to return.
4718;If only I could provide negative stars. It was my first time ordering last night and I called at 10:30pm to place a delivery order.The woman who answered checked with the other staff as the kitchen was closing. Then she proceeded to take my order. I ordered a couple things then was told their minimum is 25$. So I ordered an extra item. Then I was told that delivery is an extra $5 because I "live too far". She took my address, phone number, asked how I would pay, then hung up.Not only did no one ever show up with my order, they never even had the decency to phone back to say they changed their minds.Worst ordering experience I've ever had.
4719;I've eaten here a few times and each time the food is passable but something about this place perplexes me. The pho soups are decent, well priced at $8.95  and the Thai curries very tasty and consistent.The coconut rice, while tasty is a bit of a rip off when substituted  for the accompanying rice ($2.50 )  Pad Thai noodles are soup like and should be avoided at all costs. They verge on being putrid. Appetizers from the starter section are vastly overpriced and portions miniscule. A Kalbi rib starter offers 4-5 small pieces at $10.00 Brutal value as they are quite average  !!!  5 micro shrimp spring rolls $ 5.00 and are tasteless. Avoid. And try to find a shrimp in any of them.Service. Hahaha lol. Very peculiar.  Sometimes the delivery guy will take your order, sometimes the 11 yr old niece will , perhaps the woman who owns the place. You can be rest assured that groups of even 4 people will not have their meals arrive at the same time often separated by a staggering 15-20 minutes. Seems the wait staff ha
4720;Sure to tell everyone I've been a chef for 42 years I can taste and I'm seeing the cans in the kitchen. Knort swiss makes a pho powder as in base. Which is filled with charcoal I'm sorry I know what I mean but I don't have time to explain it chemicals and that's why it's so cloudy and thick. It's not made from scratch to make a consommé is made out of meat not bones this place uses powder. That's why my coeliac friend gets sick when she goes there it's not the rice noodle it's the broth. But sometimes you have to do what you have to do to survive
4721;We used to be regulars but not anymore. This restaurant has the most disrespectful staff, more specifically manager, we have encountered. They told us the delivery would arrive in one hour. It arrived in TWO hours. When we called, instead of apologizing and explaining the ridiculous delay, the woman proceeded to yell at us and somehow blame us (very weird) for this delay and say that they don't even do delivery (we've always ordered delivery from them) . In the end we gave up and ate cereal at home, that is how upset and disappointed we were with the whole experience. We told her she lost longtime customers, she said "too bad it's on you" (again, not sure why). They don't deserve customers, they are incredibly rude and ungrateful, not to mention horrible ethic. She called us an hour later, we thought, to finally apologize, but no, to say the driver got a "ticket from police". I highly recommend you guys get your Thai fix elsewhere. They don't deserve the hype.
4722;"Little" Coxwell Restaurant indeed ... Little taste, freshness, spice and finally little service..I like to check out new places without preconceived expectations built up by glowing reviews which after all are extremely subjective so I am rather surprised to see the 4/5 star rating for this place. In an effort to keep the body primed for New Years and the ensuing eating/drinking marathon about to commence, my sweetie and I decided to order light the night before ...  #77 stir fried veggies with rice and #71 garlic pepper shrimp  with rice. Called in the order to pick up and they answered promptly (later I knew why), pleasant reception by order taker and food promised in 10 mins.  I arrived approx. 12 mins later to pick up and spied what I assumed was my order on a table nearby. A woman (the owner) was on the phone motioned me to sit at a a nearby table and when she was off the phone asked if I was paying cash. I was not and pulled out my interac card. She grimaced and asked me again if I was paying cash,
4723;I have been coming here for years and now that it's become more popular with the reviews, I feel as though the restaurant doesn't take care of their food. I love finding hair in my food and I know it's not mine because my hair is currently blonde. Two thumbs down!
4724;I was really looking forward to trying the food here.  My partner and I have our usual favorite restaurants for Thai and Vietnamese, but we wanted to try a new place in the neighborhood, and this place had really good reviews.  Apparently, the staff didn't find our patronage necessary.  When we arrived and sat at a table, we were brought menus, a bottle of water and cups.  We read through the menu for about 5 minutes and then waited for our order to be taken.  And waited.  And waited. At about the same time we arrived, a table of guys also arrived.  During the time that we waited, this table had their order taken, they were given drinks, and actually had food served.  Also during this time, the same server taking care of this table, also talked on the phone, I assume taking orders - fine, then kind of stood around the till, took another phone order, then stood leaned against the door jamb of the kitchen, and then got the food for the aforementioned table.  I was ready to go after 15 minutes of being ignored, 
4725;How is this place 4 rated stars overall?! I came here expecting above average pho but I walked out disappointed. Immediately when I walked in, I noticed there was all caucasians...so i was thinking to myself what should I expect. I ordered the rare beef pho, they only had one size and the price was $9.75...i mean talk about overpriced?! It was even more dissatisfying when the bowl came out. All you could see was layers of oil. The broth was so cloudy, you couldn't even see the meat or noodles under it. Then I started eating it, broth had little to no flavour and they literally dumped the beef in a big chunk making it hard to separate. Just horribly disappointed. This place doesn't even deserve a two star because it was literally a hole in the wall, it was so pretty dirty inside. Definitely not going back.
4726;Looks like there is a change in the owners......chaos reigns supreme. Take out orders wrong, challenging wait staff. New owners doesn't appear to have any previous restaurant experience. Came here on a Saturday for my pho fix. Was told to seat our selves, they were busy " clarifying " a take out order with a customer. Had to wave a server over to take our order......And then we waited. Food was flying out the door, delivery guy flying out the door, while we waited and waited. The solo blind customer was promptly seated and served his wine and dinner....while we continued to wait. The party of three was seated and served their food while we waited.....To add insult to our growling stomachs, the waiter returned and asked if the order he had written down on the piece of paper was correct?! At this point I informed him that since he had not placed our order and we had patiently waited more than 20 mins for our food...that he could save himself the trouble of placing our food order. Luckily our back up Thai place 
4727;I used to love this brunch spot but now that it's under new management and new ownership they have really terrible food and abysmal service.Had eggs benny. Asked waitress for eggs to be medium, they came basically raw. The white part of the egg when you poach it should not be completely runny, it's unedible slime... you know what. I'd specifically asked for medium eggs and got raw ones so I ate none of my eggs. Also ordered the spinach benny because I am vege, they serve baked beans with your meal that have bacon in them so if you're a vegetarian you can't enjoy the beans.My main issue is that I asked specifically the way I wanted my eggs to be poached because so often they are underdone. I was told they did them medium as a standard. When they arrived they were not.I'd eaten at this restaurant for 20 or so years, I will not be going back unless there is a change of ownership. The food is terrible.
4728;I have been coming to this establishment since I was young. Unfortunately since it reopened under new ownership the quality has drastically gone down. I'm disappointed that my favorite neighborhood restaurant has become one of the last places I would want to go. I truly hope they make some improvements and bring back some if not all of the quality and taste they  use to have.
4729;Please keep in mind that this review is dated, but I thought I should share this experience as it was by far the worst I've ever had in any establishment service wise.Sunday morning brunch, there was a large group of us, adults, teenagers(17-19), and kids (about 10 years old). Now I know what you're thinking: kids at a restaurant are a nightmare and our waitress probably just got a little impatient. Wrong. We were all pretty well behaved, talked amongst  ourselves, used our please's and thank you's, etc. The woman who served us was flat out nasty and there was no reason for us, or anyone for that matter, to be treated this way.Anyways, we get there, and we were told that we had to sit at separate tables because it was so busy, which was fine. So the kids/teenagers sat together at one and the adults at the other. The adults had no problem with the friendliness or speed in terms of service.We, however, were severely mistreated. Our server, a woman in her 50's or 60's, slammed down our drinks, practically 
4730;I love the bus terminal. For those that don't know what i am talking about. That's ok, it's gonna be...ok. But after reading this, hopefully you will be encouraged to go check it out.It located on the danforth, just 20 seconds walk east of coxwell. It is directly south of coxwell station, (halfway between station and danforth).It is one of my favourite diners in Toronto, definitely.It is actually an old bus station, and not much has been changed from the exterior, nor the interior.  It has actually been used in a bunch of movies e.g. Get rich or die tryin,- The food is excellent for its price, which is pretty damn cheap. - The coffee is great diner coffee.- The service is always 'right on the ball', and the ambience is so chill.The ceilings are covered in old vinyl album sleeves, and they constantly play old jazz on the stereo system.Its not at the greatest location in the world. There are probably not many reasons for any of us to head out to danforth and coxwell, but Come on.... Hop on the sub
4731;My friends and I were so humiliated... Four of us last night were looking for a place for a bite to eat and some drinks, and after reading all the great reviews of Graffiti's, we decided that would be our destination. It was around 12 a.m., there was live music drawing us in from outside.. seemed great!Very small place but seemed lovely and intimate. Two guys playing live music, sounded great. My friends and I stayed in the corner by the door while one of scouted around to see if there was any room for us to sit or if their kitchen was still open (no on both counts, which was fine). Since it's winter, my one friend thought she could quickly check on her phone what was nearby while we were warm. The musician deemed us unwelcome there and, while, singing and performing, proceeded to walk over to us and open the door to show us out. We were so embarrassed, and laughter from inside, as we were the butt of a joke, followed us out. I've never felt so unwelcome. Was the complete opposite spirit of Kensington which
4732;UPDATE: I received a phone call from the chef of the restaurant. He saw my review on Yelp and left me a heartfelt apology about my experience at his restaurant. I appreciated the gesture very much.-------------------Very disappointed! I was so excited to eat here with 3 of my friends especially after reading these very positive and enthusiastic reviews. The food was mediocre 2.5/5 but what was worst was the service. The chef doubled as a server and I'm sure although he meant well was incredibly disruptive to our dining experience. He would not stop talking, be unaware of the social cues of our table and was at times offensive. At the end of our meal the group of us sat and talked and he just stood a few feet away reading a magazine hovering over us. His presence and conversation made us uncomfortable. I would not suggest going here.
4733;I would select half a star if it was possible. I came here today with my boyfriend and sister and at first I was hesitant about going inside but from the reviews I decided not to judge a book by its cover. THE FOOD WAS HORRIBLE. Worst meal I have ever had to day. We got two lobster raviolis and a chicken Alfredo. That restaurant should under no circumstances be labeled as italian, the inside of our lobster raviolis tasted like EGGROLL!! Please save yourself the time and don't bother. You're welcome.
4734;I hate having to write 1-Star reviews, but after eating here last night I am seriously wondering if ill ever be able to trust a yelp review again. I'm not sure who these other people are that reviewed this place and if these accounts are even real but there is NO WAY this place could ever get a 5-Star review.Anyway, I decided to take my girlfriend here after reading all the reviews on here. When we arrived there was only one other table with people on the place and I knew this was a bad sign and even considered leaving, but decided to trust the yelp community.Upon entering we were greeted by the chef/waiter who was very nice. We decided to order the calamari and mussels to start and both had the gnocchi. We both had a glass of wine to start, and my girlfriends had a bug in it so she had to wait for the server to cook something in the kitchen before she could get a new glass (which the server happily exchanged). The server started us with some bruschetta on the house which was fine then we got our apps.T
4735;I don't know if they had an off night but...some food was not cooked, overall experience was terrible. Everyone in the restaurant was complaining they weren't getting their food. Or one person at the table wouldn't get their food and everyone else did. The service was atrocious. Came for a bday so sorry we did. Sorry to the restaurant for this awful review but this was brutal. Waiter didn't even know the menu or the basics.
4736;1 start because we drove an hour to get to this restaurant and they wernt open yet it says its open from 11am to 10pm. We came at 3pm.We were really hungry and didn't have a back up plan so were forced to walk up and down the street and settled for tacos.
4737;We used to love schmaltz and would go out of our way to make sure we got our weekly smoked salmon there. The service was incredible with a focus on education, the product was delicious and the prices were reasonable. Unfortunately after a summer away we find this has all changed. Our experience this morning was disappointing to say the least. Service was lacklustre and uninformed. The salmon was cut thicker then my steak last night and multiple types of salmon were all packaged together making it more difficult to keep. The prices are now uncompetitive with other options, especially given the disappointing experience.
4738;The guy with the beard and tattoo up the left side of his neck behind the counter is among the rudest individuals I've ever met in customer service - pompous prick. The food was great but this guy shouldn't be dealing with customers...ever
4739;Decided to visit this place because of all the great reviews on the bagels and lox. When we arrived, the exterior had what we assumed would be a great, peaceful vibe. However, I wouldn't recommend this place solely on the customer service. They were rude, and rushed our order, without bothering to explain the options, or making any recommendations. When we asked them what the choices were, the answers were rushed and quite curt. For the food, Bagel was a little on the stale side, and it couldn't be made better with the average-tasting cream cheese, though the salmon was decent.
4740;Food was horrid.  I tried to scrape the fish and liver off the bagels.  Simply to salvage something from my 36 cad order.  But it must have sat for a bit as the flavours had seeped into bagels.    It was awful ... I'm not being dramatic when I say it made me. gag.   Pickles and chips were goodDon't waste your money.  This food is so bad....  ack !!
4741;I don't have high expectation for McDonald's. All I know is I suppose to get acceptable fast food and fast service..........Walked in wanting to get a treat after having lunch next door and the place was crazily busy. The reason was not because this McDonald's is the coolest place to be, the staff here were just so disorganized and slow...Our Strawberry Sundae, Soft Serve Cone and Iced Coffee took forever to be ready! Not like those are custom orders or need to be cook!!Lines just kept getting longer and longer........ I just want my ice cream!!Sadly my ice cream was meh as the cone tasted stale............ FAIL!!The only good about this location is the dinner area opens 24 hours! Maybe I will be back  if I am drunk, hungry and desperate........
4742;I tried their chicken pakora. They were basically chicken nuggets fried in an Indian spiced batter. The chicken was overcooked and tough. It seems the chef doesn't know to cook chicken breast. Their description of "tenderly cooked" isn't entirely accurate. Their food is in my opinion, highly overpriced. $10.95 for dal? $15.95 for biryani? Even the most lavish restaurants don't charge near as much. I have had much larger pieces of tandoori chicken breast, truly prepared tenderly, that cost about the same or less than these greasy versions of chicken nuggets. I have also had chicken pakora from other restaurants that are better prepared, more flavourful, and not nearly as greasy, in this same neighbourhood.Their response was to argumentatively try to justify the price by telling me that the special spices make the food that expensive, as if they were introducing a new taste to an unfamiliar and uninformed people, who had never had Indian food before. After that, I did not care to discuss the food quality wi
4743;Very disgusting.. I was told by the waitress that is fresh food, everything is made in the spot. Came up to be dated food, frozen chicken, the food was cold, externally bad. I would only recommend it you want to hate Indian food.
4744;We always used to order from this restaurant through uber eats but last night I decided to call the restaurant to order and a young woman answered. She asked for all my information regarding home address and phone number, took down my order and said the total amount that it will cost and then proceeded to tell me the food will be delivered to me in an hour. An hour goes by and I call her back and she says she never put the order through because i didn't tell her what I wanted and the phone cut off as I was giving her my phone number. Then after she said she called me back which she never did and apparently a man answered saying wrong number. I would understand if she just simply forgot to give the order to the cook as that may be an HONEST mistake but she kept lying saying she never took my order, I didn't give her my phone number or address or even the order itself. I find this ridiculous because she gave me the exact TOTAL AMOUNT for the food. How would I know the total amount if she "didn't even take my or
4745;Food was ok, but service was terrible. Spending a nice evening date and being rushed to eat your meal and get out is a major negative for this place. Had one woman singing to herself that she couldn't wait to go home. Had another employee begin to put up the chairs. Another one sweeping up the place...thanks for the dust kicking up. This was all at about 8pm. I figured it was closing time and we were past our welcome (clearly) but etiquette usually sides with the customer finishing their meal and having a coffee. Little did I know when I paid my bill and left, (while being followed by an employee to shut the door behind us) I checked my phone and they close at 10:30! Used to go their for the food, but after this experience, won't be back.
4746;Too bad one of the brothers that owns the place is one of the most deplorable human beings on the planet. Simply because of his personality and the way he treats people including his staff  I have boycotted this place for 10 years.
4747;Came in on Saturday evening. Ordered the caprese salad, tomatoes I found to be really overipe. Ordered the Quattro pizza. Was not impressed at all. Not very appetizing. The food was just awful. Don't recommend it
4748;it's come to my attention that torontonians wouldn't know quality italian food if it kicked them between the eyes. a growing line out the door & rave reviews by fellow yelpers was enough to persuade my wife & i into checking this place out on a saturday night...& we instantly regretted the 80 bucks we dropped. calamari was tough & rubbery, poorly breaded, & bland as all hell. my wife's linguine con gamberi included inedible, overcooked shrimp, a foul-tasting sauce, & undercooked pasta. my gnocchi had an affable tomato sauce, but the actual dumplings were a chore to chew through. even the wine tasted like a cheap bottle you'd buy off the $4.99 rack at a corner store. i'd bump my rating up to 2 stars if the servers didn't bring our food to the wrong table & award us with the distinction of being the only patrons without water. maybe we should have tried the pizza?
4749;Service was terrible and it is unfortunate because the food is actually quite good. My understanding is that this staff have been there a very long time so it seems as though they don't care about customer service anymore. Will never go back to this place because of how we were treated.
4750;Food mediocre. I suggest going across the street to The Big Slice...pizzas were burned. and the salad was a joke...$8.50 for argula & lettuce and TWO slices of tomatoes?!Horrible service waitresses non-attentive, had to call them several times to get attention. Wasn't given bread or oils like everyone else in the restaurant, had to ask for the bread and ask another table if I could take their oils (since they were leaving). When asked horrible waitress to box our leftover pizzas, she included the crusts and other pieces of food we were throwing out in the box. I highly do not recommend wasting your money at this joke of a place.
4751;I'm having a difficult time trying to digest the other three reviews, especially about good value and portion size. My friend had warned me it was expensive but I didn't know what I was in for.First of all, the menu items in the restaurant/store are actually more expensive than noted on the website. Also, there is no pricing on a lot of the items (i.e., hummus, bread, eggplant dip, etc.).I wanted to order some hummus because I love what they serve at the restaurant a few doors down. The server confirmed it was the same product and she said she would give me 500g but didn't completely fill the container so it was more like 400g. I asked if I could get the same bread that they serve at the restaurant but she tried to push these Turkish bagels on me. She let me try a piece and it was alright but way too heavy to eat with hummus. The problem is that nothing is really on display so it's hard to get a visual of what to order. Anyway, I requested the bread again and she asked me how many I wanted. I had no idea 
4752;Placed an order of Teri Shrimp Burrito during lunch using Ritual. The roll consist of Shrimp, Kani Salad, Carrot, Edamame, Cabbage, Cucumber, Sweet Corn, Tempura Bits and Teriyaki Mayo. Theoretically, this should have been a delicious lunch. In reality, unfortunately, the shrimp and tempura bits was extremely oily. As well, the roll was sitting on the counter when I picked it up. The dressing was dripping through the paper wrapper. The roll was soaked through. It was not appetizing. Overall, I am not sure who fell short, Rolltation or Ritual. It was just not enjoyable. I would not recommend that combination!
4753;Came in the other day, don't remember which day it was but the burrito was a complete let down. It was really busy so I figured me and a friend would grab and go and chill at EC. The fish smelled weird as I ate it and it ended up making me throw up later on. I really didn't like how the seaweed was also raunchy like it was also fishy. This time I got the Wasabi Tuna. the seaweed salad also got stuck to my teeth sooo dont expect nice smiles after eating this. The wasabi sauce was so overpowering like the "normal" amount or whatever the girl recommended was just TOO MUCH. Why don't they have a visual guide of the sauce or like some sort of visual at all??? The spicy mayo is fine cause its nice but wasabi mayo??? I really hate how they don't double check when they make your burrito, it seriously does not kill anyone to take an extra 10 seconds to ask bout the sauce otherwise you get gross combinations like the Wasabi Tuna.The sad part about this is that the Wasabi Tuna is the "#2" on the signatures when it
4754;Barely any meat. Not that good. Rather have actual sushi for the price. Instant regret
4755;Not sure what the hype is all about.  There was barely any fish and it was ridiculously sauced up.  I couldn't eat it because it was just mayo on mayo and on a lot of rice.  The dish it itself had too many conflicting ingredients that didn't mesh well.  I bought their set wasabi tuna bowl which came out to be $16.95 after tax. Restaurant pricing for subpar quality fast food.  Hugely dissapointed.
4756;What a disappointment. Chicken souvlaki very small and dry, rice watery and potatoes dry. This place could learn a thing or too about good Greek food.
4757;Good place to go if you want come decent sushi at a low price. Terrible service however... I ordered a bento box and clearly stated which one. When they gave be the wrong order and I told them what I actually order they basically told me tough luck.
4758;This place was utterly disgusting, the food was colder than my ex's heart. The fries were staler than a bag of 5 week old chips. I can't express how disappointed I am, not to mention I feel like fluids are going to leak out of every hole in my body. DONT EAT HERE. Run while you can.
4759;Buca is an absolute joke! Servers are pretentious and rude.  Food is overpriced and nothing special. No one ever makes you feel welcomed in a genuine type way. HTere are so many other Italian restaurants in the city with far better food, prices and friendlier staff. The only thing you have going for you is the space and decor, which is impressive.Gusto 101 puts you all to shame.
4760;Whats up yelps, its your boy - no not drake your other boy from rexdale homie. Just got home from a heavy night of binge eating, I have a problem. My biggest problem is I don't get paid enough at my other job (I sharpen pencils for a living) so I can't support my eating habits. So if  I have my next 5 reviews at different Burger King's please understand.I feel like this place should be called Sambuca cause I think they were drunk when they made the dishes & prices on this menu. I went with my family (9 of us) we sat in the corner it was nice  There was a brown guy on a date - if you take your girl here - your obviously tryin hide the fact that you were too lazy to think of a original place to take your girl out so you take her to a restaurant on king thinking you gonna be all posh. Whats the point, you eatin can food mon-fri. #Prech #PreyformeekAnyways. We ordered the whole pig and the chef gave us the head...it was alright, some parts were really nasty like the pig cheeks, I say nasty because it was pret
4761;Came in here one night with my friend. Terrible terrible service. My friend was given her dirty fork back to her after it had been taken from our table. Our waitress was VERY snooty! I had just had surgery 2 weeks prior. The seating is VERY uncomfortable and the restaurant is NOT wheelchair accessible nor is it stroller friendly!!
4762;I'm sorry to say, I usually don't do reviews but I went here with my boyfriend and a friend and the phrase "value for money" plays no part at this restaurant. For a bill that totalled $160 for 3 people, we had two pizzas that lacked flavour and one pasta dish that was reportedly delicious but not worth $28. Don't be fooled by the truffle mushroom, they were not anything like the authentic black truffle mushrooms that I have had before... Very disappointing
4763;Extremely overly priced.  Food was better than average but not for the price. Portions are small too. I've been to other places that are better quality and cheaper.  I loved the bread knots but even that was pricey.
4764;I would like to say this is why I prefer south Italian food, which this is northern, stricks me as (being half of both northern/southern) for better food and better value (4x the amount of it!) : I am 22 years old and went here with my boyfriend for our 5 years.. he chose it even though there was no menu online, which we would have liked to have seen. I felt bad cause when we arrived we saw how expensive it was, very sneaky not adding the menu. It was SUPER OVERPRICED AND TINY PORTIONS. My gnocchi was in a yellow cream sauce.. it did not look appealing, had probably 7 little gnocchi's and was stone cold! cream sauce shouldnt be STONE COLD.. my boyfriend also had cold pasta and a tiny portion.I think its crazy CHARGING FOR BREAD, $8. I went to another italian resturant prior and got the exact same bread free (every customer as it should be with a meal!)the waiter charged my bf and i the larger most expensive glass or wine without asking us!!! we got the bill and the WINE IS MASSIVELY OVER PRICED.. I have ha
4765;Have never actually eaten here.  I had a reservation for this evening and after number of attempts to cancel no one answered the phone.  They called to see if I was still coming and after hearing the attitude of the gentleman that called me I have no desire to give them my money or time. L'unita and Sotto Sotto are amazing Italian restaurants in Toronto and know how to treat a patron. There are so many great restaurants in this city with amazing food and service, it's a a shame when an establishment in the service industry don't understand the importance of customer service.
4766;Huge disappointement.  Food was below average and lacked flavor.  The branzino was overcooked and tasteless.   The Bigoli was undercooked and ordinary.   The service was subpar.  The only thing worth while in what we ordered were the brussels sprouts and the "agrumi e ricotta". Perhaps our expectations were too high...?!?!
4767;Extremely disappointed with our experience here last night. Starting with not enough light to read the menus to the very minute portions. The main course was the size of an appetizer at most other restaurants.  The price is no indication of the quantity. When ready to leave it took approximately 45 minutes because of the lack of credit card machines to losing one of our coats. The coat check room which we insisted on visiting after about 20 minutes and three people trying to find the errant coat. All the coats are layered one on top of each other and our coat was at the bottom. The coat was finally retrieved but the whole debacle took so long we missed the entirety of our next event.  The situation was pointedly unaddressed by anyone in management
4768;I'm not one to give bad reviews, but I just don't get it.(Let me state now that I'm not a fan of rich foods, so this definitely plays into my review)Everyone says this place is amazing...most of the reviews (on Yelp and elsewhere) and even my friends who I've spoken with.  The restaurant was very cool and the ambiance was very nice, so that's a plus.  But the food was, in my opinion, terrible.  I ate there last night (Jan. 26, 2011) and I left wishing I had gone to Pizza Pizza or McDonald's.I've eaten my fair share of Italian food (both American-ized, and during my travels throughout Italy), and Buca did neither any justice.So, we walked into the restaurant to find the place very busy, and the ambiance very cool.  After making our way to the bottom of the stairs, we were standing there for several minutes among some departing guests waiting for their coats, so it wasn't easy to find where to go to claim our reservation.  Not until a couple minutes after they left, did someone approach us and ask "has 
4769;Totally underwhelming. The high scores on Yelp actually makes me feel sorry for people who probably haven`t really tasted good food before. The pasta was not salted,  and tasted like.. nothing actually. The fish (pickerel) had absolutely no seasoning-just a white fish with nothing else on the plate. I don`t mind paying for good food, but this was ridiculous.My thought always is, if my Jamaican mother can cook a substantially better Italian meal than a so-called `Italian restaurant`` can serve, then you don`t deserve to be charging these ridiculous prices with false bravado.
4770;I am sad to review Buca with a one star rating. After visiting Buca a couple of years ago and having a fantastic experience, I decided to revisit with my husband this past week. My 36 dollar gnocchi was way too cheesy and the lamb brain way to salty and the list goes on... nice atmosphere but definitely overpriced for what it is.
4771;Our visit to Buca was deeply disappointing. After reading much reviews, we bought into the notion this was a great place for dinner. Sadly it is over-hyped to be called one of the Top Restaurants in Canada.Service was rude, derogatory and pejorative. Our server snickered when we declined to order wine. He questioned why we wanted to share appetizers, pizza and an entrée instead of offering us share plates.Our Branzino took over 30 mins to arrive after we had almost finished our pizza.I would not recommend Buca to anyone local nor visiting. There are too many choices than to endure bad service.
4772;This review is solely based on the way I was treated by the maître d'. I left immediately after having to interact with him. His condescending manner and style of addressing us on entering was so incredibly rude that I lost all desire and appetite. I see that most of the negative reviews on here reflect that same kind of experience with the staff. If I am about to spend a good deal of money on dining in an establishment I would expect that the experience be hospitable and respectful. I am happy that I did not and will not ever spend a dollar in this place. I often entertain clients and was doing so this night, but we moved on to Bent and had an incredible experience and meal. Life is too short for a place with this kind of attitude.
4773;Our visit to Buca was extremely disappointing. I came here tonight with my two friends and we were extremely surprised as to how amazing the reviews are here. We ordered $130 of food with no drinks 3 entries and 1 appetizer so we were pretty pissed at our wallets being $130 light with terrible food and service. I've never minded spending money on food - as long as it serves up to it, but Buca did not. Our food was horrible and the pizza my friend had was the worst pizza shes had. The service was good (when they were quick to take our coats) but our waiter was extremely rude up until we had to pay for our bill (she wanted a good tip). I am so extremely disappointed in this restaurant especially with all the hype going around about it. I will not be back here and to all of you who are debating on "enjoying" some dinner who don't bother. You'll be $100 lighter and starving when you walk out that door. Ps. The pictures I've uploaded might look good but don't be fooled!
4774;Well, have been dining out a great deal in this holiday season. This experience at Buca Osteria Enoteca on King was so negative I had to take the time to warn potential customers.First of all, dining out with another couple, as we always do, we requested separate bills from our waitress, Kate.We were informed that we could not get separate bills but would have to figure out the split ourselves. Seems wherever else we've dined this has never been a problem, but I guess at Buca they just couldn't provide the customer service to do it for us. The restaurant is very very dark and it's difficult to read the menu without the flashlight of your iphone. To add to this the sound level at the restaurant is so intense that in order to communicate with each other we found ourselves yelling.Not fun.To add to our general disatisfaction we were told if we want to have bread we would be charged an additional $5 for 3 buns and a few bread sticks. Forget it.Get me out of here.The food was ok but it was overshadow
4775;Underwhelming. The bread was good, but at at restaurant like this, should have been free. Salumi was decent, but has nothing on Van Gameren. Pig ear needed to be braised longer before they were fried, and were bland. Should have been served with citrus, or some kind of dip. Mains were small, and mostly bland. We had the branzino, which was good, but boring. The black cod was pretty bland as well. The pasta with scallop sausage was boring and the sauce was uninspired. Tasted basically of lemon. The sausage stuffing in the quail overwhelmed the delicate quail flavour. Overpriced for pretty basic food. I will not return.
4776;in a word - AWFUL. The night started with a waiter who advised us that we needed to order quickly because we could only have our table for 90 minutes (note: we were 15 minute early AND we were not told this when we booked). The meats were 'fatty' - the cheese 'was sparse' and the salads were a 'joke'. The only thing good about the night was the wine and it was rudely over priced. Trendy 'yes' worth going 'no'!
4777;Don't spend your money here. Two years ago I was told this was one of the best high end Italian restaurants by a friend. I'm not sure if something has gone wrong with this restaurant since then but my first meal there in Dec 2016 was overpriced , dry, over cooked and weirdly lacking in flavour. We had the stuffed fried olives which were overcooked and dry. The noudi bread balls were cute but again small and hard ( overcooked) with only a little tiny speck of softness on the inside. It was just a few tiny balls of dough in olive oil and rosemary. The tortellini dish was a disaster. I have had amazing broth based pasta dishes at less expensive restaurants in the city. What minuscule amount of pasta we got was dry and tough, the filling had very little flavour and the clarified chicken stock was lacklustre . The dish lacked any herb and would have looked a lot more appealing if it had something else to bring flavour and colour to the dish besides the yellow tortellini and a similarly coloured yellow stock.  Hone
4778;Great food, great wine, overpriced, ridiculously poor service. At the bar first, 5 drinks=120 dollars. Completely nuts.I have never had a lag of almost 2 hours between courses, anywhere in Toronto, anywhere in the world. Told that the food is coming, time and time again. No explanation why we were waiting for such a long time. In their defence, they comped us our mains, but only after I walked over to the most managerial-looking fellow (who was very polite) and explained our situation. I feel they should have offered without my asking.Food itself was very well done, but a 30 dollar plate of pasta should not be sized as a second of four courses. To get yourself a proper-sized meal, one would have to order a salad, a starter, a plate of pasta and a "carne" plate, To do so would make Buca one of Toronto's most expensive restaurants. At around 9ish, the clientele began to change....Jersey Shore-esque (girls in microskirts and heels, heavily-scented dudes with GIANT watches, T-Shirts with Boss logos, etc).
4779;First let me start of saying the food was absolutely delicious (minus the dessert), however, it was the atmosphere and service that compels me to give Buca a 1 star.When we first arrived, the restaurant was not too busy (out of the two tables beside us, only one was occupied). When we first sat down, my boyfriend and I sat on the same side of the table and read our menu when our waiter rushed over and scolded us - we were told that he had to move to the other side of the table (mind you, there wasn't anyone beside us and there was plenty of room but okay fine). We ordered the warm bread knots and eggplant apps, which were really tasty. I had the clam pasta and my boyfriend had the fish - both were very good. For dessert we ordered the panna cotta (was okay). Now this is where things got bizarre.We didn't finish our dessert and it was gluten-free. My sister from out of town was visiting and she has a gluten sensitivity so I asked them to pack it up. Our waiter then came over and said he couldn't pack the
4780;One of the worst experiences going out I have ever had . Called ahead, made reservations under my name, and got seated at a table with some other couple, including a loudmouth drunk who it seemed had never been to a restaurant before. Asked if I can get a more private table and the maître d' said "well yeah, but it could be an hour." We said fuck it and went across the street to gusto
4781;This restaurant used to be one of our favourite pho places for the last several years until today. Unfortunately, we found used limes mixed in with our bean sprouts. The only explanation I can think of is that the bean sprouts and limes must have been reused from another customer and simply mixed in with our order. We are unsure if this was simply a mistake, but it is unhygienic and unacceptable.
4782;No. Just no.I met a friend here for lunch at noon in the middle of the week. I arrived first an asked for a table for two. They told me sit at table 7, that made no sense to me because table numbers are not posted on top of the tables, luckily they pointed to the table that was in front of the cash counter. I flip through the menu while waiting for my friend, a staff came by, dropped off a pot of tea with one cup and taking away the other menu. I'm pretty sure I told them I wanted a table for two people. A minute after that, she came to ask if I was ready to order, this was when I told her I was waiting for a friend. It wasn't busy at all, so I wasn't sure what the rush was about. My friend arrives shortly after and we order some spring rolls with our perspective bowl of pho within 5 mins of her arrival. It didn't take long for the spring rolls to arrive and I must say I was shocked. Two of them came on a plate, and they were about a centimeter thick and half the size of the oblong plate, For $5, that was
4783;My wife and I had Pho. It was alright until my wife noticed a piece of hair in the soup, she picked it up with her chopstick and it was obviously a pubic hair, she was disgusted and couldn't eat the rest. We showed the waiter and he looked pretty embarrassed. All he offered was free spring rolls on our NEXT visit. Are you kidding me!?
4784;1) Overpriced for the portion size. $7.5 for a 'Large' pho that is equal to a medium in most restaurants. Don't let the pictures fool you, the bowl might be big but 80% of it is soup.2) Soup was way too salty and not enough pho flavour (such as star anise and other spices used in pho) it seems like they were trying to mask the lack of spices with extra salt.The only good point is the atmosphere which is very new and fancy for a pho place and the service which was very courteous probably because it's new. I will never go back though because the food was sub par to say the least.
4785;Unfortunately the food was awful. The service was great, but nothing tasted good. I ate the lamb and at first it was served without all the elements of the dish on the plate. Flavours were very bland. Very disappointed.
4786;HORRIBLE. why does this place have such great reviews?! The pad thai was INCREDIBLY salty and the noodles would break so easily because it was overcooked.  The chicken satay starter was horrible defrosted boiled chicken with no real flavour if you don't put the sauce on it.  The Massaman Curry's beef was tough and dry. The Basil Crispy Belly Pork had zero moisture left in it and was hard enough that I could barely pick it up with my fork.  I understand that people might think this place is great because it's cheap, but really that's all it is. CHEAP fast food.  Not like I expected fresh meat that isn't frozen.  But nothing is good about this place.  Not sure what the hype is, I think people are just excited for a thai place in this area.
4787;Environment: A stuffy and cramped space combined with the absence of air conditioning, you'll sure work up a sweat. Parking: A small parking available in the front of the restaurant however it is shared between neighbouring restaurants/stores, so definitely limited. Service: One of the server was inattentive and actually walked out while we were placing the order to pick up a phone call (cell phone NOT business phone). Order wasn't exactly placed in/got lost in the kitchen somewhere. Waited about 20 minutes before we asked for a status check on our order then waited another 10 minutes or so before our food arrived. No apologies or explanations offered during the wait. Server had audacity to ask for tips and was not too happy. I wasn't either, as a customer. Food: My bf ordered the Khao Soi Siam and I ordered the Ramen Tom Yum. Both were decent, though nothing to write home about and not deserving of a return trip. * Pictures on the menu would've been useful.
4788;I really dislike giving scathing reviews but I terms of this place I think I am doing a public  service. Maybe they're OK for dining in the restaurant but I doubt it.So I ordered from there last week. And every dish was horrid. The pad thai was just a bunch of stuck together flavourless nonsense.  I can make better at home frankly. The whole mess was $75 bucks and I just felt ripped off. Even the rice I ordered was wrong and they sent shitty not even Jasmine or sticky rice instead. I called to query and suddenly there was a language  barrier. Frankly....worst meal EVER.
4789;Things are going downhill here. Im not sure what is up with the management but they are trying to present an image of Thailand that isnt very favorable. It gives an impression to all customers that this is how Thailand is. Im being very vague because I dont want to offend anyone. If you decide to eat in you will see what Im talking about. I wont be returning.
4790;I'm not sure how this place got this many stars. Came for dinner one night. Perhaps an off night but one we experienced1) service was slow2) food came slow3) service quality was ok for an Asian restaurant. I saw two other parties get poor service.4) they ran out of their curry puffs and ran out of mango sticky rice. How can they have run out of those things so early in the evening?5) no ac, but super fans blowingFood: decent
4791;I came here for lunch.  It's a small restaurant with only a few tables.  We waited over half an hour for our food and the food was just so so.  It definitely doesn't worth the wait.  The thai iced tea tasted like sugar water.  Service was bad.  Will not come back again.  If you really wanna try this restaurant, check in on yelp and get an order of shrimp chips for free.  That's the only dish I like there.
4792;Has anyone else gotten old hard rice in their sushi?I ordered an 80 piece platter made this weekend and it was made with day old rice. I am surprised and shocked.
4793;Had the bulgogi and beef udon. In both, the beef was terrible (almost unchewable in the soup). Flavour was bland and unpleasant. Very expensive for bad food. I won't return and I would recommend you avoid it. For sushi in the same neighbourhood try Nama and for Korean there are many to choose from a few blocks south on Bloor.
4794;Usually a big fan but the last time I ordered it took 2 hours to come to my house. Not happy. Stick with dining in.
4795;So, I missed something here...mainly flavor.  I was  really confused because the ratings for this place are solid.  The two guys running the place were nice and seemed to be working their butts off. But I can't get over the fact that my pulled pork burrito with noodles tasted like nothing, absolutely nothing.  I didn't have Mexican or Asian flavors.  I took a bite and had to stare at the burrito to remember what I was eating.  I was disappointed and gave up after the second bite.
4796;Got the "off the hook" which you would think would be fish but it was rib eye steak .. Cool , if only it was rib eye steak . I asked for spicy and it has some kick to it but nothing I would consider spicy .. Plus it had 2 chunks of beef in it so I paid 7 dollars for everything but the protein I asked for .. On the whole very disappointing .
4797;Went back a second time and the black beans were seriously undercooked. They felt like tiny little rocks as I bit into my burrito. There was also excessive sauce, causing the whole burrito to be a drippy, soggy mess and the tortilla to fall apart.
4798;Stopped by this place by chance, hoped for something good seeing the reviews, but it was the same old Toronto Mexican. Tasted like cardboard with cheddar cheese on it. Plastic bags of pre-shredded cheese, chicken was mucky and had no flavour.
4799;I don't understand what the whole rave is about. If burritos were like this nobody would ever eat them. There are so many other places in the city which are much much better! Chipotle or makes much better burritos. So does Burrito Boys and big fat bastard burrito.  Pretty much any other burrito place trumps this hole in the wall.
4800;Very bland. The meat lacks any flavour. Good portion size but I ended up throwing most of it away because it was just awful. Kind of a waste of perfectly good pork. Tastes like its just cooked in water and then they hope thier overly spicy but completely flavourless salsa will cover it up. Avoid.
4801;I tried the new location twice.  First the chicken, bland.  Second the pulled pork, again bland.  I had no clue a burrito could be bland!  What I figure is I always get mild.  Perhaps you have to be a hot and spicy lover to enjoy these burritos.
4802;I went here for the Suya beef and I was so excited, only to receive about six pieces of beef for $11.30.  I had to drive back and ask if I received the correct order! It looked like an appetizer.I bet the wraps and meals may look worth it, but buying the suya beef by itself is definitely a rip-off.  Since the price point is higher than the wrap, I expected more meat!  I have never seen such a paltry amount of meat for $11.30.  I cannot believe it.
4803;This place was surprisingly disappointing. For a place that raves bbq, hence good quality meat. Electric Mudd was a loss. I ordered their cheeseburger for my bf. And brought it back home for it to be of "slider-esque" proportion.  When I spend $10 or more I don't expect to get a junior cheeseburger size from Wendys. All it took was two bites and it was gone. Not to mention it wasnt cooked all the way through. I don't know if it was supposed to be rare or medium rare. But he was not happy!Cheeseburgers are supposed to be cooked all the way through, unless otherwise specified. No one even asked me when I placed the order on the phone. Also, the guy told me 10 minutes. I ended up going there ten minutes later needing to wait an extra 5 to 10 minutes. And the wait was not worth it.All round disappointed! The rating of 1 star out of 5 speaks for itself!We will not be returning.
4804;Service was terrible and the waitress acted like we were a burden. The food was very mediocre. I had the pork ribs and there was barely any meat and the little meat that was on it was dry and gross. I would not recommend.
4805;The food was mediocre at best as far as bbq goes. Not bad, but far from deserving the hype that queen street hipsters give this joint. The incredibly bad service is what really blew my mind. At one point we were asked to move to a different table (because we were only 2) by the door and it was a very cold winter evening. We said no thanks and got a "pshhh" from the server!!  Unbelievable.If you want to overpay for shitty bbq and deal with obnoxious hipster attitude, this is the place for you...but never again for me.
4806;Not impressed with hostesses. Been here two times with empty restaurant. ..always point me to absolute  worst seating when alone.  Treated like royalty when here w with a guy.
4807;Everything here is over rated. Very small portions and not at all a classic bbq spot . A 20$ order of "back ribs" is two bones with a little bit of meat on it. Nice smoked flavour but WAY off the mark on what a quality meal for that price should constitute. I caution anyone that considers this place that there are MUCH better Bbq options in Toronto,like smoque n bones.
4808;The food was not good at all. The price is too expensive and the wait staff were rude. I would not go here again and I would not recommend this place to anyone.
4809;I was here the same night that Charles C was here. Somehow, he rated Nobuya as a 5 star establishment. No way is that possible.Like others have said, Nobuya is ran by a single person. The owner does the cooking, the ordering and the cleaning. On a personal level, I feel bad for the guy. But from a business and a consumer perspective, it REALLY isn't working out for him. For example, during our dinner:1) There were no clean tables. We had to wait for him to clean up a table before we could be seated.2) We never received water during the entire night we were there. 2) We were given cutlery and napkins an hour after we put in our order.3) We ordered at exactly 8:07pm. (We took photos with timestamps) Our ramen arrived at 9:52pm. The restaurant closes at 10pm. 4) We received spicy miso ramen even though we ordered regular soy ramen. I'm sure we didn't mess up the order because we pointed at his menu, which only shows soy ramen. Here's the deal: Nobuya's food is actually not that bad. Their tempura ud
4810;-no water/tea available as one would expect from a japanese establishment-took a REALLY long time to make -service was really homely (touched EVERYTHING-chopsticks/napkins multiple times, chairs and jacket too)-$9.99 tempura soba noodle soup was a soggy mess (deep fried.. celery? and mushed tempura shrimp)-$5.99 karaage and fries were decent (but unsatisfying - i think too much deep fried in one dish - nothing light to offset it?? )-atmosphere/seating was really dingy- i think they are definitely aiming for fast food, as the name implies -- not on par with even food court quality though...- would not recommend
4811;let me start with HOW DOES THIS PLACE HAVE 4+ STARS?. Im new in the area and decided to trust my yelp recommendations and stopped by this restaurant.  When i approached to make an order the owner stated to me that in order to get my meal i need to order a side dish for 6.99+tax. The owner further stated that if i dont order the side dish it may take up to 40 minutes. So i ordered the udon and takoyaki. 1 hour passes by i still haven't received my order, mind you there was only about 4 people in restaurant. I then began to wonder why i paid the extra to get my food quicker and didn't even happen. So finally i get my order. The taste was extremely mediocre im convinced that owner mustve paid customers to make good ratings. So upon finishing my meal being unsatisfying of the service i recieved i decided not to tip the owner. Once exited the owner followed me into the parking lot and proceeded to act aggressive towards me demanding a tip. I kindly advised that tips are earned from service and he did not des
4812;This place is unique for sure.  The wait time is very very long (1 and a half hours) because the owner does everything from cooking to cleaning etc.  It seems drinks were a push to sell on everyone.  I will not ding him on the wait time because it was expected (not that I like waiting that long to eat unless it's free gourmet food).  However the noodle base was so packed with sodium I thought a heart attack would be imminent.  The taste during and after was salt...  pure salt.  In this case perhaps too much soy.  $14+tax for that was way overpriced.  I would have enjoyed packaged noodles more with one tenth the sodium.  Definitely made bloating and discomfort a negative for this place.  Tap water early on would have been a nice offer.  The appetizers are tasty and they come out in decent time.However the push and urge to provide a 5-star review on all outlets as the bill came was a huge buzz kill.  It was as if we had to do that on the spot before leaving the premises.  Another reason to take reviews with a
4813;I really wanted to like this place but it did not measure up. My husband wanted to go based on the high ratings on yelp. I saw Stephanie S review and she's quite accurate...should have avoided this place. The 5/5 rating is a bit surprising...many 1 reviewers though.The food was really just not good. Nobuya...more like nooooo boooooo yah. Japanese food are usually light and fresh but this is very fried and fatty. A lot of it does taste like frozen food. Maybe poor turn over so the food is not very fresh tasting.The fries were the only edible thing. It was nice and crunchy but I think it's quite hard to mess up fried potatoes. The karaage was kind of soggy with all the sauces and it wasn't quality chicken. For 5 pieces, it is a bit expensive. The pork katsu was full of sodium. More breading than there are of pork. I had two bites. I couldn't taste chicken in the chicken skewers...tasted cheap fried dough only.Overall not worth the price tag for horrible Japanese Mickey D's version.
4814;Went there 4/6 and 4/7, 2016, around 6PM.  Both days Nobuya was closed.  I am not sure if this means this place is closed for business permanently, but at least the owner should put up a sign on the store letting customers know when he plans to return and open.   Random closing can happen sometimes due to unforeseen circumstances, but owner should be more responsible.  Time and gas is precious, and business owners who disrespects customer's resources should not be rewarded!!!
4815;after stopping by for lunch with my partner, I am sad to say that I will no longer be returning to this hole in the wall.... literally. I witnessed a baby cockroach on our table that crawled into the wall where the tiles splits and meets the metal. Not to mention I found more shell and a shrimp tail in my wontons..... bye bye
4816;Found a piece of plastic wrap in the boiled noodles. Doesn't seem to be quality. The plastic wrap looks like a condom when you pulled it out of the soup. When confronted the manager about it he act as if nothing happened . Just an exchange.  Do you want to exchange after seeing that?
4817;We visited for late night eats this weekend. It was packed as usual and brusque and efficient was usual. Of 6 of us at table we each ordered something different and did not share dishes. One girl could not stomach the taste of her food and ate only two bites. The rest of us ate normally and paid the price.I was kept awake half the night with stomach cramps. One guy got ballistic diarrhea most of the next day and two others in the group were also ill to their stomachs.I leave you to draw your own conclusions. Swatow? Just say NO!
4818;Would definitely not recommend this place found a bug in the food and they still made me pay for the food worst experience for Chinese food I ever had
4819;I wanted to try the food based on previous Yelp reviews, and I walked in with low expectations on decor and service. I can't remember ever being treated so rudely in a restaurant. The menus were forcefully thrown on the table by a disgruntled employee who quickly walked away. After noticing that it was cash only, I was directed to the ATM which didn't work. An employee then told me to go down the street to the bank in the most dismissive and disrespectful tone you could imagine. I walked out and didn't return. Maybe the food is good, but the place is a dump and the staff can go to hell.
4820;The quality of this place has gone downhill but not the price. Ordered Salt Fish and Diced Chicken Fried Rice - no salt fish at all. How can they cheap out on the most important ingredient?!?!? Not many customers during the height of dinner time on a Saturday...  not surpised at all.
4821;I have eaten at a lot of Chinese restaurants in my day, in New York, London, Los Angeles, as well as Toronto and many other cities. This is by far the worst I've ever had. It wasn't disgusting or anything, it just had no taste. The Chicken with cashews looked and tasted like it had been boiled in water. The "spicy garlic chicken" had no taste whatsoever. The sweet and sour soup tasted like they mixed ketchup and water and put it in the microwave.  The food is pretty pricey too, so I would emphatically urge you to  avoid this place.
4822;Worst experience. EVER. We were blatantly ignored for the first 10 minutes while we stood awkwardly in the middle of the restaurant's floor. When I asked the server behind the bar if we should seat ourselves her response was, "I would prefer if you didn't." Following which she continued to ignore us. A group of three patrons asked what we were doing because we were hovering around their table making their meal uncomfortable, at which point the same server who I had spoken to came over to deliver some food to them, ignored us again and then went on to clear a table (of the wrong size for our group) rather than acknowledging us. There were 2 open tables at the back, which would have been large enough to accommodate our group of 3 - so having been repeatedly ignored and told not to seat ourselves we left. I will be sharing this horrific experience with all of my friends to ensure none of them eat there. Stay posted for the review of the restaurant we wound up at, which acknowledged us.
4823;Once in a while one could be misled by my favorite reviewer Chris Nuttall-Smith. This was one of those times.My wife and I went to Rickshaw Bar, after reading the review published last November. And remembered favorably even at today's Globe and Mail with these words, "Rickshaw Bar, at Queen and Bathurst, where the East African-Pakistani-Southeast Asian cooking, from a talented, young, female Pakistani-Canadian first-time chef and restaurateur, is some of the more exciting food I've tried."We diligently made the reservation and arrived on time. And it was good that we did, otherwise we would have faced the same fate that a very decent group of guests faced (more on this later).The server sat my wife while I was parking my car. It took at least 15 minutes before we could receive a menu or asked if we wanted a drink. Ordered Scallop Puri, and MUNG BEAN CHAAT SALAD as starter and Lychee Lassi and Perrier for drinks. For our "plates" we ordered ISMAILI BEEF CURRY, and CHILI-FISH.Lychee Lassi with a decent
4824;What a disaster. First of all, they charge top-tier restaurant prices and their food is simply not good, either in terms of portion size or taste. For instance, the scallop appetizer I ordered cost $12. It had barely a single scallop shredded into small pieces. At Scaramouche, arguably the best continental restaurant in Toronto, a scallop appetizer cost $25. It has 3 whole scallops, with much better presentation, portion, and flavour. You do the math. I spent $60 and left hungry. The burger priest down the street was much more satisfying at $10. The service was up to par with the quality of the food in terms of incompetence. As soon as we ordered we were informed that the food would arrive at different times otherwise they would be cold. Are you kidding me. It is the kitchen's duty to time so the table's orders are complete at the same time. Do they only have a frying pan in the kitchen? One of our guests ordered the chili fish. As it arrived we were told that there may be small pieces of bone left in fil
4825;I had been wanting to go to the Rickshaw Bar for awhile. So when my friend suggested to go there one Saturday, I was beyond excited. I went in excited and came out very disappointed. I know food is tapas style, but the portion size is so small. The curry was $17 and there was barely any meat. And i wouldn't have actually cared about the portion size, if the food tasted good. Food was bland with unnecessary garnish and cold. Also even though our waiter was nice, it took forever for our food to come out. I understand it was a Saturday night but there's should  not be any reason to wait an hour for appetizers. This is honestly one of worst restaurants I've ever been to. Please save your money and go somewhere else.
4826;Long waits. Was told to wait 20minutes and had to wait an hour. Very unattentive servers, asked for water and server responded yes and ignored us for 15minutes. Food very greasy. Do not recommend.
4827;Horrible service waited to have my order taken when the order taker taking my order, the boss lady told me the line start that way.  There are no sign where line start,the staff is uneducated poorly. Train , my friend who order took for ever, food over price for it size
4828;REALLY GREASY, oily food in small portions. Ordered Thai fried rice with shrimp and got rice with frozen vegetables and about 3 pieces of chicken... for $12. Pad Thai was also greasy with the teensiest bit of chicken in it. The rest of our order was just grease. The cashier also forgot to give us 10% off for pick up. Mall food court food is better.
4829;I wish I could rate 0....we were there this past Saturday for an event. They over booked the rooms, and unfortunately waiting over 90 minutes to get the room which was still very dirty.  Waiters and waitress made the horrible experience better....but the meal was horrible.  Also, the manager forgot to include the vegetarian meal, so 3 people had to watch everyone eat meat while they got a plate of green veggies.  Their meal came out with dessert.  HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE OVERALL...DO NOT GO THERE!!!!
4830;We went there for breakfast this morning (May 01st)..this was our second visit. We ordered a nice breakfast for 2. The Asian Gentleman who runs the place (also the cook) was extremely rude. I asked him for some toast and jam and he was not amused...he said something under his breath and it was nothing pleasent. I usually am not a demanding person, but I had to ask for everything, because the waitress was too busy to refill our coffees...bring us coffee cream etc. The cook would look at me very dirty when I asked to order a few more items on the menu. He made us soo uncomfortable!We finished our breakfast and paid our $30 tab and left. I will probably never ever visit that place again....Advice for the cook/owner:  "I was going to leave you a nice tip, but ur bad attitude prevented me for doing so.....djust because you had a bad day, doesnt mean ruining ur customers nice day"!!!!
4831;I went there reading all the rave reviews mentioned in Yelp. It was a mistake. I didn't realize most of the reviews on here are old. Maybe it was good back then. The couple seemed nice, the place is as described in other reviews. I had ordered double baked eggs. The food was plated well but it arrived very late (the host did apologize for that) though there were not many people in the restaurant. And the food was salty! especially the home style fries. I think it was cooked with bacon grease which some might like but it is not my thing. The eggs were ok and the thick slices of bread was probably the only thing not salty. The cuppuccino was just ok nothing exceptional. 1 star in my books for the food taste.
4832;I came out of my way because of the 5* rating to get some filet mignon steaks. The meat counter had a few other cuts of steaks etc., but no filet. He had some frozen bacon wrapped steaks all of different thicknesses. The man behind the counter was kind enough to put together three of similar thickness, so I took those. Most real butcher shops have enough beef filets to cut the steaks a customer wants. The meat looks like good quality, but don't come here expecting a butcher shop or a butcher.
4833;WARNING: do not use online ordering for this restaurant. It does not work. It took my payment but did not inform the restaurant. When I called irate after an hour the place said 'oh sorry we are having issues with online ordering.' Then he said, 'Get a refund!' Yikes! He said he'd get the order out in 20 minutes and reduced delivery from $6 to $2. Big deal. I like the good here and the concept is innovative but this misleading service is unpardonable. The takeout better be good.
4834;Ordered the $100 omakase for take out. It came with rolls only, not a single piece of sushi or sashimi. The rolls were nothing special either, got a bunch of California rolls, avocado rolls and cucumber rolls (yes they give these cheap rolls for omakase). I think the only roll that was kind of special was the kamikaze roll,   all the other rolls were just rolls you couldve got at any ayce places (actually maybe even worse because there were not any dragon rolls, just plain spicy salmon/tuna rolls).I guess for compensation they gave us like 6 gzoyas for free. But they were like cold leftover ones.The tray we got was not worth the $100 at all and it was no where near omakase. Would never come or order from here again, what a scam.
4835;I used to really like this place and went in on Friday's for many weeks.Then I got FOOD POISONING from a rancid ras malai.The moment I put it in my mouth I realized it was off.  I spit it out immediately.Instead of a sweet milk it was a sour bread-like foam -- sort of like vinegar cheese.I was heaving and spitting out food into their garbage bin for several minutes.The guy at the counter made me pay for the rest of the food, which I could not eat.IMO he should not have charged me anything for making me suffer so much.When I got home my stomach was very upset, with mild food poisoning and I was commission for the day.I won't go back.Also, during the winter they don't seem to turn on the heat.
4836;Not a fan - a little too dingy for me and I really don't mind dingy places.  But the dinginess seemed to have crept into the way they prepare the food and that is just a turn off for me.  I had the chicken burrito and can think of 5 places that I would rather have a burrito at.  Given all the positive reviews on this place, I feel like I am missing something but I don't plan on going back.  Quite forgettable.
4837;Food is sub-par, the service is a fucking joke, and the place is not merely "dingy" (as though that's somehow endearing), but totally unclean. Do not bother unless you want to hang out in a dive with sticky tables and listen to shit music for 20 minutes while you wait for an unintelligible old man to hand you your "burrito". Oh, and since when do "burritos" come with something resembling Caesar dressing mixed with Miracle Whip and sugar water all over them? The beef "satay" (ordered spicy) was bland and gross, and my girlfriend's chicken (ordered medium) was passable but somehow spicier than mine.If you're in a rush and for some fucked-up reason you need to eat on that block, Subway (the shitty chain restaurant) is next door. It's faster and costs about the same and your shirt probably won't stick to the table. (And nobody on Yelp will have falsely led you to believe that you're about to eat a decent meal.) Also, Subway (the chain shithole, not the garbage burrito dive) accepts debit and credit cards.
4838;Not impressed.  The matcha is sweetened, which kills the beauty of the flavour.  The team made an unsweetened version for me, that was unfortunately overpowered by the almond milk.  I tried a matcha cookie, that tasted like macaroni & cheese.  Finally, I tried a chocolate/orange roll cake that was nice.  Brilliant branding and vision here - just a few tweaks needed to serve amazing things
4839;Excited that we have a new coffee place in the hood.  Came in bright and early in the morning to welcome them to the hood.  They were quite indifferent.    No smiles.  Asked for recommendations and got a sigh with an under the breath response of "Matcha Aduki" said he has already said it a million times.  Tried it as I can be too quick to judge. The verdict is in.  London fog was weak.  Matcha Aduki weak.  Bland flavours for both and for the price and service I am going to stick to my regular spot.  So welcome to the neighbourhood and good luck as you will need it
4840;So I decided to go here after seeing that it was a new place that opened up around the area.  Based on the success of most of the west-indie places around the area I thought that it couldn't be bad at all right?When you go inside, you're not really sure what the deal is.  It's half cafe, half bar.  On one end you have a cafe with cakes and cafe tables on the other end you have a stage for a band and a pool table.  Weird.Oh, did I mention that the place is also filthy?  I'm not really a big stickler for a really clean restaurant or sparkling floors but a pair of spring rolls and some napkins underneath my feat is going a bit far.  Maybe that was the appetizer?To give it to them, a 5.99 daily special is pretty enticing, that's what I ordered.  It was a plate of jerk chicken with coleslaw and rice & peas.  It also came with a soft drink of your choice.  It was a pretty good deal in my mind.The chicken was dry and not really flavourful... I'd almost put it on par with chicken from metro that had been sit
4841;Small portions for high cost. I've had canned sauce sold at grocery store that was less watery and more flavourful. The pasta is supposedly handmade but tastes the same as refrigerated pasta from grocery store.
4842;Unfortunately I have never eaten here. Why? Every time I try to enjoy a meal, the wait time for a table is 1.5-2 hours. Tonight was my third and final attempt to visit The Keg. Will not be back.Update: In response to The Keg's reply to my original review: we were told that this location does not accept reservations on Fridays and Saturdays. Thanks anyway.
4843;We've tried going to this restaurant 3 times now and can't get in. Twice were during the week and there is always a long wait. I would gladly sit in the lounge except it's FULL each time. The areas to sit while you wait are full. I told my boyfriend that me standing in heels and a dress to wait 30-40 minutes (we were told) wasn't happening. Sadly, each time we leave.
4844;Read all the great reviews of this place and decided to give it a try. Got take out and ordered 4 dishes (kung pow chk,  dumplings, beef and brocoli,  and chk fried noodles) . We were very disappointed in the quality of the food. The meat did not taste fresh and the other dishes were soggy and not fresh.
4845;I'm always skeptical when I hear that there is discrimination at chinese restaurants towards other asian customers.  But when you actually witness it first hand, it's a wake up call from Life saying "Shits getting real ". I happen to be eating their mediocre dumplings (FYI--spinach & mushrooms=only spinach & BLAND) for lunch when a couple enters followed by a single patron. Both parties were seated by 2 separate servers however both servers were tag teaming the couple by bringing them menus, hot tea and then taking their order. And while all this was happening the poor single patron who was trying to get some service, was totally being ignored. You're probably wondering what's the problem. The couple who entered first should have their order placed first. So what if the single patron is Asian and the couple is interracial (Asian/Caucasian). Do you think there's discrimination? Oh hell yes!  After seeing that I can honestly say my opinion of this establishment is beyond contempt.And btw the dynamic betwe
4846;IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIES, READ THIS.Went to Chinese Dumpling House for lunch yesterday with two friends. We made it especially clear that one of us was vegetarian and very allergic to shrimp, and to please have our vegetable dumpling orders separate from our meat orders.My vegetarian friend who's allergic to shrimp ordered mixed vegetable dumplings but they brought us shrimp & vegetable dumplings instead! That was a terrible mistake as we didn't realise until she already ate one. We called 911 right away, the ambulance came quickly and my friend is okay. However, the restaurant did not apologize once, didn't take action at all, and charged us the entire $50 worth of food we ordered, even though we had just begun our meal and essentially didn't eat any of it--most of it was left on the table when we left. We are really upset at the way they handled it and will never return.
4847;I was utterly disappointed. Trusting my fellow yelper friends the concrete 4 star reviews along with raving fans.... As a Markham Chinese foodie, my expectations for dumplings may be a tad higher than the downtown Caucasians who reviewed this place.We ordered some pretty standard Northern Chinese dishes1) Green onion pancake - it was  a thick chewy dough which resembles a naan bread.. and where's that green onion?2) Dumpings - skin of the dumping was thick and the juice still managed to leak all over. 3) Shredded potatoes - basically just potatoes and carrots in watered down vinegar. Will i come back? Heck no.
4848;I am a yoga fan. I am a fan of OM chant. I am not a fan of this restaurant. I have watched businesses drop away from this spot like flies for last few years until this one. Since it stuck around for longer then most, I figured that it must be good.  uhhh No.Maybe it's me. Maybe we're just not meant to be. Maybe this is what I get for expecting wonderful Indian food from Tibetan restaurant - but I'm allowed to expect that in a city like Toronto, where the Chinese owned sushi spots rule my books - can't I?It could be that the build up was so big and the crash was so hard that I never recovered.I love the cozy atmosphere of this place - it's just dim enough. It's warm colours go well with the cozy feeling and the music. I had my first meal there and I got sick. Maybe it was because I only had a sandwich all day  and the spices didn't like me so much that day  - I dunno. The second time I had the food to go. This in itself was an interesting experience as the waiter refused to give me a specific time as to
4849;TERRIBLE PIZZA. Pasta tasted like a child made it. Service was friendly but slow, and we also encountered this crazy woman patron who got hammered and proceeded to talk everyone's ear off about nonsense. Yikes.
4850;Just plain crap since the place has been sold don't bother.Seems like the food changes with the wind.one day sort of passible the next week doggy do
4851;I feel so alone. My husband loves this pizza. Coworkers have recommended it. Friends rave. It has an average of four stars. My opinion is...WTF?I hate it. Sloppy, greasy, soggy pizza just does not appeal to me. The sauce is good, but that doesn't make up for the slop, grease, and sog. And the bland crust. That's right, I said it.To be fair, (1) I am a crisp, thin-crust kind of gal (2) every single person in the place (besides my husband and small children) is always eating the panzarotti, so maybe that's the true specialty here. Maybe the panzarotti is awesome. And if they served this mound of cheese inside a fried (baked?) pastry in portions smaller than a mailbox, I'd try it.
4852;I live pretty close so I would love this place to be great. Unfortunately I have only been dissapointed in the food. The pizza is generally bland verging on tasteless, slices are greasy and dough undercooked, meat tastes cheap and oily. Panzarotti even more greasy with plenty of cheese and nothing else. Atmosphere is pretty poor. The place is falling apart and you have to wonder about hygiene in a place that looks so run down and dirty.  The signs/menu haven't changed in years and have long since faded. Sorry to say, go to one of the pizza franchises over this place, or anywhere else on College.
4853;After reading the rave reviews, I was excited about bringing our groom and his friends here before his big day.  It was underwhelming to say the least.  No A/C, claustrophobic space, and a rude woman at the register.  Maybe she was just having a bad day.  Either way, after waiting 30 min, the pizza was meh...soggy, ingredients falling off, and a weak crust.    Other this place being a famous relic, I don't really understand the big deal.  I was going to give 2 stars but having folks in our crew who don't eat pork being forced to buy a full pizza bumps this place down to 1 star.  Goodbye Bitondo, I won't be missing you.
4854;This place is great. Takes only debit and cash. The food was great very inventive and yummy. Reason for 1 star: hygiene. The cooks don't practice proper hand washing procedures. Neither does the cashier. She was handling money on minute and taking ice out of a bag with her bare hands the next. I sadly realized all this after I started eating.Bummer, I had high hopes.
4855;I really like the granola! We used to go to Luna pretty often since we live in the neighborhood... Unfortunately we have had one too many bad experiences with the service to return. We usually have the same server who seems to hate people and service. She actually chased my boyfriend down to inform us there is no free refills on drip coffee (dumb policy for a neighborhood breakfast joint) instead of letting it slide, he was forced to leave his topped up coffee behind. It was really awkward. The food is not worth ruining your day over.
4856;Meh.. Food is literally thrown at you and it's all mediocre. Found a couple hairs on the table and in the food and the place overall is pretty filthy.... But... You get to fill your fat face if your into that sort of thing.
4857;Not even worth a star but because yelp requires atleast one hence giving it. My family and I went for dinner on Boxing Day and the food was PATHETIC. My entire family fell sick. Each and everyone vomited the whole night with stomach flu for 3 days until we felt better.Even if you are starving and these guys give you free food please AVOID!!
4858;I went here yesterday, and the food was not as much like what most people talk about here.  There was barely anyone in the restaurant, an the service was very slow,  The sambar we got with our set dosa smelled like it was a month old. When we told the waiter about his, he said, oh ya, and disappeared.  Later he came to us with a bill.   I will never go back here!
4859;This place is over priced and has rude waiters with no customer service. Not recommended at all.
4860;Sorry guys  if you need upset stomach then go here.  Doaa full of baking soda.  Masala was very spicy.
4861;Dnt visit this place worst customer service I ever had in Indian restaurant, a waiter took out order and came after 45 minutes asking to verify order as he forgot to punch in his system also promised us he will give our bill complimentary, but when our bill came there was no discount and we didn't even wait to argue paid our bill and promised will never eat there in life and wont refer anyone to go there.
4862;Pretty pricey and they still nickel and dime you!$2 for tea that other places normally just give you.Ordered  chicken for like $7. It was a pretty small portion and they still serve you the bone in it.Never coming back. Basically it was just the batter that cost me $7 because there was minimal  chicken in it.
4863;The food actually are very good but we don't have a enjoyable experience at zakkushi. The service is so bad!!!! I just don't understand! They only gave us 40mins to eat, one chance to order. and we cooperate to order and eat as quickly as we can! we ordered 3 potato and 3 dessert for 3 PEOPLE, however they only offered 1(the potato and dessert) to us. And then we ask for another 2 dessert they said they can't give us the order( I can clearly remember we still have like 15mins to finish the dinner). I don't understand, it's their mistakes not ours. Anyway, I won't come here next time.
4864;Really Bad expreice there. We have waited  for 1 hour, the server said after 15 mins wait when we come in, after 15 mins they said another 15 mins wait, after 30 mins they said another 15 mins more. There are some table free and nobody wait expected us. We have waited for 1 hours they have any apologize. Really bad service there! Won't go again!
4865;A shawarma shop without shawarma, saying they stopped serving it for the night despite over two hours left before closing.  No wonder it was empty.  I left.
4866;The restaurant was empty when we got there. Order the lamb chops and salmon shish kebab. Didn't like the food at all. We got the salmon to go with rice and the rice tasted burnt. The lamb chops came with mashed potatoes, we didn't like it either. The salmon was ok but the lamb was disappointing. Would not go back.
4867;This is not a 4 star sushi joint. First of all sushi is small and they break apart. One server kept coming to us when we just sat down and kept coming every 1 minute and ask us are you ready, we told her 3 times we need like 5 mins.. i wanted to try this place since it was close by from where we were and it was bad and it's so salty that you don't need soy sauce. Also last not least they charge you a dollar for sauce that's ridiculous and I only wanted spicy mayo. I am not coming back here ever.
4868;Utter disappointment with today's visit. We had a lunch special - #12A and #13. Gross chewy fish. Even the miso soup was flavorless. Blah experience! Sorry, not coming here again.
4869;Came here during lunch due to the rave reviews and high rating on yelp. Maybe I just had bad luck here, but my experience left a really bad taste in my mouth. The salmon was the only thing that was worth eating (good amount of fat), though slightly fishy.Tempura was hard and ice cold.Ordered fatty tuna and the whole piece was sinew. First time I've ever spat out sushi. Uni was not completely fresh but it was edible. $7 for 2 pieces wasn't worth it.$20/person total for the entire meal. Wasn't nearly full. I probably won't ever come back. I recommend Gal's Sushi & Aka-oni (GTA area) and even Mac's sushi over this.
4870;Came here after a quick movie at STC. I don't usually eat in Scarborough but decided that it was close enough and I couldn't really bother driving somewhere else for a late night meal. I can't say I expected much and I only came here mainly because of the yelp rating, but I was pretty disappointed. Two key differentiators in Japanese restaurants are the freshness of ingredients and execution of dishes which both Niji had failed. I ordered a rainbow roll and a bulgogi bento box. The prices were surprisingly not cheap considering the fact that it was half a unit in the corner of a rundown building next to a subway. I've had much better meals for the same price point with much more interesting bento box pairings too.When the bulgogi arrived I felt sad a lumpy old piece of tofu, some shredded pickled radish, ill-formed maki with old salmon, badly positioned thai rice, and chewy bulgogi each filled one section of the box.The rainbow roll used very old sashimi. The rolls were really small too because usually
4871;Ordered  pork bbq skewers at $2.50 each.Take-out.Meat was hard to chew.Flavour was not well entrenched into the meat.Just another restaurant trying to make a living it is not gourmet/chef-material.Nothing wrong with that.Rent is expensive around its vicinity hence  the steep prices of their offerings and NOT at all representative of either the quality or taste of the food being served.
4872;Ate here on Saturday night. Threw up 2 hours later.I've traveled all over South-East Asia and Latin America. When traveling I've gotten sick about twice.
4873;I will start by stating the food is excellent and prices for the restaurant meals are decent. I DO NOT recommend hosting an event here.  The owner LIES! Do not book anything without having everything signed by dennis on paper!His word means nothing with a hand shake.He ripped us off so bad during payment of an engagement party and then did the same at my co workers baby shower.  For the prices per person he ended up MAKING us pay at the end of the events is more then a banquet hall!  we could've gone to one of those facilites for better service.  It's sad I didnt ask for more word of mouth reviews, because from what I'm hearing, it would've been an easier decision
4874;The food may be ok but the service is terrible and because of that, only 1 starwe tried to book a party here and the "party manager" (aka daughter of the owner) was rude, didn't want to accomodate us at all (we want to change one of the entree options, we were told no we wanted to add additional appetizers and PAY FOR THEM for the entire table and we were told no and that if we did that, we couldn't have a set menu for our guests). Her attitude was very "you don't like it, don't have your party here" and I know numerous people who have had the same experience. It's too bad there aren't more greek places in the 905
4875;Considering they peg themselves as a high end mediterranean restaurant, if you removed the white table cloths, the pricey menu and the fancy lighting you would consider it a low end Mr. Greek. We went there on a Saturday night with an 8:15pm reservation. We were seated at 9:30pm because our table's 6 person 5pm reservation wanted to hang around for 4+ hours. The maitre'D, Theresa, tried to express her apologies for the delay, but she didn't see it fitting to tell the 5pm reservation that there was another reservation waiting for the table. She didn't want to be rude, however, making us wait over an hour standing at the front was ok with her. Her reasoning was that they may get blasted over social media. Their accommodation for the wait was to cover the first round of drinks. While we stood waiting for our table, we were bumped and pushed by incoming diners. Even the delivery of centerpieces for the next day's event was pushed through at 9pm amidst that crowd and we stood beside other diners' tables to make ro
4876;One star for excellent food... Other than that service was horrendous.  We had a company xmas party and we had only 2 waiters to serve 60 people.  One was extremely rude too.  If you open up a decent restaurant like such and expect to serve good food only no customer service because you under hired your staff then rethink your objective.
4877;I walked in with my husband at night because I was craving some soup. First thing we were told it's only pick up now because we are closing in 30 minutes!!! I was so appalled by the low graded customer service. I still ordered, I sat, I ate, it was such a rushed and bad tasting experience. I am never going to be returning to ****this location's****** Ravi Soup.
4878;Went over with some friends the other night and we were not happy. Waiters were confused and food and plates were falling all around us. Food was so bad I felt like leaving , very bad when they are busy. Note, go when they are slow because they cant handle the busy times. Like we say in the business, they were in the WEEDS. Waste of 80 dollars.
4879;I have never eaten here but just watched the video someone posted. And I have to ask - why do people in the food industry even bother to wear gloves if they don't use them correctly (i.e. holding the skewer with a gloved hand while handling raw meat with ungloved hand)? That is rhetorical, by the way.
4880;I am Vietnamese who has been eating Pho for all my life and this place is one of the worst Vietnamese-fake restaurants in town. The broth is full of MSG which can make one feel dizzy if he/she is allergic to it. The bbq meat on rice is not really "bbq" but blank as stemmed. Dirty cutlery also. Never come back.
4881;Terrible service.  Nothing like getting yelled at because you finished your meal, asked for your drink which never came and then asked for them to remove it from the bill.Classy
4882;You people that have given this place 4 and 5 stars are crazy.  it was based on these reviews that I took my mother and mother in law for dinner on Mother's Day.I should have had an indication when the place was less than half full on one of the busiest restaurant days of the year.This is one of the most disappointing meals I've had in quite some time and I was embarrassed that I took the mom's here for a special day.  Before we get to the food, wine is by the bottle only so I couldn't get a glass of wine.  Thank goodness as they do not have glasses!  That's right, only plastic cups.  Also, the plates are stryrofoam and plastic forks (no knives or spoons plastic or otherwise).  We ordered King Crab, Lobster and Shrimp.  While the crab was nice in the lime pepper sauce it was almost impossible to get out of the shell with plastic forks and no metal skewers.  The Lobster was tiny and the shrimp was previously frozen, and flavourless.  All of the meals were served plopped on the table in plastic bags.  WTF!Ev
4883;The service wasn't the greatest and the food was okay,  I would probably not come back every again. The captain's boil is opening right next door. They have better service then this place. Plus they don't steal some of your food before serving it to you or, forget to give you change
4884;Dishes are alright but definitely just mediocre. I am surprise the restaurant has such a high rating. That was what led me to try it in the first place. If you are interested to get seafood in a bag, captain's boil or even good catch is a much better option. The lobster mac and cheese was not good. The crust / outer shell of the mac and cheese was just hard. The lobster fries was good, but definitely not worth $28. Bagged seafood was not that fresh. Everything was very pictured friendly but the meal was just not worth. For the same price I rather go to other similar restaurants in the market. Again, the restaurant was not that bad, but the rating definitely did not match up to what I ate.
4885;The food here is mediocre compared to its competitors, like The Captain's Boil, and the service was laughable (I'll get to that in a second). We ordered mussels with Cajun sauce and Triple Claw poutine. The Cajun sauce was watered down. The seafood in the Triple Claw poutine was overly chewy and salty. So the food was a miss for us.Our waiter took forever to take our order after giving us our waters. I don't know what he was doing, other than socializing with the other waiters and scaring one of the waitresses while she was cleaning the table next to ours. We attributed that to perhaps, the playfulness/culture of the restaurant, when an airhorn went off. Yes, an airhorn, which made half of us in the restaurant jump out of our seats, a girl to scream, and an infant to start crying. There was a celebration a couple of tables away from us. I thought that it was a customer setting off an airhorn, which would've not been the fault of the restaurant. But lo and behold, it was my waiter who blew the airhorn, not
4886;Apparently, you can't rate no stars.  SlimyGreyMSG soakedFood.Unless you have thrill-seeking issues (BASE jumping is somewhat less risky than eating here), don't eat here,
4887;Let me start off by saying that I would give them 0 star. my order at this restaurant is pretty clear: Veggie Pizza. I remember back in the day their pizza was not bad compare to other Persian pizza places. but the past four times that i ordered made me come here and leave a review. 1- nothing on the pizza was fresh except tomato slices which they couldn't avoid using fresh ones.2- I specifically ask for no onion and the last time had tons on it. 3- the dough wasn't baked properly since the toppings were about to burn. (remember all toppings come right out of cans)4- we got there to pick up the pizza and the cashier was clearly avoiding us doing something else even though the pizza was right infront of us to be paid for.I hope the owner gets my review and bring a more upscale attitude into his/her business.
4888;Waited 30 minutes for two pupusas and 40 minutes for ceviche and yuca con chicharon, the yuca and chicharon was probably fried with old oil.  I finished my meal before my wife got her seviche with yuca and chicharon. Never going back.
4889;We were for happy hour. I came here and sitting at the table waiting for my friend. But during the first 20 mins , no one came to say anything to me. No water, no menu, no anything. And finally, the waitress shows up. I feel like she is not friendly. She never smiles. And when I say Hi to her, she didn't reply me. Maybe because we only ordered the 1 buck oysters? After finishing the food and waiting for another 20 mins. I have to go to the front desk and tell the waitress that I want to pay my bill, because she didn't come to check us. I gave her 15% tips, but her service doesn't deserve it. And some of the oysters are VERY tiny. Won't come back again. There are many other buck a shuck oyster deals in town.
4890;Avoid! Based on my experience, both the service and the food are subpar.Service was slow. The waitress did not smile even once. She also interrupted our service several times to go pour wine for several gentlemen at the next table, who were either regulars or more eligible for service as they were wearing suits... Wow!I went to The Shore Club with two friends. They both ordered the lobster bisque, which was too salty. I ordered a calamari, which was again too salty. It also tasted more like fried breaded mix than squid. As of my main dish, I ordered a grilled ahi tuna. I asked for it to be rare, which any decent chef would already know to prepare rare. The ahi tuna steak came fully cooked, at what I would describe as well done. There could be three reasons for this. 1. They do not follow the customer's directions on how to prepare the food. 2. The cut of tuna was not fresh and they were afraid I would get sick if it was served rare. Or 3. They don't know that tuna steak is not usually prepared fullycooke
4891;Mediocre at best... the chef is in love with mayo and oilDuo Tatar tasted old and too oily...Beer salad was a Caesar salad with a few beers on top and whole lot of mayo!!!Greasy "feature fish" which was a tasteless Char and lots and lots of oil... fish taste old... and the cheese cake I was hoping to add a sweat ending to it all was also old...And it's only Tuesday! Service was not great... It's a diners experience with a facade of a posh restaurant and prices that don't worth at all.There are many other options nearby that would be a much better experience.Absolute disappointment!
4892;My boyfriend and I have been doing more take out recently and with our latest sushi craving, we ended up ordering from Ume Fashion Sushi. Looking at the Yelp reviews, we figured it would be a decent place to get food from as the ratings were fairly high. However we were wrong.Upon scanning the menu, it seemed decent. Prices were a bit high but we figured it would still be cheaper than dining-out. We made a $50 purchase which included 5 rolls and a beef teriyaki bento box.The beef teriyaki bento box was $16.95 so we figured there would be quite a bit of food. However, we got about 7 small strips of beef drenched in sauce. The beef was chewy and difficult to eat. The amount of rice was unimpressive and the miso soup was grainy and unpleasing. The bento included 5 pieces of sushi (3 salmon and 2 shrimp) and a 4-piece California roll. The sushi was quite small and the salmon was cut really thin. It was nothing special. I don't like California rolls as I'm a fan of raw fish so I don't want to give a bias revie
4893;Not my favorite... I am not a fan of the food. Sushi wasn't very fresh. I am not a fan, sorry.Service was great tho. I'll rate the service five stars.
4894;I went to this place for a work party and at first it seemed appealing. Until my first order. I decide to go ala carte. Big mistake. I ask if the sushi ala carte is for 1 piece or two. The server checks and says for 2 pieces. Not bad close to 5-6 dollars per order. So I order up all the sushi I desired. Later on I'm then told that its actually 1 piece per order. Really? That should have been enough for me to say forget it. How can you not know? So my 10 pieces is going to run me up to 60-70 dollars??? Wow I can't express to you how upsetting that is. I could have gone to a slew of places and have gotten much higher quality sushi for more at that dollar. Unfortunately a coworker loves this place and since I'm among people I opt to not make a scene and accept. Then the server tells me the uni sushi I ordered would be better as a shot, so she recommends me to do an uni shot instead. Who am I to reject a recommendation from the chef? So I agree. A few minutes later I'm told the don't have the fresh scallop so the
4895;my bf and i decided to check this out as we were looking for a place to go out on a friday.  needless to say, it was a disappointment.  food was not good quality compared to other places for sushi/sashimi especially for the price.  you can definitely find much better quality for the price if you travel 10 more minutes west.  especially for raw fish - i'd rather travel further or pay more for good sushi/sashimi.
4896;If I could give 0.5 or 0 stars I would.First of all, the place is not really a Japanese place. You know from the furniture, decoration and the music they place. It is a Chinese restaurant that also serves some sushi and Thai menu. I think Toronto and Etobicoke now has abundance of international cuisine that is AUTHENTIC. I'm surprised this place has decent reviews - maybe the other clients have not tried real sushi in the area.The sushi and rolls Conmbo for lunch was TERRIBLE with dried rice. Specially The roll was so roughly done. The sushi nigiri has fish that was till frozen. The miso soup comes in a tiny dish that they use to HOLD the Chinese spoons. The salad that comes with the lunch combo is full of withered vegetables that I did not touch.The tempura was Yellow with very low quality vegetable.The ginger is full of some chemical taste, didn't touch.If you have any experience eating sushi you will agree with this review but hopefully I have just saved you from wasting money and having a bad ta
4897;I have both eaten here and had delivery on a number of occasions.  There quality and service has declined significantly.  After having waited over an hour and a half for delivery service the food we got was terrible.  The peas in the rice were rock hard either not cooked properly or severely freezer burnt.  There sushi was not rolled properly and literally almost each piece fell apart.  The delivery person explained it was busy which I understand but that is no excuse for poor quality.
4898;My worst sushi meal ever.The first visit was edible, with nice service, but the 2nd visit was the worst spent $ on any food in my life. Me and my partner and the other couple tables that were there left with discarded food. There was a person cooking who didn't seem to be a chef more like a random cook. The combo rolls I ordered had no fish in it, the rice was also poor, my partners sashimi was bland and old tasting. The Special rolls and the sauces they smear all over everything and cooking their Sushi was very horrible. Nothing tastes Japanese. We left after not eating the entire day agreeing it was one of our worst meals ever.Will never go back, doesn't matter how nice you are, if your going to serve that and charge for it $ stay closed that day that's the nicer thing to do.
4899;Whew, I'm totally backed up on reviews but this place just became first on my list! Whoever reviewed this place and gave 5 stars obviously is friends with the owner or worker because this place is a straight up SHAM! - Valentine's reservation for 9pm (I know my man planned a late dinner lol) - we arrived at 8:55pm and the maitre de said it would be a 5 minute wait (although there was 4 couples ahead?) - decided to sit at the bar and grab drinks before would be seated... One drink became 3 drinks... 5 minutes became 15 more minutes and tables are empty yet we're still sitting at the bar?- as soon as we noticed it was 10:30pm (still seated at the bar) we were like "whaaaatttt the hell" so we ask to speak to the manager- the bartender points at this man and says "you see that man that's leaving? He's the manager" WOW - so we ordered our food received the appetizers at a reasonable amount of time but the entrees 1 hour tops. - it's hitting 11:51pm and the manager comes to our table and makes a complet
4900;Maybe it was a bad idea to come on valentines but I wouldn't expect to wait 2 hours or more for food anywhere even on a day like today.We made a reservation at 8 and got seated fairly quickly. The place was not packed but it wasn't empty either. We waited 15 minutes to get the menu and another 30 minutes to place our order. We even had to wait another 15 minutes for water...everything was completely disorganized!! It's funny because I've been here since 8 pm and I'm typing this all out as I'm still waiting for my food... It's 10:25pm. We ordered a Caesar salad, lamb rack, Ontario rib eye and the maple bacon Brussels sprouts. Literally still waiting.. We would've walked out already but who I believe to be the manager said he would cover our tab 40 minutes ago. Here we are still waiting what a nice valentine. We asked the server multiple times to check on our food every time he said a couple minutes. This is a review basically on the horrible service because I have yet to receive my food... VERY VERY DISORGANI
4901;If you think the food is delicious, it has a secret ingredient. AND THAT IS THE CHEFs SALIVA!!!. Omg, are you kidding, I watched them make their dishes during busy time. They dont even try to hide it.The owner or whoever the chef is, uses his hand to taste the cooking dish, licks it from his palm, wooden spoon that he uses to cook, puts that back in the dish. Then repeats this process a few times to test the taste. Comes back to the front for cash register, goes back without washing the hand and does this again.Are you serious? Basically there is saliva in all the dishes he cooks. Disgusting!! I guess you didnt want to know about this while enjoying your deliciou saag paneer, or chicken tikka masala with saliva. ewwwww!!!Never going here again. And I walked out right after and bought the jerk chicken right next door to this place, hoping the big Jamaican woman didnt do the same. Isnt this a health code violation? Pappi from Seinfeld anyone??
4902;I'm actually convinced that every positive review on yelp is by someone who works at Glory of India, because if you're looking for authentic Indian cuisine and roti, this is probably the last place you should go. The butter chicken sauce comes out of a jar, guaranteed. The curry sauce is far too oily, and separates in between bites. These are just not good dishes. I grew up with Indian and Pakistani friends, whose families often invited me for homemade dinners. I have gone to just about every descent Indian restaurant in the GTA with these same friends. This is far and away the worst I've ever had, and the only reason I tried it in the first place was because I accidentally ordered from this place and not another restaurant in the immediate area, which is the realest joint in the block.
4903;By far, the most unprofessional place as far as restaurants go!Decided to have food from here this evening. Went online to see if we needed to order for pick up or delivery and the website seemed unclear on whether they were going to deliver or not even inspite of asking for a buzzer # in the order form.We called the restaurant over 12 times only to get an an answering machine! Guess that should've been our cue.We placed the order and received an email saying the order will be available for pick up! So we start getting ready and jump in the car to get the order only to find the place..you ready...CLOSED!Their website, Facebook page & Yelp showed it as being open!Thank god for the diversity in this city as we were able to order from another place right away and pick it up!Terrible experience! @Yelp - Please work on updating the info.Never again!!
4904;$19 for mango drink and butter chicken wrap?Stomach felt uneasy, much better roti/curry around.  Counter staff friendly. Interior clean, too expensive for mediocre meal.
4905;I went to this place based on the 4-star Yelp review, which is usually a pretty good indicator of the quality of the restaurant, but I have to say Yelp, you let me down this time.We approached the restaurant and saw a sizeable crowd waiting outside. We were a party of two, and went in to put our names on the list. One of the servers told us it would be a 20 minute wait. We wrote our names down, wrote our cellphone number in the "Cell Phone" column on the list, and went for a coffee down the street. We came back 20 minutes later, and proceeded to wait a full hour to hour and fifteen minutes more. Now, I know the server doesn't total control over wait times, especially since there was a table of two that stayed for at least 20 minutes after they had received their bill, but given that we waited almost 3-4x longer than she originally estimated, we were pretty frustrated, especially since we would have gone somewhere else had we known it would take this long. As we waited for the people at the table table of 
4906;I really wanted to like this place. I was super excited to try all the delicious sugary brunch foods I saw on the website. But after my experience I will not be returning. Our main server was very curt with us, missed some orders and spilled boiling water on my lap blaming the "over filled tea kettle", the apology was nice but I wished she had run over a towel or some more napkins without having to be prompted. Our group was excited for the food but only my friend who order the beef bacon hash was satisfied. My other friend who ordered the sausages did not like them and found the little sausage medallions very rubbery. My French toast was very soupy, the bread had almost dissolved into the syrup before I could finish it. I had one soggy slice left over and the server said she would pack it up for me. But she never returned (which was fine by me). I think I would be willing to return if it was only a food issue (maybe the kitchen was having an off day - it happens to us all) but the server was so short with us
4907;The place is nice, good atmosphere, service however was not great. I took my old school love out to dined. I ordered appetizer and entrees and the server did not offer me the option of if the appetizers get served first or together with the entree. Upon ordering my drink, the server was not very friendly, in fact, she was very rushed in taking the order. Food is OK, I was referred to this place by a friend who claimed that this place has the "best grilled cheese", I would like to confirm that this statement is a myth (false). As for the grill cheese, the bread was way too think, and I would preferred it to be more toasted, as the cheese did not melt. In the conclusion, the place is good if you want to impress your sweetheart by taking her to a place that has good atmosphere and looks nice however, if you are a food lover... stay away... I will not be returning... peace.
4908;Firstly I should say I've been here before and the food is good. However on our last visit we were disappointed as we waited to be seated for almost 10 minutes - not normally a problem, I'm happy to wait for good food -  but we were not acknowledged by a single staff member for the whole duration of this wait, not even a hello. We were not the only people in line and there seemed to be a lot of staff members standing around. There were also empty tables.After being ignored for almost 10 minutes we decided it was best to leave.Not sure what the problem was but it was a pretty terrible experience, especially for 2 hungry people!
4909;I am perplexed by the glowing reviews. Perhaps it's the Yelpers that have set them up for this downfall. I would be incline give them an extra star or two had it not been for the glowing reviews. Anyhow, let's get into it and this one will be a short one.The chicken is tender yet is void of juices somehow. It's almost reminiscent of meat that's been heavily tenderized with some kind of tenderizer or has been stewing for way too long. The flavours are bland at best and I definitely do not taste much of the exotic spices from the middle east. The salad is regrettable with so much onions in it. I like onions but not a huge fan of onion salads. The dressing? Where is the dressing? There you have it. That about sums it up. I wouldn't necessarily avoid this place if you are already here and starving but I think there are better places to dine in this area for sure.
4910;My experience was, in a word, disappointing.I recently moved to the area, and wanted to try something new, so I suggested that we try out Dave's for lunch this past Sunday. I had consulted the menu on the website in advance and everything looked ok. Even prior to walking into the restaurant, it was noted that the menu's were posted on the wall. I received clearance from everyone in my party before entering. As soon as I opened the door, I noticed that the place was largely empty, which in my books usually raises an eyebrow. We were promptly greeted by the sole waitress in the restaurant and sat at the large table by the window. Rather than being handed the menus that were posted on the wall, we were handed brunch menus that were rather limited in scope. We asked if we could still order off of the lunch menu, and were quickly denied with a swift, 'I'm sorry, but it's only the brunch menu from 11am-3pm". Out of the 6 items listed, 4 had pork products included. Not being one much for the other white meat i
4911;Worst Chinese eve saw so much good comments about this place and was such a disappointment never again
4912;Being the huge foodie I'm, I have been a faithful user of Yelp for years now. I thought maybe in the new year instead of only using yelp it's also time for me to give back.For those who might not want to read my long review I will summarize it. I got food poisoning from not very tasty and smelly steak. Customer service was sub-par. Now let me get into my real thoughts and experience of the restaurant. It sadden me that my first review was about a such a horrible experience at Octagon. Me and 5 other friends decided to have a triple date there to celebrate the new year. We had a private room, the atmosphere was very antique like. All the server are older well dressed gentlemen reminds me of Barbarian Steak House downtown. But their service wasn't close to the same. Most of the time they were very confused on who ordered what. So they will bring plates of food just stand there and stare their paper and confirm orders. When I asked for gravy for my mash potato the server looked at me with the condescended loo
4913;This place is only popular by its name Nd maybe it looks fancy but the food not the beat i can get a better quality of steak in a decent steak house. I and my bf went there last Wednesday for dinner and didn't have a good exprience at all and its just overpriced and the portions are way too small for what you pay for.
4914;We visited last Saturday night.  I have wanted to come here since I was a kid, always found the building to be intriguing.  Complimentary valet parking was nice, and the interior of the restaurant is really cool.  It's so old school, but remarkable with the carved wood and stained glass everywhere.  The lights were too bright though.  Reminded me of a well lit cafeteria.  The service was OK.  It was weird how they were either all over us (rushing us, at certain points) or they were completely...gone.  The service, after we received our mains, was all of a sudden realllllly slow.   And then it became unbearably hot in there.  It wasn't just me, all four of us were actually sweating.  It just got hotter and hotter...I liked the relish tray.  The bread was really delicious and the pickles were nice and sharp.  I was insulted by the price of the caesar salad, so I didn't order it.  The profit margin on a caesar salad is already ridiculous, but they think they can charge $17.95 a person?  For lettuce, egg, par
4915;Hardly worth it. the steaks are less than average and the service is poor (we ordered french onion soup which never came, and they mixed up a medium rare order with a rare one).  Overall, one of the worst dining experiences I've ever been to and thoroughly disappointing considering that they have built up a reputation of being one of the best steakhouses in toronto
4916;Heard a lot about this Steakhouse and we knew it wasn't cheap either... never the less, we decided to go there yesterday to celebrate my birthday. The service at first was nice, and then as we were about to finish our food, not quite finished, they already started pushing us to finish and started taking all our plates away, we had to literally tell them "we are still working on this..." So as they stopped taking our plates away, and they immediately handed us the bill... we weren't even done eating! for God's sake... after handing us the bill, they came to the table every 30 seconds to see if we are ready to pay... my wife had to tell the waiter "please don't check on the bill for at least 20 min... we are not done yet."I'm assuming it was because our daughter started crying and it was bothering them. Still, it was very very rude! So I wouldnt plan on this place if you have kids...From the food point of view, and only from the food point of view, I had the Bone in Rib Steak which costs $65.95CAD, the steak
4917;Great decor.  Horrible service. Scallop was good, but one of four didn't have bacon wrapped.  Server THREW DOWN the steak and ran away from our table. Never asked once how thing were. Steak was bland and only warm-ish.   Mash potato tasted like cotton.  I'm not a picky guy normally, but this place really disappointed.  Sad because the decor really is epic.   But this place is probably the worst high end steak house I've ever been to!!!
4918;Very disappointed. I have driven past this restaurant since I was a child, so decided to celebrate my 40th birthday there. I made a reservation for 15 people, so they gave us a private room on the second floor.First issue: no elevator. My 70 and 73 year old mom and dad had to hobble up this steep narrow staircase, with their canes...you would think with the renos after the major fire, they would add a small elevator. Second issue: for those that had pop, the waiter would come by and offer another. ..never telling us that there is a charge for each small glass of fountain pop... $30 on pop after a bill of $1,000...seriously?!Third issue: the steaks were cold, but my friends and family were too polite to complain because they didn't want to ruin my night. I ordered the filet mignon that comes topped with mushrooms...there were two undercooked mushrooms thrown on the plate. The side garlic mash tasted like it came out of a box.Word of advice. ..go to the Keg, the food is hands down much better, and a fractio
4919;The seafood linguine pasta is super salty to the point that its unedible.  For the price you pay, you expect it to be good.
4920;I been here twice in the past month and the service has been exceptionally slow. The pricing is rather high for service quality.  The  meals were OK but it took forever to get them. I would definitely not recommend this restaurant for any sort of business meeting or dinner as it will not be an efficient experience
4921;I had dinner there last evening celebrating my girlfriend's birthday. After we were seated, I got up to use the restroom, and had discreetly ordered 2 Kir Royale's from the hostess, to please bring them to the table. Came back from the restroom and the first thing our server said was, "so you ordered 2 Kir Royale's right?". I thought this was in poor taste as I had purposely pulled the hostess aside, and whispered to bring the drinks. The rest of the evening went well, as the food was very good. Upon receiving the cheque, I was shocked to see the price of the Kir Royales were $24.95 each. Never in my life have I ever paid that price for this drink. It just left a bad taste in my mouth, and I could not justify such an outlandish price for Cassis and Prosecco. The prices on the menu are high, but the food is very good, but $25 for a mixed drink is preposterous. THIS price cannot be justified. We will not be returning to Via Allegro.
4922;As far as pizzerias go, this was an extreme disappointment. Service was incredibly slow and the pizza was so soggy it might as well have been soup. Besides that, the pizza was also nearly flavourless and cold when it was served to us. And can we say rubbery cheese? What about prosciutto saltier than the ocean? It goes without saying that I will not be returning.
4923;I went to the food truck. Absolutely terrible. I ordered the burrito bowl. It was cold and used ingredients from a can. Given the extensive amount of Mexican cuisine in Toronto, don't waste your time here. Even Mucho Burrito is better.
4924;This sushi place is in a Chinese strip mall. The quality is sub par and the staff was not very nice. We asked for extra plastic forks and chopsticks because we were sharing the food at the mall but the owners asked lots of questions about why we need that many chopsticks e.t.c. How else are we eating your sushi if we don't have them? *rolls eyes*
4925;I've been to the Collingwood location 3 times and LOVED every minute of it. Naturally, hearing the news of a new Vaughan location, I was more than excited to go. Unfortunately, we went, it was unbelievably disapointing. To start, our table and the 5 or 6 bottles of sauce on the table were ridden with little flies. I didn't think there were flies in November, but there were, so many that we had to move to the other side of the restaurant. Anywhere else, I likely would have left. However, I was so excited for the food. Even bigger disapointment. Tried the bacon weaved loaf of meat, which, to more accurately describe it, was a slice or two of the overall loaf, which tasted more like a giant coldcut. The tiny portion of sweet potato fries were cold and rather old looking as well. To add to the lovely experience, our overpriced little cup of Mac and cheese was a 4/10 at best. The beans, maybe a 3 or 4/10. The burnt ends were also cold and full of fat. Very disappointing overall. Believe me when I say, I'm a major 
4926;Looking for something at lunch time close to home.  This is brand new place and never been to this chain before.  We went in and were the only customers inside.  The staff was sitting at a table in the corner playing on their cell phones.  (seriously)Server seated us with menus and returned in 3 minutes to take orders with pen and pad in hand.  Made zero introductions or suggestions. She didn't ask if we'd been to a SmokeBBQ before.  I was still dazed from the high prices of simple items like a BLT sandwich,  or to add chicken to a salad is extra $8.  Wow!  I picked an appetizer chicken wings, and my friend got a side dish of macaroni&cheese.  Both were disappointing.  Came to table with simply 8 wings on a dish, looked like it just came out of   a microwave.  Not even a carrot, or a sprig of parsley for presentation.  The pasta that cost $8.00 was served in a small ramekin dish like a dessert,and was over cooked penne pasta. We only had water and the bill came to $23.  I won't go back ever, and regret th
4927;This used to be my Jerk chicken go to spot in scarborough about 5-6 years ago. The quality has gone down significantly. Just ordered today My jerk chicken was too salty with lack of spices. And the girl who took my order was short as if i owed her somethhing when i tried to clarify my order. $9.50 for jerk chicken & rice & peas?... There are better places in the city.
4928;The only WAVE we experienced was our stomach's turning all the way home after we left.. If you want this food, order ahead for pick up, it's slow and interior is ugly. The jerk chicken was POOR, bad rice/peas, terrible gravy. Curry chicken decent. Average prices, both felt 'off' afterwards (unhealthy).
4929;Poor customer service.  Pre-ordered & went to pick up 30 minutes later to be told that my order was not processed! WTF?! Also they have audacity to place a sign asking that you do Not use your mobile phone while ordering yet I had to wait over 15 minutes for 1 client to place her order & chat with the waitress... The pepper shrimp was delicious.
4930;I have eaten at Caribbean Wave a bunch of times an the food has always been good. But today the food was just gross. The Caribbean Wave rice we ordered was stale an cold. We had to send it back. The veggies we ordered tasted disgusting and was swimming in a pool of corn starch liquid. We drove all the way to Scarborough to eat at this restaurant today an needless to say it was a great waste of time.
4931;Ordered the chicken and got home to find what looked like chicken scraps with hardly any edible meat on them. Everything was dry and crispy like it was scavenged from the garbage.
4932;Worst customer service I ever experienced since I moved to canada. The short asian lady clearly needs to learn how to interact with customers. I arrived around 10:15 pm when the lady informed me that the "west Indian" side of the restaurant was closed. Not sure how I was suppose to decipher that there was a West Indian side and a Chinese side from the name of the restaurant. It seemed she was already annoyed at the gods before I arrive because her attitude was atrocious! I sat by the bar and watched as she continued to serve other patrons for 15mins before me and my partner decided to leave. A  male employee seemed willing at one point to assist me but was definitely too busy to take my order. Honestly if Ritz didn't close at 10pm I wouldn't have even known that this place existed. My first and last time going to that restaurant and I will surely share my experience on other social media platforms. Brief recap.1. Poor customer service.2. Unwelcoming atmosphere 3. Lack of staff 4. Will not be returning
4933;This place has gone down since new owners have taken over. The seem not be able to understand simple instructions.  When  you call in and they tell you it will be ready in 20 minutes and I show up 40 minutes later they have not even started my food. When ppl call ahead of time it is because they are in a hurry and don't want to wait!
4934;This place has no idea how to run a business! After placing an order with them through skip the dishes, they first contacted me directly telling me they were out of a dish I ordered. I agreed to replace the item with something else in order to avoid a hassle. They said I could replace it with something I already had in my order. I ordered a kabob dish with 3 skewers (ground beef, lamb chops and chicken) and they were willing to replace it with either a separate ground beef dish or a chicken one. I told them I would like one of the sirloin dishes ($3 difference), as I already had chicken and ground beef in my initial order. They made it a hassle by calling skip the dishes and having them call me to charge my card an extra $3! I called the restaurant back to complain about their poor customer service, reminding them that I grew up in a family who has been in the customer service industry my entire life. They then said that they refuse to deliver here and told me I would have to pick up the food myself if I wan
4935;Well. I did come here and had to leave because it had no tables to eat on.. our house is far and we didnt want it eat food in the car so i didnt order anything. I google best jerk chicken in Scarborough and this place came up so i wanted  to try this with my wife.
4936;Very disappointing. Had friends from out of town. Decided to go to station pizza for good food and service. It's a small place so we called ahead to let them know our party of six was coming. We called at 610 to no avail. We showed up at 630. We were served at 820.  Food was ok. Not worth the wait.
4937;very bad service and food. they didn't allow you to change to something else when you told them the food had weird taste, force you to kept it.
4938;This was a terrible place even though this was a Hong Kong style cafe which had great food at low prices. Though the great food was a big disappointment! Everything was overly salty and not worth the time or effort to go there. I would definitely skip this place and go to the mall which has a food court or the restaurant on the right, blue ocean
4939;Since all the restaurant is packed so I came back since there was no waiting here. I ordered the baked fish with cheese macaroni. I started to eat half of it I realized there was more fish skin then fish meat. The only reason I didn't know at first is because the fish was fried first which I don't even like it. The fish was chewy and sauce was salty. The Russian botch soup has minimal taste too. This will be my last time here!
4940;I used to be a loyal customer to this restaurant for years until one day I found a used band-aid in my soup and noodles. I was completely disgusted and we confronted the waitress who then went to the kitchen to find out and you know what... She came back and told us one of the chefs admitted to losing a band-aid and wasn't sure where he lost it!!! Disgusting!
4941;I truly don't understand the hype around the places, it's crowded, slow and poor service and the food is very mediocre. I think the only reason they keep busy is because of the lack of HK tea choices in the area
4942;下午茶炸脾餐，竟然夠膽用已煮好不知多久的雞脾去炸...叫餐後不到十分鐘雞脾已到，已經心知不妙...因為如果是生炸的雞脾，絕對不可能短時間做好。雞脾有陣鹽水烚雞味，估計是用海南雞餐的雞脾炸出來的...雞脾乾無可乾，外面的一層肉炸得死死硬，跟本無法吃下去。這個$6.5(改沙律多$0.5)的餐，還不如隨便一個food court的水準。失望程度令我不敢再去試其他食品...
4943;stood at the door for 5 minutes. 3 of the workers saw me walk in but no one approached me to greet or ask how many people. I continued to wait. Soon a middle aged chinese lady buds in and the waitress gives her a number. The service here was so bad that I didn't even bother to wait to try their food. Saving my money to take my business elsewhere.
4944;If you have good taste, you will not like this place. However, if you are the average citizen, you definitely might. The service was less than stellar (especially with out server). We were not appropriately greeted, checked on, etc. The food was subpar. The caesar salad had old lettuce, with pieces that were browning. My mom's shrimp linguini was sour. I could go on, but I will just finish this off by stating that I would not return.
4945;Frozen seafood, chewy steak, greasy pizza. Pass!
4946;I don't know what that guy is talking about but I've tried several times to eat here and it's always shut down. This page should've been removed a long time ago.
4947;Place is over rated beyond imagination. The samosas are small and super expensive for the price. For the price of 12 samosas, I could have bought 60 or at least 36 elsewhere with a lot more flavor. Bought 30 samosas....all vegetarian. While packing 1 fell off and they had the cheek to add a meat samosa in a pack that was right at the bottom. No more samosas from this place for sure.
4948;Picked up 10pcs mixed samosas earlier today for just over $10.  I do not get the raving reviews these samosas get on yelp.  I've had many, many samosas and can't say I enjoyed these at all.  There is too much crust vs filling, and they are very oily.  I peeled a layer off the phyllo-like crust, it was drenched with oil in between. The fillings were on the dry side, and I found there was little distinctiveness between the different flavours, perhaps due to the overwhelmingly greasy aftertaste.  I will not be returning - high price, low quality.  Edit - adjusted to 1 star, it was just awful.
4949;I've read many great reviews so decided to try these samosa's. I'm east Indian and these samosa's are far from the real deal! Don't recommend it whatsoever and they overpriced! Samosa's from Indian sweet shops are usually are  2 for $1 and they authentic. I'm really embarassed that this place claims to say these are samosa's when there not! The main ingredients (spices) are missing. Not the taste of a real samosa!
4950;This place was great........12 years ago ! Now, I stay far away from this crap hole. Oily, no taste, hole-in-the-ground barn with a new staff. Last time I ate something from there, I ordered out from another restaurant right after trying to consume the Sultan's schmuzz. Last place I'd ever try again if all other eateries suddenly vanished. Too bad we can't give this place No Stars.
4951;So after ordering and paying, I was told they are out of the veggie slice I purchased. So opt for the deluxe. Not quite sure what they did but the pizza was doughy and gummy especially for a thin crust pizza. Ranks near the bottom for any pizza I've ever eaten.
4952;I amazed as to how this place is rated so highly. After looking up Yelp reviews and been close to where we live, wifey and I decided to try this place. The food is mediocre at best. Have had way better pizza and pasta at a fraction of the price. Ordered the 'Shinny' pizza (wild mushrroms) and this was a disaster, soggy, could see water on the pie, mushrooms were not fresh seemed like they used canned mushrooms. Wife ordered pasta al forno, no flavours at all its like eating raw tomato sauce. We hardly had two bites and had to waste the entire dish. Still don't why this place is rated so highly. Anyways this is my 2 cents on this place.
4953;Could not try any pizza, reservation needed on sat night, 1.30 min wait time. Glad we dint waste our time waiting for a table. We found another pizza place down the street
4954;Never eating here again. I had been a few times and they told me that their miso soup was completely vegetarian (no fish). The last time I went the waitress told me no it had fish in it. I asked for it to be subbed out for another of their soups that *is* vegetarian and she charged me $2 for it. Feeding vegetarians fish is bad enough (seriously!) but then charging me for a swap in soup, c'mon.
4955;I really hate to spoil the party with all those five stars ratings around...But:There was a smell of rotten from the sashimi base. Not only mine, but my wife's, too.Dangerous.We were ok, no vomit, no parasites (at least so far), but that was a bit scary - as the last thing you want when eating raw fish is to get something not fresh.Except for that, we liked the menu, it was nice and elaborate. The place itself was clean and inviting, prices low, portions ok - a bit on the smallish side.The servers... Another case of super friendly folks completely wonderful to have around - yet forgetting to do their job. I hate waiving my hand in a futile attempt to attract the attention of the waiters chatting near the bar. And I don't like when I have to leave the tip while paying at the counter. Not fun, not smart.My suggestion would be: Check it out at your own risk. Maybe the chef was in the bad mood that day, who knows? But for us, Sushi House is a definitive no go.
4956;What is up with the size of the shawarma? Smaller than my size 5 shoes. I am very disappointed that they use the small size pita bread for their wraps. Also, meat was dry and pickles need to be more sour. Would go again
4957;Small portions, super fatty (inedible) bacon for at least half the pieces, luke warm coffee, oily food. Same pricing as other breakfast spots that we have tried but a lot less food. Manager was rude and not responsive and slow (only one wait staff for the entire place on a Sunday) hence our order was missing a few items but they gladly charged us for the whole thing, even after we complained. No one to offer coffee refills. Would I come back? No.
4958;I hope I caught them on a bad day.  It's the Monday between Christmas and New Years.  What caught my eye was the "Thick Cut Maplewood Smoked Bacon, cooked to order."  I love bacon.  I'm sure this bacon would be good in the right circumstance by it was clearly pre-cook and cooled (congealed fat between pieces is a dead give away)... Again this could work, but it was cold to the touch. They nailed the eggs and toast.  My order was served relatively quickly.  I had to ask a second time for my coffee and water... Then a third time for the water.  The coffee was watery (again, maybe a bad day... Because it smelled great)Tough to imagine coming back, but if it was busy and they had to cook fresh bacon or had some staff management it might be better
4959;Host was rude and their drink policy is ridiculous. We had just grabbed a coffee and were hoping to eat here. As we waited for a table and we're finally seated, we were advised of the outside drink policy. We complied with their request, but then they tried to charge us for their own coffee, JUST to use their cup!  Never again will I return here and just be aware of the shoddy service.
4960;Overrated! Wow, by looking at these reviews its obvious the masses are content with mediocrity! If you haven't eaten in places across the country you wouldn't know any better. The coffee is some of the worst I've tasted like hot water. My egg breakfast was extremely bland. Potatoes were nothing special. For the price, this is my second time and both experiences were disappointing. The only positive was the friendly staff, even though they got the order wrong. I won't be back.
4961;I left without eating.  We dropped into Rodney's on the way to a show after studying their reviews.  On the way in, we passed the fenced in outdoor seating area, which seemed lively.  Upon entering we were greeted by the hostess and asked if we would prefer outdoor or indoor seating.  We expressed a preference for outdoor, because it was a warm, sunny afternoon.  We were advised that a table should be opening in a few minutes, and sat in the chairs in front of the hostess station.  A couple who arrived just after us sat to our right in the waiting area.Within minutes, a young woman strolls in off the street and asks the hostess if she can sit on the patio, and the waitress says no problem and waves her on.  Then the couple to our right is escorted to the patio.  Without being asked, the waitress volunteers that they arrived after us but had a reservation, and it should only be a few more minutes.  This is where  things started to get weird.  We were moved from in front of the hostess station to an indoor 
4962;First time at Rodney's and will never go back. Went for dinner with a group of 20 and our server provided the WORST service ever. She was not knowledgable, rude and told us that we couldn't order a lot because it would be too complicated for her. Oysters were served without sauces which we had to flag her down and ask for. Sauces were taken away before oysters were finished. Meals came out at different times which meant that half the table were finished their dinners before others have even received theirs. Couldn't flag her down to take drink orders and had to order with someone else. The list goes on and on.Worst part of this experience was that an email was sent to the management team detailing the various complaints but was told that Rodney's Oyster House made an exception to accommodate such a large group. That the final numbers "thew them off" which went from 17 to 20... funny how 3 individuals could make such a difference.So if you are looking to have dinner here with more that 8 people good luck w
4963;Went down hill. Went last night. I live in Toronto and my mom in PEI so between us we know seafood and I used to work in the restaurant industry and know service: Service was bad even though they were not busy on a Wed. My male waiter with an accent fits into what Rodney's visually but he can't wait tables to save his life (even though he wrote everything down on a pad). The Calamari never came and my soup never came. I asked for the soup after 10 min of waiting (and no waiter returning) and they brought it out. It was the last item on the bill telling me it was forgotten (Like the Calamari that didn't appear on the bill). Food - the items that we receive (as noted above some they just forgot about) were okay but not great. The $29.00 Lobster roll should be one of the best items on the menu but it does not stand up to anything I have had in PEI or Toronto. It's bland and greesy and the worst part is that it contains  a lot of under-cooked bacon instead of Lobster. It's not big and for the money you would 
4964;All the hype around this place didn't make much sense to me. Maybe years of living on the West Coast and enjoying fresh seafood made me biased, but... Clams were boiled in water. Chowder was watery too. Tacos - flavorless. The only thing that I liked were fries that came with mussels and bread with butter. Is it worth a $90 meal?
4965;Went to the Oyster Festival where I paid $34 per person. According to the website it included 2 drinks and 1 food item per person. On the website food items were described as oysters, mussels, lobsters and burgers. When went to the festival they were charging an extra $20 for the lobster! False advertisement! They should had informed the customers that the lobsters were not included in the admission for the festival.  Many festival attendees had the same issue. Would not go to the restaurant or festival again.
4966;ordered a ceviche tricolor only to be told 20mins later that they didn't have any. bad attitude from the server, no sincerity in the apology. 0/10 in my opinion
4967;Even 1 STAR is way too much credit for this unprofessional so called establishment! The service was not there. We sat at the bar in front of the Oyster Chef/Shucker where we saw a dirty and slimy towel right in front of us. He throw the shells at the disposer where it was located very close to our face and it splashed slimes all over my husbands shirt.We were shocked to see two staffs behind the oyster bar drinking a full glass of Bourbon and cheered with using foul language. All we heard was F--- words and loud laughters from the servers.The menu is small with very little option on food. VERY expensive. Overall, we do not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
4968;I like some seafood but I'm not a big fan of oysters, but one of my friend loves to come here whenever he's in town, so I'm glad they expanded the menu some.  We've come a handful of times, but this past experience we had was terrible.  A group of us went, and spent well over $300 yet we were treated like absolute scum.  We tried to make conversation with the servers and shuckers and we were either ignored or given short, one word answers brushing us off. They didn't seem to have any problems conversing with the other patrons, but they clearly had a problem with us.  Now I'm sure people may read this thinking maybe they ignored us because we were drunk and belligerent.  Well I personally was sober, and my other friends had a few drinks but were not even loud, let alone belligerent.  And if for some reason the servers thought they were too drunk than they should have stopped serving them alcohol rather than taking our money yet treating us like we didn't deserve to be there.It's really unfortunate, because
4969;Well - regretfully - I am dishing out a 1 star rating.A longtime Torontonian friend who was returning for a visit really had a craving to go here.  Meanwhile, I don't even eat oysters.The food was just fine ... but the service on a slow afternoon (literally 6-8 people in the whole restaurant), these 3 front of house staff couldn't get it right.  And they really didn't give a sh#t either.  I can't even remember the last time I left a $0 tip - that's right - a big ol donut ---- but I just couldn't stomach giving these guys a single cent.  It was that bad.I guess that explains why it was so slow.  Poor Rodney's.  At least they're popular with the people who "used to go there" back in the day and return to remember the good ol days.  But boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
4970;We went there before a Mirvish show and was really disappointing. I know it is a seafood restaurant and was expected to pay a little more. However, a small size gumbo was $14. When we ordered a plate of scampi, it literally was just that. Three small scampi in a very watered down butter sauce, with absolutely no starch to come with it. It would have been nice if it was either 1- stated on the menu or 2- stated by the waiter.Right, the waiter. He was so rude, only stopped by once during the whole meal. When the plate of scampi came, we asked what would be the best way to eat them. He said "just open them and split it" We know that we had to open them and split them so that we won't be eating the shell, but we would appreciate a little more instructions. Could he not see that we are don't eat seafood often?Going back to the scampi, they are definitely very small. the sauce was tasteless and all this cost us a grand $23.Great, this was the most unsatisfying $50 meal we have ever had. Especially for a se
4971;My girlfriend and I went there for her birthday. The food was great (we had an assortment of oysters and scallops) but the staff was most unwelcoming. They made us feel as if we should have never came there. Waitress was rude, when i asked a question she gave me a snarky remark and when i went up to pay for food (because no one would come with the credit card machine) the waitress thought we were going to dine and dash. It's a shame that a birthday dinner turned out that way. But as I said before the food is great, we just had issues with staff.
4972;My girlfriend and I came here for my birthday, so I could have some nice seafood and try an oyster for the first time. We were sat at the bar, where we were nearly ignored by our server.  We weren't spending very much money (she's vegan (and could only have the house salad) and I only wanted a couple oysters, a few glasses of wine, and an entree).  Our server seemed extremely annoyed, and spent very little time with us, even after I asked for some recommendations (which he rushed through). I ordered a lobster club, which was average at best. My girlfriend mentioned that it was my birthday to one of the workers (I assume the manager?) at some point, and after our meal I was brought a chocolate mousse by our server with a birthday candle in it, which was unrequested, but appreciated.  I was finally beginning to forgive for the lack of service, until my waiter brought me the bill with a $7 charge for chocolate mousse that I did not order or even want, and that I thought was a gift from the restaurant.  I am a 20
4973;Food was okay, nothing impressed me much. I can go elsewhere for seafood. But the SERVICE...The hostess who greeted my group was very rude. But whatever, I didn't care much since she isn't the one serving us. HOWEVER, my server was worse!!I was sitting in the bar area and our male server is actually one of the guys behind the bar dealing with the oysters...so I am not sure if I should call him a server? or just someone handling oysters at the oyster bar. Anyways , this guy was so rude. So rude to the point that I nearly had to get up to speak up. I wanted to leave so badly due to the horrible service. But because a friend of mine really wanted to have oysters, we decided to stay. The server was very impatient with us and he looked very frustrated when my friend was asking about some oysters on the menu. Then when my friend told me she wanted to order pasta in addition to the oysters, he replied back " ok HOLD ON! let me deal with one thing at a time and get the oysters done with first" . After the ser
4974;Someone should teach the hostess a lesson in customer service. Read some of the reviews and really wished we could've had the chance to try this place. However, we left within a minute following a very cold reception we received from the rudest hostess I've ever met. Without passing judgement, she scoffed at us for not having a reservation, reinforcing the King West stereotype that everyone should wait in line even though the place is empty. On top of that, she talked down on us as if we were being unreasonable (which we were totally not) and tried to make a "joke" out of it because she has messed up... Honestly I have never been given such rude service before even sitting down! It's okay though, it's not like this was the only restaurant to be. Get over your heads.Ps. If there was an option to give this place 0 stars, I would.
4975;We came from Los Angeles  for the Grey cup because we like to travel and it was refreshingly not the NFL or USA.  We had great oysters but later the too cool for us hipster bartenders were overheard blatantly laughing at my friend  because he was a sports fan.  I try to understand differences and snap judgements but I cant make an excuse for this blatant bold disregard.  I get everyone should fly their individual flag, but being mean bc you don't like the same things is just being a bully.   It was a vibe drainer, we were having so much fun till then.  My friend asked me 2x as we walked out if that really just happened, of course I had to be honest. It was our first time to Toronto so it sucks but what the f*^# ever. There must be many spots  that appreciate patronage. Tomorrow is another day in Toronto.  We got this!Update we had delicious ramen at Momofuko for lunch and a ridiculously great meal at Buco for dinner.  It had amazing charcuterie and cheeses.  Nice vibe but even better food.  Skip "hot-Rods
4976;Porn in the bathroom. I'm not against porn or anything, but it's really poor taste to have it posted in a bathroom in a restaurant. I don't care if it's "artsy" by being black and white, but I go to the bathroom to pee not to look at girls spreading their legs.
4977;Very disappointed.  Bought a box full of desserts, served them when we got home and guests all complained they were very stale. Tastes like they were sitting for days. Even the cream in the cannoli is hard and crusted.
4978;If you like a dingy place with horribly rude service and mostly terrible dishes then this is the perfect place for you.  The place is very dirty and musty.  The waitresses were very rude, pushy and arrogant.  Everyone was served and there was no queue.  We were told we had to order everything at once.  A gimmick to order a lot up front $$$.  The food was mostly bad, with only one or two decent items, but the portions were enough to feed an infant with no appetite, and at a high price tally.The most irritating aspect, all else aside, was seeing a hand reach into your personal space over your shoulders, head, etc. to grab plates that weren't even empty and food still in progress of being consumed.  Not to mention lifting the cups and drinks and moving them around our space as if it was some kind of chessboard.  Horrible horrible experience.The selection of drinks is pathetic.  I don't see the craze over this place at all.  There are way way way better places to enjoy in Toronto.  And since this is a "sharin
4979;I was so excited to try this place after reading so many positive reviews about it but upon arriving, I became extremely disappointed.First, we came as a group of 6 and waited for almost 2 hours before we got a table. It's super chilly outside and the waitress wouldn't let us wait inside because it'd be "too cramped" if we stayed so we just froze outside. We finally get a table and the portions were super tiny for the prices we paid in comparison to other tapas places we've tried. Some dishes were also really salty. The miso ice cream was pretty good, as was the egg.Then came our bill... We didn't want to tip to begin with but since we were a group of 6, we had a mandatory group gratuity... Of 20%!!! That's ludicrous as normally it's only 15-18%. I definitely do not feel they deserve 20%. It wasn't even advertised anywhere !! For those reasons, I would not come back.
4980;We were on a tour of the hood and stumbled across Hanmoto - looked interesting - I walked in - curious - one of the male staff was standing there in plaid shirt and told me what type of food they were serving  - I initially said 'oh, sushi' and he properly corrected me...BUT, his energy was so off-putting, cold, silently judgmental and unwelcoming I turned around and left and told me friend we were 'too old' to eat there --we are hard core Toronto foodies ....this type of energy kills the soul - if you are reading this - think about your behavior and try to work on it - you are in the HOSPITALITY industry. George Brown offers some great courses during the day.
4981;I've been to Odd Seoul several times and have always enjoyed the food and service despite the typical busy Friday/Saturday nights so I thought to try Hanmoto. Definitely not worth the 1 hour wait. I was very disappointed with the level of service from the staff and would not recommend coming here. The staff was rude and condescending. This was the first time I left a restaurant without finishing my meal.
4982;TLDR: food was decent but ruined by long wait times, poor service, and lack of responsibility by wait staff and restaurant manager.Food is decent but service is terrible.  Came here on a Friday night with a group of 5, busy spot which was a good sign.  We were told the wait would be an hour so we left our name and went to grab a drink.  Came back 1.5 hours later and they said the table should be ready shortly.  About 10 minutes passes and they offered to seat us at a smaller table that was suitable for 3 or 4 people while we waited.  I made it clear to the hostess who sat us at the smaller table that we'd like to sit at the larger table for 6 once ready given we had waited almost 2 hours at that point.  After a few tapas (10 minutes) we see that the larger table is getting their bill so we ask to see if we can move.  They said that's not possible since they had already let another wait list guest know that the table was ready and they were on their way.  We told them multiple times that we only sat there o
4983;Worst service ever! Waited forever to get a table. Waitress all seem unhappy working there. Some dishes are very salty. It's really dark inside, food comes so slow. Don't waste your time and money going there. If you want to have izakaya or bar drinks, go anywhere else! Keep away from there!
4984;I was really excited to go here. But I was thoroughly disappointed and this is why:I went for brunch there with my sister. Right off the bat, they couldn't accommodate my request to substitute the prosciutto (which came with the poached eggs) with something vegetarian (I suggested tomatoes). Apparently, they don't do substitutions. Fine. So the server suggested I order the Eggs in Purgatorio, which is vegetarian. It looked good, so I said sure. When they came, the eggs were so underdone that the whites were still clear. So the server brought me another one and the eggs were STILL undercooked. It was supposed to come with smoked fontina cheese on top....no cheese. So when the sever walked by, I asked if it was supposed to come with cheese (showing her that there was clearly none). She told me "There WAS cheese...on the top." I'm not an idiot. I know what cheese tastes/looks like. There was no cheese! The whole experience was such a bummer! They didn't do anything to remedy the situation, so we paid full pric
4985;I waited for 45 minutes for a table of two. It also took long time to get my pizza which most of it was burned. I have no idea why this restaurant is so popular!!!
4986;I honestly don't understand where all of these positive reviews are coming from. Upon reading these reviews we decided to give it a try. Came on a Sunday evening for dinner. Pros- polite and professional servers Cons-the food was overpriced and tasted nowhere near as good as the reviews mention. We decided to try the overhyped "Mafalde Ai Funghi (mushroom pasta)" which is cheap pasta mixed with mushroom broth and cream/sour cream (yes that's where the taste comes from). We also tried the "Rigatoni Bolognise" which wasn't any better. For an Italian place there is nothing authentic about these pastas. They shouldn't cost more than $8.00 each especially given the quality. The Carpaccio (raw beef) appetizer was literally just that. Raw beef with some prosciutto sprinkled on top for $15.00.For those that actually like this place, you really need to get out more and try some real authentic Italian food. Definitely would not recommend.
4987;I'm sad to say I have to change my review for Gusto 101 based on a recent experience. We came back here, remembering how cool this place was last time. The service was really slow this time, our waiter took forever to come over and ask for our drink order. I asked for the sangria (I had it last time and it was awesome), but he said it was not available because they ran out of Sangria mix. He didn't offer me an alternative so I looked at the menu and chose the house white wine. He then said that the tap for this was broken, and again offered no alternative for us even when we asked what he would recommend instead. He just said "We don't have anything else at that price point".We found something to order for drinks and it took a long time to have them delivered to our table. We ordered food, and when it came my boyfriend's pasta was cold. We had to tell the waiter, who got us another one. My boyfriend told me this was also not hot, and the pasta didn't seem cooked very well. He was bummed.My Zuppa di Poll
4988;I was very excited to come to this place for my friends 30th birthday.  I can tell you it was a mission finding a place in the city to accommodate a large party for a Friday night.  After months of searching and reading lots of party contracts from various restaurants we landed on  Gusto 101.   The reason we picked Gusto was 1. location, 2. reviews on food, 3. the minimum spend wasn't astronomical and they mentioned we would have a semi-private seating space. Well, let me breakdown my/our experience as things started going from bad to worse.   We arrived and went upstairs to the "semi-private" dining area, which was their rooftop, and I guess the semi-private portion of the space was that we were placed along the wall.  There was zero privacy let alone semi-privacy.  Nevertheless, we were happy to be celebrating. We started to grab our seats and I had switched from sitting next to someone to across from them.  The waiter, in one of the rudest tones stated "If you are going to move around then you can't ha
4989;I get the hype. But I don't get the shady customer service/experience. I called a week before for a group reservation. They told me I'd hear back in 24 hours. Didn't get a ring back, but didn't mind so I followed up 2 days later. I got the save message, that I'd hear back in 24 hours. At this point, I thought they'd get back to me quickly, but nah. So I called again and got the same non sense. As this was for a birthday, my girlfriend decides to call. She get's the runaround and eventually gets snarky service from the person on the phone.So again, cool that people like this place. But shady service.
4990;Not a fan. Took forever to be seated on a Wednesday night after we missed the text msg notice. Bruschetta was more like grilled cheese with mushrooms than the Italian classic. Entrees were completely mistimed to each other so one person was served and the other waited. We sent the too-early food back after 5 minutes, waited another 15, then the first dish was overcooked and the late meal was chewy undercooked chicken. Bleh!
4991;I went here last Thursday with a group of 11 for dinner. We had a reservation and were seated right away. We had:- Kale salad: absolute delicious with a hint of sweetness to it. It didn't have a bitter or dull taste at all. - Salmone alla brace: once again, perfectly made. I definitely recommend this. - Polpette and spinaci pizzas: they're very thin but difficult to cut/chew because it was almost mushy. The taste doesn't even compare to pizza stores. I definitely wouldn't recommend getting pizza here. - Pollo alla griglia: the seasoning for the chicken is amazing. Highly recommend. - Mafalde ai funghi: if you like mushrooms, get it. The flavoring and consistency of the pasta are amazing. - Tiramisu dessert: don't recommend at all. Tiramisu should have a slightly bitter taste but this tiramisu wasn't just slightly bitter--it just tasted awful. We ordered three of those for the entire table and not one of them were even half finished. The major cons to this place are the atmosphere and service. We wen
4992;With all the buzz I heard about Gusto, I was EXTREMELY disappointed. The chairs and tables are simple cheap patio style furniture, low lights, warehouse atmosphere which is dimmed and romantic lighting.. there are two levels to this place...we came here because we heard the food was amazing and top ten Italian restaurants in Toronto. We ordered steak tar tar, gusto burger and meat ball pizza and escargot. The pizza was DISGUSTING AND HORRIBLE!!!! It was sauggy, the meat balls were factory made frozen meat balls. They literally cut the meat balls in half and put two big pieces on each slice. Steak tar tar (which is one of my fav dishes) was VERY BLAND. I had to put balsamic vinaigrette on it for taste. The gusto burger was OKAY!! NOTHING special about it.The escargot was decent. The drinks were good. I guess that's why people highly rate it. Anything tastes good when you are drunk. Overall, I would come back here only if I want to have a night of drinking. Defiantly not coming for the food.
4993;I went here once for dinner on a Friday night. Let me assure you, I will NEVER step foot in here again! The noise level in here was atrocious! I could not hear anything anyone at my table was saying unless they yelled into my ear! This "restaurant" is more like a club atmosphere based on the extremely high noise level and industrial appearance. My ears were actually ringing for a couple of minutes after we stepped out.The food itself was mediocre at best. There is not a single dish worth the visit to this place. It is not a place you go to for an enjoyable, relaxing dinner. It's also not a place to go to if you'd like to be able to get out of your seat without encroaching on the personal space of the people sitting behind you. To summarize, only go here if you enjoy feeling claustrophobic and don't plan on conversing with your date/friends.
4994;Was served a Chocolate eclair, let me tell you, I can get a better eclair from Tim Hortons. The whipped cream was FAKE!!! and the pastry part was flavourless and GROSS.YUCK YUCK YUCK
4995;Tried the chef's menu - the first sorbet was delicious, and there were a couple good dishes as well but overall all the food was deep-fried or used the fattiest part of the meat. An entire menu was very greasy and the oil/fat was staying in my mouth a whole time as deep-fried/high fat parade of the course comes to your table. The idea of the asian fusion food is unique but it's over priced (+$70 after tax and tip per person without any drinks) for the quality of the food. They use a lot of truffle oil but it's not classy to use it in almost every dishes.. Customer service was fine but not excellent for the price you pay.
4996;My friends have warned me about this place. But despite their warning I still went with a couple of friends from NY. I give it 1 stars because the service was great and attentive. Most dishes tasted like it was made by different people and then plated together without a discussion. The pairings of flavour were some of the strangest I have ever seen. It's all Asian ingredients that's the only common thread, but most ingredients were things that should not go together. I didn't like the Big Mac Bao, the meat was watery and grey because it's steamed, mixed with Big Mac sauce it's just a disaster. Fried watermelon was ok but pork floss was just straight out the jar then topped with some raw bean sprouts. Not worth the money. It was pricey and we left hungry. If you want real Asian food go to Chinatown or Markham, there are also lots more well executed Fusion Cuisine in Toronto. The decor is really nice but that's not hard to achieve because it is just an exact carbon copy of Bao Bei Restaurant in Vancouver.
4997;I was impressed by the reviews. Tried it once. It is nothing like Mandi...Even the spices weren't the same. It did give me this encouragement, that I should cook Mandi at home. It was still better than the one I had from Al Monasabah..and, I am not a good cook :)
4998;Was really disappointed with this place. First time I went they said they don't have any food left and I have to call in before I come... With all these reviews I was still tempted to go back and called to place a order. Went to pick it up and literally waited 30 minutes till someone served me. The guy was busy in the kitchen and not paying attention. The chicken itself was good but the rice was definitely undercooked. The sauce they give they cheapen out on. Will definitely not be going back again.
4999;Came here with my family on Eid ul Fitr for dinner. I know, bad idea considering Eid on Gerrard, but we were desperate and hungry. This seemed to be the only place that had enough seats for my family of 5 people. The line was super long, but it was Eid, so I don't blame anyone. My family and I had our orders ready, and when we ordered, the man at the cash register informed us that there was no chicken in their kitchen. This was a real bummer considering my whole family basically wanted some kind of chicken (chicken breast, chicken tikka etc). So quickly, noting the line behind us, we ordered beef "footlong" kebabs instead. My brother ordered the mutton chops. In about three minutes, our orders of kebabs arrived with naan, some chutney, and some basic salad (few pieces of torn lettuce and chunks of onions). The man at the front informed us that the mutton chops would take another 10 minutes. The naan and kebabs were cold once we put them in our mouths. We were so hopeless at this point, however, because we
5000;Well , I have eaten here a few times before, but after what I witnessed tonight, NEVER EVER AGAIN. I witnessed the most disgusting thing.  I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the owner take some salad and sauces that was left by previous customers dirty tray back in with the new stuff.  DISGUSTINGLY NASTY AND GROSS. This was food that the previous customer was eating.  No frigging way I will ever be eating here again.
